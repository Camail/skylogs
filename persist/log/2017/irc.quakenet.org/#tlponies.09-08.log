01:46:06 <skrm> i havent even watched the last GoT because the second to last was boring as hell
01:46:10 <Camail> best cartoon since the original run of futurama
01:46:17 <DuB> I'm like 3 episodes from the end of korra, halfway into a season of monogatari, halfway into LWA, and a bunch of other stuff...
01:46:30 <Camail> DuB you picked a good time to stop watching korra
01:46:32 <ZK> also, dont old people watch mostly reality tv?
01:46:34 <Camail> just let it be that
01:46:41 <DuB> Haha
01:46:42 <Bio> Rick and Morty is my fabvorite anime
01:46:43 <Camail> dont watch anything else, let it be pure
01:46:50 <ZK> those two episodes in season 2 are awesome
01:46:53 <ZK> watch those
01:47:02 <ZK> avatar WAN
01:47:09 <Camail> i disliked a vast majority of season 2
01:47:20 <Camail> wait which show
01:47:22 <ZK> oh yea, season 2 wasnt good, but avatar WAN man
01:47:26 <ZK> korra
01:47:37 <Camail> honestly i only like korra episodes 1-10
01:47:48 <Camail> s2,3,4 and wahetever were just TLA lite
01:47:51 <Camail> idc about those
01:47:57 <Camail> s2 was fucking awful
01:47:58 <ZK> the avatar origins story was my fav in korra
01:48:02 <Camail> 3 and 4 were fine
01:48:28 <Camail> but mannnn i will still say that korra was shaping up to be my favorite piece of media
01:48:53 <Camail> JUST STAY INT HE CITY YOU FUCKING WRITERS
01:49:21 <Camail> no fucking blood bending, no grand scheme for power, tell the god damn story, resolve the tension
01:49:31 <Camail> actually address the bender v non-bender social structure
01:49:36 <Camail> INSTEAD OF FUCKING FORGETTING ABOUT IT

01:50:06 <skrm> you ok?
01:50:08 <Camail> DuB  you know how i get when someone mentions korra
01:50:10 <Camail> this is your fault
01:50:16 <DuB> My b
01:50:27 <Camail> yea, you own that b
01:50:31 <Camail> it was sent to UR address
01:50:42 <Camail> the b was sitting on your doorstep
01:51:08 <DuB> o
01:51:09 <DuB> so
01:51:26 <skrm> so
01:51:29 <DuB> I have to take some random literature class to finish up a general grad requirement.
01:51:34 <DuB> Eng 201
01:51:42 <DuB> First day, class is like 70% freshmen
01:51:46 <DuB> Little KIIIIIIIIDS
01:51:57 <Camail> ahahaha
01:52:00 <skrm> whats the next step up from a freshman
01:52:00 <DuB> And the class is so friggin' easy and they're all takin' notes on everything 'n stuff
01:52:01 <DoT_> ewwww  youths
01:52:03 <DuB> Was really funny
01:52:06 <Camail> omg, didnt tihnk about that whole mormon thing
01:52:10 <Camail> where freshman are literally 18
01:52:14 <Camail> and you are what, 22?
01:52:22 <DuB> 23
01:52:23 <skrm> 19
01:52:25 <Camail> ahaha
01:52:28 <ZK> hehe
01:52:36 <ZK> dub must feel so old all the time
01:52:57 <Camail> impress them with your piety dub
01:53:02 <Camail> then abuse that trust
01:53:05 <DuB> lel
01:53:15 <DuB> I impressed some with my books...
01:53:19 <Camail> women dont have to do missionary stuff right?
01:53:31 <DuB> They can, lots more do now than used to
01:53:36 <Camail> makes sense
01:53:50 <DuB> We got sponsor-gifted like 3k pages of the internal revenue code by EY for our research class
01:54:07 <Camail> did you cry when you saw it
01:54:09 <Camail> i would
01:54:18 <DuB> So I was lugging those around to my class and plunked them down on my desk
01:54:30 <DuB> Little freshmen like O_O WHASSAT
01:54:30 <Camail> tell them that's for 300 level classes
01:54:34 <DuB> Haha
01:54:45 <skrm> big boy on campus
01:54:55 <Camail> or "oh its the book for this class? you didnt get it?"
01:55:32 <skrm> does that mean you are a sophomore now DuB 
01:55:52 <DuB> Kinda looking forward to that class now, will be nice to have a chill english class where I can just read some classics and it's eeeeeeeezzzzzzzzz
01:56:00 <ZK> hehe
01:56:01 <motbob> i thought s2 of korra was ok
01:56:04 <DuB> Senior, skrm!
01:56:31 <skrm> almost an adult then!
01:56:32 <Camail> s2 couldnt decide if it was about korra or tenzin
01:56:44 <Camail> and looked terrible
01:57:05 <DuB> Master program starts senior year, so only have to pay 1 year of graduate tuition instead of 2.
01:57:37 <DuB> Does anyone think Korra > TLA ?
01:57:40 <DuB> Curious
01:58:06 <skrm> pls the TLA movie was the best of that franchise
01:58:14 <DuB> ...
01:58:28 <Camail> i didnt even watch all of tla but i think its better as a full series
01:58:30 <skrm> what happens when you're on the last year of your masters then
01:58:36 <Camail> he gets his phd
01:58:37 <skrm> are you a senior senior then
01:58:43 <motbob> tla came first so that's kinda unfail
01:58:45 <motbob> unfair
01:58:47 <DuB> Grad student. :P
01:58:56 <motbob> it introduced most of the cool ideas
01:59:07 <skrm> this is weird
01:59:08 <Camail> i did enjoy korra s3/4 with the short hair saga
01:59:10 <motbob> so it would probably take a huge effort for korra to be beter
01:59:14 <skrm> why dont just call it year 1-5
01:59:46 <Camail> there are no names for grad, because different specializations have different, or sometimes no, names
02:01:27 <ZK> yea, some grads can stay as grads for soooo long
02:05:32 <ZK> ooooh telltale walking dead season 1 is free on humble :o
