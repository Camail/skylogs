06:27:41 <motbob> hey, what's an english expression for letting your feelings about a broken relationship go
06:30:49 <motbob> or to cut off feelings of love in general
06:31:28 <motbob> like, if I wanted to name a bar after that concept ("Come here to drink and got over past flings,") what would be a snappy name for it
06:41:17 <Camail> well i'd start out thinking about expressions about lightening the burden
06:41:29 <Camail> people generally use weight as a metaphor for that kind of negative feeling

20:58:08 <Phearlock> Is calling someone a tart an insult?
20:58:36 <skram> yeah
20:59:58 <Phearlock> So we need to find the guy fromm bakewell who was called a tart
21:00:04 <Phearlock> and lick him or something
21:00:09 <Phearlock> so we can find out what it tatstes like
21:00:37 <Phearlock> If only there was some easier way
21:00:44 <skram> I think it would most likely be a woman phearlock
21:01:26 <Phearlock> I will trust in your expert opinion
21:01:33 <skram> tart
21:01:33 <skram> A very tasty pastery, or a very tasty prostitute.
