09:47:05 <Camail> so hollow knight has optional platforming
09:47:11 <DoT|Phone1> oh boy
09:47:14 <Camail> with super cool lore behind it
09:47:18 <DoT|Phone1> I love jumping puzzles
09:47:39 <Camail> jumping puzzles arent a real thing
09:47:49 <Camail> this is bug gymnastics
09:47:49 <DoT|Phone1> shhh
09:48:01 <Camail> with spinning death blades
09:48:09 <DoT|Phone1> nice
09:48:54 <Camail> i had to kill 2 hard optional bosses just to get access to this insane labyrinth of platforms and death zones
09:49:00 <Camail> but the loooooore implications
09:49:09 <Camail> and everything looks so cool
09:49:36 <DoT|Phone1> it's a game I will get on sale
09:49:47 <Camail> I'm still missing two and a half badges...
09:49:55 <Camail> dont ask me how i have half a badge
09:50:01 <Camail> I am not entirely sure myself
09:50:15 <Camail> and honstely its even more troubling than not having a badge at all
09:51:19 <Camail> if you can find an up to date (or at least 1.0.6) torrent, I can download it then sen it to you over irc
09:51:41 <Camail> and 1.0.5 isn't even a big deal until you reach mid-late game
09:52:41 <DoT|Phone1> over irc?
09:53:10 <DoT|Phone1> Will have a look even I get home
09:53:21 <Camail> yea irc has a file transfer protocol
09:53:24 <Camail> because why not
09:53:28 <Camail> thats how people used to pirate
09:53:32 <Camail> a loooot
09:54:08 <DoT|Phone1> torrents and LANs is what I used
09:55:14 <DoT|Phone1> OC. a monthly LAN of about 1000 to 1500 people had a dedicated file sharing program you got when you arrived
09:55:23 <DoT|Phone1> in cape town
09:55:29 <Camail> you dirty pirates
09:56:15 <DoT|Phone1> some people arrived on Friday. set things to dl then came back on Sunday for their pc. Haha

20:34:59 <Dot`> when does your course finish?
20:35:07 <skrma> friday
20:35:36 <skrma> Ill be home by 4-5
20:36:01 <Dot`> i was trying to recall when dnd was semi planned for
20:36:20 <skrma> sat right?
20:36:39 <Dot`> i cant recall if fri or sat, but you did mention your course
20:37:10 <Dot`> i can do both
20:37:19 <skrma> i think we did decide on sat
20:41:17 <Dot`> makes sense
20:42:45 <reification> i can’t remember at all… :/
20:43:01 <Dot`> can you do satetrday?
20:43:21 <reification> either should be fine
20:45:27 <skrma> I dont think I wanna go back to the bar to dance with old women tonight Dot` 
20:45:31 <skrma> Does that make me lame?
20:45:52 <Dot`> bars are boring places skram
20:46:32 <skrma> Dont you want to meet new and weird people?
20:47:18 <Dot`> yea, but not ones that get fun from drinking
20:47:28 <Dot`> your talking to the wrong person skram, i am lame
20:51:37 <reification> to be fair consuming depressants and having loud background noise could be seen as not ideal environment for some
20:54:33 <skrma> true enough reef
20:58:52 <Dot`> what you plan to do instead skram?
