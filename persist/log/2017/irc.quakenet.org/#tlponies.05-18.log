23:07:00 <Camail> its fine
23:07:24 <Camail> the playstyle is different from cr and normal aq inc
23:07:40 <Camail> the way they talk is confusing tho
23:08:00 <Camail> the perspective shifts from ooc to 1st, to 3rd person
23:08:27 <Camail> so its closer to a normal average joe game
23:09:07 <Camail> its interesting, rough but interesting
23:09:30 <Dot`> may check it out soon then
