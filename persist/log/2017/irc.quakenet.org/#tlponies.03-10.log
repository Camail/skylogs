01:00:33 <Cane> Dot`, help.
01:00:41 <Cane> I have a problem. I can't stop thinking about STALKER since you mentioned it.
01:01:46 <Dot`> its the most evil of games
01:05:44 <Crisium> new zelda is very good game
01:05:55 <Dot`> http://imgur.com/gallery/6RW89N9
01:05:59 <Crisium> ocassional framerate going to crap sucks tho
01:08:57 <Camail> Cane you just got to think about it real hard and repeat after me:
01:09:01 <Camail> Get out of here, stalker!
01:09:37 <Cane> Camail, now I just want to join Freedom and kill that fucker.
01:10:01 <Camail> Get out of here, stalker!
01:11:04 <Camail> S?talker is a special jank
01:11:13 <Camail> i hate/love the quality
01:12:57 <Dot`> liek arma its an amazing game and amazingly broken
01:14:25 <Camail> i should mod out SoC
01:14:29 <Camail> i only ever palyed vanilla
01:14:37 <Camail> but i already palyed it twice...
01:14:58 <Dot`> cane know sall the good mods
01:15:08 <Dot`> he spent far too long testing the bad ones
01:15:09 <Dot`> :P
01:15:32 <Cane> I still have the scars to show for it.
01:15:49 <Cane> Some times I claw awake in the night, gasping the word "STALKERSOUP" right before I begin weeping.
01:22:21 <Dot`> there there cane, its over now
01:24:02 <Camail> is it
01:24:06 <Camail> it's never over
01:48:15 <Camail> bio bioooooooooo
02:04:22 <Bio> asdf
02:04:43 <Bio> some tard hit me and my mom on the way back from the appt.
02:04:53 <Bio> middle of rush hour traffic on the highway
02:04:55 <Bio> we ok
02:05:01 <Bio> cars are fuktup
02:06:12 <Crisium> oh no :(
02:06:38 <Bio> yeh
02:06:42 <Crisium> glad you're not hurt.  hopefully insurance takes care of fixing costs
02:07:00 <Bio> yeah, me mum has insurance, but she didn't. 
02:07:22 <Bio> so yeah, that person is in for a rough couple of months or longer
02:07:43 <Crisium> how do people not have insurance, fml
02:08:09 <Camail> the people who get into accidents during rush hour are also stupid enough to not have insurance
02:08:35 <Bio> apparently the story is that she was getting a divorce and the hubby was the one fronting the bill for it, and he let it go in jan.
02:08:47 <Crisium> see, i was thinking that too cam, must be a connection
02:09:13 <Camail> well its super illegal to drive without insurance
02:09:37 <Camail> so now she gets to deal with driving without insurance as well as the divorce
02:09:41 <Camail> good fucking luck, lady
02:09:59 <Bio> $300 Fine, 15 Days in Jail, and 4 Points on Your Driving Record for Missouri ‚ÄúNo Insurance‚Äù Ticket. It is illegal to drive a vehicle in Missouri that is not insured, and a judge can fine you up to $300, put you in jail for 15 days, suspend your license, or enter an order of supervision against you for each violation.
02:10:23 <Bio> rip
02:10:38 <Camail> which wont help her divorce case AT ALL
02:10:52 <Crisium> RIP
02:11:10 <Camail> "this lady is a dumb sack of shit, look at this dumb person doing this illegal thing"
02:11:19 <Camail> "can i not give her half the money?"
02:11:27 <Bio> Judge: yeah bro
02:11:33 <Bio> that sounds fly
02:11:42 <Bio> *bangs gavel*
02:13:05 <motbob> doesn't work that way
02:13:19 <motbob> although I guess you probably know that
02:13:40 <Camail> you live in your reality
02:13:42 <Camail> I live in mine
02:13:47 <Bio> Mot, I know everything I know about the law from playing the Ace Attorney games. AKA, everything.
02:13:50 <motbob> if people want to fight a divorce out, they air ALLLLLLL the dirty laundry
02:13:57 <motbob> and judges don't really care
02:14:37 <motbob> what they do care about is stuff like, "Because I was married to him for 30 years, I have no career and now I have no job prospects at all"
02:15:03 <Bio> she was super young, maybe a little older than I
02:18:25 <Camail> but what about "She would rather drive illegally than independently get her own car insurance", isn't that at least a relevant point to bring up?
02:18:46 <Camail> there are so many contextual arguments, i guess
02:19:04 <Camail> but...its can't just be unimportant that a crime happened
02:19:36 <Crisium> but cam, its not enough that your person is clearly innocent
02:19:45 <Crisium> you need to prove the other guy did it or your client is executed
02:19:52 <Crisium> and you only have 3 days
02:20:03 <Bio> ^^^
02:20:07 <Camail> I've never played, or seen, and ace attorney game
02:20:21 <Bio> they are entertaining enough
02:20:21 <Crisium> its ok, Bio has got this case down
02:20:34 <Camail> also is this case in north korea?
02:20:39 <Bio> nah
02:20:42 <Bio> Japanifornia
02:21:29 <Crisium> basically
02:23:49 <Camail> cris i thought juri's s.mk was really good...then i used karin's s.mk and wanted to kill myself
02:27:02 <Crisium> lol
02:27:24 <Crisium> honestly i havent played SF5 since it came out basically
02:28:01 <Crisium> well, i tried alex for a couple days when he came out
02:30:15 <Camail> bio, you still wanna shoot, or no?
02:33:06 <motbob> the question is whether that type of crime is important to the decisio of who gets what during divorce
02:33:31 <motbob> divorce court isn't a place where the court looks into the souls of both people, sees who's the better person, and awards money to him or her
02:33:42 <Bio> prolly not cam. probably gonna be sleep soon
02:33:51 <Camail> k
02:34:17 <motbob> since that's not the process, and shouldn't be, there need to be reasons for the court to move away from the default (marital property is split, property from before the marriage goes back to the owner)
02:35:07 <motbob> "As An ICE Agent, The Best Part Of My Job Is Getting To Work With Children "
02:37:01 <Camail> that looks like a title
02:37:11 <Camail> which could've been phrased better
02:39:57 <motbob> i think it's only subject to a dark interpretation
02:40:27 <motbob> when an ICE agent is working with you, that's not a good thing
02:41:02 <motbob> speaking of ICE, my law professor who was in jail got out, flew to Italy for a funeral, and had all the charges dropped against him
02:41:31 <motbob> he won't come back to teach the class this semester, though

03:19:52 <motbob> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6gm0YjXAAAgwAc.jpg:large Yoko Taro is the creator of the Nier series
03:20:41 <Camail> he's pretty great
03:21:06 <motbob> He made a tweet that was something like, "Because we designed 2B with a big butt, there are a lot of outrageous pictures floating around. The worst part about it all is that it's hard to find the best ones."
03:25:06 <Camail> nier 2 is a really good game
03:25:06 <motbob> or rather, they aren't all in one convenient place
03:25:28 <Camail> he needs to contribute to a booru
03:25:31 <motbob> nier 2. there's a near 2. that's such a funny thought even after it came out
03:25:42 <motbob> wow what a typo
03:26:06 <motbob> there was never going to be a nier 2. NEVER. in fact, how did yoko taro ever get to make another game
03:26:15 <Camail> and with platinum
03:27:11 <Camail> have you played/ seen it yet
03:27:22 <Camail> i was about to spoil then i realized its technically not even out yet in NA
03:27:24 <motbob> i've seen no footage
03:27:43 <Camail> is very good game
03:28:20 <Camail> its the best parts of yoko taro and the best parts of platinum
03:29:17 <motbob> my roommate buys all the good games
03:29:43 <motbob> i have Witcher 3, horizon zero dawn, and some other stuff in the house, but I haven't played them...
03:30:06 <Camail> witcher 3 is a time vampire
03:30:18 <Camail> nier automata >>> witcher 3 for me
03:30:23 <motbob> most games he buys seem time-inefficient
03:30:30 <Camail> and i have 110 hours into witcher 3
03:30:36 <motbob> which is strange for me to say since I have way more free time than him
03:30:51 <Camail> looks like he likes to binge, when he can
03:32:46 <motbob> hot_bid started at BTS last month and now I have a video on the BTS smash channel
03:32:51 <motbob> actually 3

<p class="graph_info">This graph shows the traffic of the tunl0 network interface. Please note that the traffic is shown in bits per second, not bytes. IMPORTANT: On 32-bit systems the data source for this plugin uses 32-bit counters, which makes the plugin unreliable and unsuitable for most 100-Mb/s (or faster) interfaces, where traffic is expected to exceed 50 Mb/s over a 5 minute period.  This means that this plugin is unsuitable for most 32-bit production environments. To avoid this problem, use the ip_ plugin instead.  There should be no problems on 64-bit systems running 64-bit kernels.</p>

21:40:53 <Micen> come to Kentucky dub
21:41:00 <reification> sounds like heresy dub D:
21:41:04 <Micen> (dont actually come, its a black hole that you cant escape)
21:41:23 <DuB`> D:
21:41:53 <skram> :(
21:42:34 <DuB`> I would just move to antarctica but they don't have universities or much internet down there.
21:42:35 <DuB`> I think.
21:42:49 <Micen> move to Alaska. 
21:43:15 <skram> A coworker has a summer job in antarctica DuB`, and he posts pictures on facebook
21:43:21 <skram> so thats a yepperooni on the internets at least
21:43:41 <DuB`> But Micen, then I'd get eated by a bear.
21:44:03 <DuB`> skram, it's decided then.
21:44:03 <Micen> Dub, you are American!
21:44:13 <DuB`> I'm a terrible american.
21:44:18 <DuB`> OFF TO ANTARCTICA
21:44:39 <Micen> Utilize your Second Amendment right!
21:45:02 <Micen> You know what is more dangerous than a bear. A gun. 
21:45:09 <Micen> and more dangerous than that?
21:45:12 <Micen> Bears with guns
21:45:16 <DuB`> Uh oh.
21:45:28 <motbob> bears with guns are about as dangerous as bears without guns
21:45:53 <Micen> Are you sure Mot?
21:46:03 <Micen> have you ever encountered a bear with a gun?
21:46:09 <motbob> i've fought many bears in my day, both with and without guns
21:46:26 <Micen> well okay then. 
21:46:30 <Micen> I trust the expert.
21:49:22 <Micen> DUB!
21:49:25 <Micen> what did you do 
21:49:32 <DuB`> !?
21:49:34 <Micen> I just found out that they are saying no sno here
21:49:40 <DuB`> Whoops.
21:49:46 <DuB`> I promise I didn't steal.
21:49:56 <Micen> I am blaming your lack of art. You did not appease the sno gods for me. 
21:50:43 <DuB`> I dun think sno cares about art.
21:50:51 <DuB`> It IS art!
21:51:14 <Micen> you you make it and then burn it so it gets sent up and comes back down as sno, rite?
