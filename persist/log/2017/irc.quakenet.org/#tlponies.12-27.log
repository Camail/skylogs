10:21:55 <CockRoach|42> <3
10:28:02 <Camail> ok so mario odyssey probably has the best ending sequence of any mario game
10:29:07 <Camail> they really committed hard to making big hits feel big, I think its the first mario to actually use hit stops
10:29:24 <Camail> maybe some of the arms devs were working on it
10:29:59 <Camail> I enjoyed mario more than BoTW, to be honest
10:30:20 <Camail> the micro-objective gameplay style fits mario waaaay better than zelda
10:32:53 <Dot`> and like a phantom in the night, he gone!
