12:31:39 <Dot`> Runbun!
12:31:47 <Dot`> Merry jul
12:31:52 <Dot`> i probably have it spelt wrong
12:33:19 <Runbunny> It's correct
12:33:39 <Runbunny> But you'd default to god jul usually.
12:33:54 <Runbunny> or gl√¶delig jul
12:33:59 <Dot`> its been a year since i sw any of you say it
12:34:03 <Runbunny> :P
12:34:40 <Runbunny> In danish we actually say "Good christmas"
12:34:50 <Dot`> pls
12:35:01 <Dot`> thats not scandanavian
12:35:08 <Runbunny> or formally (or rather more formally) "Merry Christmas" literally.
12:36:15 <Runbunny> However the word "jul" probably comes from the the word "Hjul" which means wheel.
12:36:30 <Runbunny> and it probably has something to do with the winter solstice.
12:37:39 <Dot`> skram help, the danish is educating me
12:38:22 <Runbunny> and you like it!
12:39:08 <Zounds> We have jul in our songs and stuff
12:39:10 <Zounds> but we call it yule
12:39:22 <Zounds> same thing written differently
12:39:22 <skram> anders is talking nonsense
12:40:40 <skram> its from the old norse word for midvinter thing
12:40:45 <Zounds> CR should send me some julmust though
12:41:26 <Runbunny> You mean.... winter solstice ?!?!?!
12:41:39 <Runbunny> Vinter solhverv ?!?!
12:42:00 <skram> well its a lil bit after solstice
12:42:06 <skram> do you not have your PRIMSTAV handy?
