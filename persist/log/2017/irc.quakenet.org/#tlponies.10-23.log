20:09:30 <skrma> might need a better cpu for it to work
20:09:31 <skrma> idk
20:10:15 <Cane> Figured out why my Morrowind would eventually go down to below 30fps some times when indoors in a frequently visited area. There's a bug with one of the interior light mods which caused the light sources to stack, making the interior brighter and brighter and adding work for the shader.
20:10:21 <Cane> Not sure why nobody has noticed this bug with the bloody thing.
