02:43:54 <DuB`> Hio
02:54:30 <Bio> i need one more mon
02:54:36 <Bio> to have all the secondary for vero
02:54:55 <Bio> beast hunter has 6 more lvls
02:55:06 <Bio> grind all day err day
02:55:21 <Bio> also give choc pls
02:55:45 <DuB`> Chocoooo
02:55:54 <DuB`> Devilmon event = good event.
02:56:48 <Bio> inugami is good
02:56:51 <Bio> feeeed bella
02:56:57 <Bio> got 2 today
02:57:39 <Bio> and of course the heal is the last to get a rankup
03:03:06 <DuB`> Heheh
03:03:08 <DuB`> Of course. ;D
03:10:53 <Bio> this game 
03:11:01 <Bio> is grind the game
03:11:08 <Bio> why am I playing it
03:11:21 <Bio> brb, farming faimon some more
03:19:10 <Camail> this fucking game
03:19:19 <Camail> I bought an iphone game thats making me wait an hour
03:22:20 <ZK> NICE
03:27:07 <Camail> nvm you can change the time
03:27:15 <ZK> oh good
03:27:21 <Camail> but i still need to charge my phone so I'll wait....
03:27:29 <Camail> you actually have to change the system clock
03:27:37 <Camail> a la oldschool game haxx
03:27:43 <ZK> oooh, memories
03:27:51 <ZK> theres probably an app that does that EZPZ
03:27:58 <Camail> now its asking me to "jack"
03:28:03 <Camail> and i tried everything i can think of
03:28:07 <Camail> yes, that too
03:28:17 <Camail> its really easy to change your phone clock
03:28:22 <Camail> you just go to settings
03:28:36 <Camail> which i am impressed apple hasnt put it behind lock and key
03:28:45 <Camail> because they do that
03:28:45 <ZK> true
03:30:23 <Camail> oh shit, apparently TB is no longer considered terminally ill with cancer
03:30:36 <ZK> yep, that's really awesome!
03:30:44 <ZK> from terminal to in remission
03:33:09 <Camail> no longer trying to add months, but years
03:33:28 <Camail> it makes sense tho, the reason this type of cancer has a huge mortality rate is it is most common in elderly people
03:33:38 <Camail> so they cant be as invasive with treatments
03:33:58 <Camail> TB strapped in and yelled "FILL ME WITH THE DEATH JUICE, KILL EVERYTHING"
03:34:19 <ZK> And it worked!
03:34:29 <Camail> having lesions in your mouth as a professional speaker must suck
03:39:53 <Camail> oh, figured it out
03:40:00 <Camail> i had to fuck my headphone jack
03:40:16 <ZK> fuck the jack?
03:40:26 <Camail> i needed to plug in the headphones
03:40:30 <Camail> then take thme out
03:40:32 <Camail> then in, then out
03:40:36 <Camail> like 10 times
03:40:38 <ZK> oh ok
03:40:43 <ZK> if that works
03:40:43 <Camail> i needed to jack off my jack
03:40:58 <Camail> but that was the final one
03:41:14 <Camail> the next puzzle is a url that redirects to suggesting more puzzles
03:53:25 <Camail> https://www.humblebundle.com/freedom
03:53:39 <Camail> I might have to get this
03:53:44 <Camail> i have a decent number of these
03:53:51 <Camail> but they could be good gifts
03:54:14 <Camail> I..I dont want to learn R
03:54:21 <Camail> this humble bundle is fucking weird
03:55:32 <Camail> eh...I actually only want like 2 of those things nvm
03:56:06 <DuB`> Stardew!
03:56:25 <ZK> yeaaaaa
03:56:28 <ZK> thats pretty much it
03:56:33 <DuB`> Heh
03:56:40 <Camail> meat boy is good, invisible inc is good
03:56:55 <DuB`> Have meatboy from an old humble bundle.
03:57:00 <DuB`> Haven't heard of much else in there.
03:57:37 <Camail> It's a good thing if you already wanted to donate
03:57:57 <Camail> mini metro is good, I wanted that game

19:11:13 <Dot`> see, phone is dumb
19:11:28 <Dot`> skram
19:15:34 <reification> maybe you should have gotten a smartphone dot :p
19:15:42 <Dot`> good idea
19:26:26 <ZK> my TvT is becoming half decent
19:26:46 <ZK> my ZvZ is atrocious
19:27:03 <ZK> i have a 0% win rate vs protoss
19:27:05 <ZK> so that aint good
19:30:09 <skram> Hey dudes.
19:30:17 <ZK> hi skram
19:30:33 <Zounds> skram
19:30:37 <reification> hej skramannen
19:35:01 <Bio> skrm
19:35:08 <Bio> i'm doing it agian
19:35:14 <Bio> i'm reading up on mass effect
19:35:20 <Bio> re sailing old ships
19:35:25 <Bio> I dun wanna be dissapoint
19:35:36 <Phearlock> Gonna have to make new ships soon.
19:35:44 <Phearlock> hopefully =3
19:35:49 <skram> far as i understand none of the old dudes will be present in the new one
19:36:02 <Phearlock> Yeah
19:36:27 <skram> which is either a bold move or laziness? dunno
19:37:43 <Bio> I guess the story is that they were shipped off in cryosleep and arrive 600 ish years after the events of the original trilogy
19:37:52 <Phearlock> Yup
19:37:52 <Bio> or something
19:38:11 <skram> but like
19:38:24 <skram> they arrive in a completely different universe that is unconnected to the old one?
19:38:33 <Phearlock> Yes the andromeda galaxy
19:38:40 <Phearlock> 500 years of FTL
19:38:49 <Phearlock> or something
19:39:17 <Phearlock> And it's like most of the council races sent their own ships etc?
19:39:31 <Phearlock> So you end up with like budding factions of some of the old races there.
19:39:44 <Phearlock> And hopefully some new aliens as well
19:41:09 <ZK> holyyyyyyy shit
19:41:12 <ZK> i beat a masters player

20:29:22 <skram> wrong
20:29:23 <skram> its awful

20:32:31 <reification> .wiki japanese amberjack
20:33:02 <skram> I will take your word for it, DuB`.
20:33:13 <DuB`> Hard to beat tuna and salmon, though.
20:34:06 <skram> salmon is neat
20:34:16 <skram> never really had tuna though
20:34:19 <reification> i had salmon today, it was good
20:34:24 <DuB`> ?????????????????
20:34:26 <DuB`> NO TUNA?
20:34:27 <skram> except for canned tuna which is freakin vile
20:34:33 <Zounds> I'm a tuna fan
20:34:35 <DuB`> fffffffff
20:34:37 <Zounds> Salmon not really
20:34:37 <reification> wow skram

20:35:33 <DuB`> http://www.origamirestaurant.com/sushi2/images/sushi_maguro.jpg
20:35:36 <skram> Its not a thing we eat where I live ok??
20:35:38 <DuB`> ENGLISH
20:36:06 <skram> Its all potatoes and things made out of pigs
20:36:41 <DuB`> Psh.
20:37:28 <skram> And we only eat freshwater fish because the ocean IS LIKE SO FAR AWAY.
20:37:44 <skram> several HOURS
20:37:48 <Zounds> We eat a lot of cod and haddock here
20:38:03 <Zounds> Though we fry it in batter and make it all super unhealthy
20:38:46 <skram> Thats the best way, Zounds.
20:39:10 <Zounds> Yes it's quite delicious
20:39:32 <Dot`> is that a fox dub?
20:39:42 <reification> in scotland everything gets deep fried :p
20:39:49 <DuB`> Is what a fox, Dot`?
20:39:58 <Dot`> the pic you linked
20:40:07 <DuB`> That is a sushi.
20:40:10 <skram> We dont do any of that here of course. Norwegian cuisine is always bland and depressive
20:40:47 <skram> Boiled fish with potatoes. If its a special occasion you eat some carrots too.
20:41:02 <skram> And if you been a real good boy you might even use some salt
20:41:03 <DuB`> Needs more hamburgers.
20:41:29 <Zounds> I've seen british cuisine get quite a negative reputation in some media but I quite enjoy it
20:41:35 <Zounds> probably because i'm british
20:42:21 <reification> it‚Äôs just french propoganda zounds

20:46:31 <Zounds> There's one in pennsylvania
20:47:20 <DuB`> Perfect.
