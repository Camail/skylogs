00:19:16 <Camail> eh...I don't like akku =/ really takes the stakes out of the show
00:19:34 <Camail> neat new character design
00:19:45 <Camail> but the quality of this episode depends entirely on the finale
00:22:42 <Dot`> im hoping the gardian turns up
00:24:33 <Dot`> and its been shown jack can beat akku multiple times, plus jack has been training pretty much for 50 years more now
00:27:14 <Camail> but in this series jack is shit compared to akku
00:27:28 <Camail> there's no tension at all
00:28:00 <Camail> also jack hasn't used his sword for 50 years

01:01:42 <Camail> ok so fun fact
01:01:59 <Camail> turns out at level 64, using light armor, on the lowest difficulty
01:02:04 <Camail> this boss still one shots you
01:02:15 <Camail> witcher 3 is SUPER not scaled correctly for ng+
01:02:38 <Camail> because max difficulty is literally the same as lowest difficulty, with each shot doing at least 12k damage

21:19:41 <Phearlock_> hi
21:19:48 <Phearlock_> sorry turned on computer then left =P
21:28:24 <Camail> so rampage jackson, the mma fighter, streams on twitch
21:28:55 <Camail> probably meh, but thats so weird, just the concept
21:30:16 <Dot`> it does feel weird when someone relativly well known streams games
21:36:04 <Camail> him and deadmau5 are probably the most famous
21:40:52 <Dot`> yea, that was the guy.
21:41:29 <Bio> asdf

22:42:59 <DuB`> I am watching the Bob Ross of Bonsai, but I do need to do those.
22:43:00 <DuB`> :P
22:44:24 <Micen_> my dogs think computer time is lay in my lap time
22:44:44 <Phearlock_> It isn't?
22:45:27 <Micen_> they never do this
22:45:31 <DuB`> I feel like if it's just me and micen the mmr will be too high for me...
22:45:36 <DuB`> We need some more noobs.
22:45:42 <Micen_> and one of them is too large to be lap dog
22:45:48 <Micen_> pls dub.
22:45:55 <Micen_> i can coach you to be good
22:46:11 <Micen_> if you pay attention and do objectives you are above 50th precentile
22:46:17 <DuB`> I dun want coaching - I just wanna get through 5 games. :D
22:46:38 <DuB`> Still can't be against AI?

23:36:00 <Crisium> amazing ASL games today btw, DuB`
23:36:07 <Crisium> totally recommend watching the series
23:36:19 <DuB`> Ooh!
23:36:23 <DuB`> Who? 
23:36:24 <Micen_> who was playing?
23:36:24 <Crisium> https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk3uDIjF_B0
23:36:26 <DuB`> So I can find
23:36:27 <DuB`> Ah
23:36:28 <DuB`> tyty
23:36:33 <Crisium> Mong vs Shine
23:36:41 <Crisium> trust me even if you dont recognzie them, its top notch stuff
23:36:46 <DuB`> Sounds good
23:39:38 <Dot`> they were nice games
23:39:40 <Micen_> damn there are two ways i want the other side of the bracket to go
23:39:51 <Micen_> I really want Soulkey vs Flash
23:40:23 <Micen_> but the idea of a Tastosis casting a series with Best vs Last seems like it would lead to some great commentary.
