00:55:46 <Camail> pls
01:37:32 <Camail> dub wanna gigantic
01:37:44 <Camail> also i looked at reddit and boy do people like complaining about tripp
01:37:49 <Camail> kinda funny
01:39:02 <DuB`> O
01:39:05 <DuB`> Naw, doin' reading.
01:39:15 <DuB`> Tripp is bad tho!? :P
01:49:07 <DuB`> Margrave would be more fun if he weren't so buggy...
02:05:49 <Camail> yea i notice with griselma somtimes the hands dont go where i think they are going
02:06:17 <Camail> i dont play any other heroes with skills that interact with the geometry so its the only time i delt with it
02:08:01 <DuB`> The worst cases are when the leapstuns just get rubberbanded backwards or bump into the ground wrong and just get cancelled
02:08:20 <DuB`> And when the charge gets stuck on a tiny brick or step for 80% of its duration...
02:08:44 <DuB`> It gets stuck on DOWNWARD slopes!
02:11:32 <Camail> have you considered gitting gud

03:17:16 <Camail> bio why did gigantic never interest you?
03:17:48 <ZK> Are you guys still playing?
03:18:01 <Camail> yea
03:18:19 <ZK> cool cool
03:19:21 <Camail> tho the game is gonna die because apparently they split the community between pc and xbox/windows 10
03:20:00 <ZK> windows 10 is different from pc?
03:20:51 <Camail> yea, because microsoft
03:21:02 <Camail> well, fromt he microsoft store specifically
03:21:15 <Camail> thats why we all have to go through the arc player thing
03:21:21 <Camail> instead of just going straight through steam
03:21:51 <ZK> that sucks
03:30:37 <DuB`> Does feel nice actually adulting and being productive now that summer is over. :P
03:30:43 <DuB`> I lazed HARD for 3 months, haha
03:34:50 <ZK> YAY

19:34:39 <Zounds> no rush
19:35:43 <Zounds> i've been playing some deathmatch in overwatch
19:36:02 <Zounds> It would seem I'm a god
19:36:38 <Zounds> Though I've been playing McCree and he's kinda tailor made for that gamemode
19:37:46 <Camail> sandwich complete
19:40:28 <Zounds> bit of a fragile team comp but whatevs
19:40:41 <Zounds> we'll give them a headache hopefully
20:05:31 <Camail> we needed to 100% commit to that last fight
20:05:32 <Camail> but we didnt
20:05:37 <Zounds> yes
20:05:38 <Camail> because people dont understand how energy works
20:05:45 <Zounds> one more hit and the charnok would've died
20:05:49 <Zounds> could've dived him easily
20:05:59 <Camail> i dove more thna our flankers
20:06:32 <Camail> also god damn is griselma good against creatures
20:06:49 <Zounds> indeed

20:07:07 <Camail> it just stood there and did nothing wihle i killed it
20:07:25 <Zounds> Trying to get imani level 5
20:07:43 <Zounds> I wasn't missing much in that last game
20:07:50 <Camail> the only two fights we won in that game were th eones where you could get shots off
20:08:06 <Camail> middle pre clash, then c after i killed the cyclops
20:08:24 <Camail> griselma is soooooooo slow tho

20:48:08 <Phearlock> Aw
21:06:08 <Zounds> That'll do me for now cam
21:06:10 <Zounds> thanks for the games
21:06:11 <Camail> i like how as soon as i started trolling the xenobia he focused puirely on flaming me
21:06:28 <Zounds> I dunno if that was trolling
21:06:34 <Zounds> looked like typical internet bickering
21:06:49 <Camail> i was baiting him into being angry by acting smug
21:06:57 <Zounds> The kind seen in a thousand online matches in a thousand online games
21:07:13 <Camail> i didnt insult him once
21:07:15 <Camail> so there's that
21:07:23 <Camail> you just seem to be mad that i have any negative emotions at all
21:07:34 <Zounds> Not at all man
21:07:36 <Camail> all i did was poke at him
21:07:44 <Zounds> It was the most entertaining thing in the match
21:07:52 <Camail> because he was already at 5 deaths and we wren't gonna win
21:08:23 <Camail> but instead of talking about the entire team he decided to insult me
21:08:35 <Zounds> You were tanking even in chat then
21:08:36 <Zounds> heh
21:08:52 <Zounds> I may aswell have not existed in that match
21:08:56 <Camail> nah it was even more destructive
21:08:57 <Zounds> not much for sven to assist with there
