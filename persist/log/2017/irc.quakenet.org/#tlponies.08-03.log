00:06:08 <DoT`> dub dub
00:06:37 <DoT`> rawr, whats up
00:08:06 <Camail> is dub still napping
00:10:10 <DoT`> probably
00:15:58 <DuB`> wuh
00:16:08 <DuB`> Can't be napping now, bedtime is in an hour or two. :P
00:17:22 <Camail> did you have a long nap
00:17:26 <Camail> was your head wet
00:17:37 <DoT`> need to nap so you are reay for main sleep
00:17:56 <Camail> naps are just practice for sleeping
00:18:09 <Camail> dot is bad at sleeping cuz he doesn't nap enough
00:18:24 <DoT`> i wonder if we could tie the scarf around someone so they didnt notice, then use find object to follow them
00:18:28 <DuB`> Aha
00:18:49 <DoT`> though its probably easier to just slip a coin in thier pocket
00:18:55 <DoT`> but we need a use for the scarf
00:19:46 <Camail> or just find object on something they are already carrying
00:22:02 <DoT`> the spell does say "something you are familier with" i am not sure how familier that really means
00:26:20 <DoT`> rawr http://imgur.com/gallery/BTCT2
00:46:34 <Camail> you just have to have seen in and stuff like that
00:46:45 <Camail> cant do like "cast find object on the hidden treasure"
00:52:24 <Camail> oh also
00:52:31 <Camail> we should try the new game gigantic
00:53:09 <Camail> I've been vaguely aware of it for awhile now cuz an artist i follow worked on it, doing a lot of the character portraits
00:53:25 <DuB`> sURE
00:53:27 <Camail> it looks interesting, is free, and is pretty
00:53:28 <DuB`> Sure
00:53:32 <Camail> sUrE
01:18:51 <DuB`> DL'ed and installed.
01:30:22 <Camail> omg i might have to revert drivers

20:28:25 <Phearlock> I like pony science
20:28:36 <Phearlock> now he should do the same with the fimfiction archive dump
20:29:06 <Dot`> lol
20:29:31 <Dot`> even a program may go mad if made to go through all that bad writing
20:43:16 <ZK> fimfiction is great writing!
20:43:22 <ZK> i rememebr liking like 2 stories
20:44:54 <Dot`> the 2 you wrote?
20:48:04 <ZK> those are good too, never put htem on fimficiotn tho
20:48:28 <Phearlock> fimfiction is still the best fanfiction site I've seen
20:49:28 <Phearlock> Easy to search through, the group function helps in letting people find collections of similar stories.
20:50:39 <ZK> oh yea, its excellent
