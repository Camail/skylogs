04:40:52 <motbob> for example, I call my aunts "Aunt [first name]"
04:41:13 <motbob> for the purposes of this survey, please say what you called them in high school. Uncles are OK too.
04:47:26 <DuB`> "Aunt first name" when referring to them, or just their first name when speaking directly to them, motbob.

06:27:12 <Micen> so i found out that no subreddit exists for something
06:27:34 <Micen> there is no subreddit for the hobby of people watching. 
06:35:13 <motbob> i think there was something like that
06:36:06 <motbob> or more accurately, I think the hobby of people-watching is too linked with watching fat people specifically
06:36:15 <motbob> which is banned on reddit
06:36:31 <Micen> that could be it.
