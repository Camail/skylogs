16:53:52 <DuB`> DOOOT
16:53:53 <DuB`> <3
16:55:46 <Dot`> have i been playing lucio all wrong dub? im i suppose to have changed jump to right click?
16:56:34 <Zounds> That would be like tribes!
16:56:52 <DuB`> Apparently.
16:57:05 <DuB`> If you wanna be DSPstanky.
16:57:22 <Zounds> at least I had jump on right click in tribes I can't actually remember if it's default
16:57:33 <Dot`> why didnt you say something dub...
17:03:44 <Zounds> Why would the button config change anything though
17:03:51 <Zounds> Isn't it just preference
17:10:17 <Dot`> well if i relate it to my old kickboxing, people have a natural prefrance to throw haymakers, but even a mediocre trained straight punch is normaly better
17:10:39 <Dot`> but as i havnt played with right mouse i cant tell yet if its just prefrance
17:11:03 <Dot`> or soemthing that while diffrent at first is better once your use to it
17:12:08 <DuB`> It's...
17:12:12 <DuB`> It's beautiful.
17:12:13 <DuB`> https://gfycat.com/HardAppropriateArieltoucan
17:12:19 <DuB`> Perhaps the most beautiful thing I've seen.
17:12:48 <Dot`> i hate genji
17:13:18 <DuB`> Rude.
17:13:46 <Dot`> pretty much
17:13:51 <Zounds> right click to jump is kinda old fashioned
17:15:05 <Runbunny> Perfect genji, miss all shot, get a random lucky deflect, be proud of your performance.
17:15:05 <Zounds> not to say it's any worse than space though :P
17:16:22 <Zounds> I wonder if console genji is any good
17:16:32 <Zounds> He's such a mixture of crazy movement yet totally forgiving attacks
17:17:25 <Zounds> I feel for my console mccree friends
17:22:44 <DuB`> Being able to flick-180 turn on genji is so important, I feel like playing him on console would be bizzare.
17:23:12 <DuB`> *Dash* ... "Hold on, could you wait for 3 second while I turn around again?"
17:24:48 <Zounds> The guy you're dashing behind does the same thing though

21:09:41 <Dot`> maybe sometimes
21:09:52 <Yolteotl> then you will cry so much
21:10:14 <reification> wow are you that bad to watch films with :p
21:10:32 <Yolteotl> ahahah
21:10:45 <Yolteotl> nop, but there are some movies than are sooo :'( :'(
21:10:52 <Dot`> he is frnech
21:11:10 <Yolteotl> I just re-watched "the girl who leapt through time"
21:11:25 <Yolteotl> I'm liking Mamoru Hosada so much :D
21:11:37 <reification> they are rather emotional dot. no stiff upper lip and all that :p
21:12:15 <Dot`> .tell skram WHERE YOU
21:12:52 <reification> i haven’t watched a makoto shinkai film since 5cm/s
21:12:58 <reification> i should prob catch up
21:13:08 <Yolteotl> but, but, reif, I'm sure your theater are showing "Kimi no Na wa"/"Your name" : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRfHcp2GjVI
21:13:50 <Yolteotl> To be honest, Shinkai was always great on technical side, and now, it is also awesome on the story :D
21:14:02 <Yolteotl> *he is
21:14:32 <reification> oh that’s interesting. i certainly remember him being one to watch for the animation over storytelling
21:14:39 <motbob> i thought all his movies were real bad
21:14:46 <motbob> but I havn't seen the new one
21:14:54 <Yolteotl> He needs still one or two more movies at this level to confirm, but it's already great to have one movie like this one
21:15:20 <reification> if you thought they were bad why keep watching them motbob?
21:15:29 <Yolteotl> He just destroyed japan box office, with 16 millions tickets sold o_o
21:16:01 <reification> no showing nearer than london in a fortnight yolo
21:16:06 <Yolteotl> D:
21:16:07 <Yolteotl> D:
21:16:12 <Yolteotl> your country is BAD
21:16:24 <motbob> people keep recommending them
21:17:23 <reification> well at least you’ve learned whose taste doesn’t match yours
21:17:38 <motbob> people have said that his movies use themes that have deep ties to aspects of jp culture
21:17:54 <motbob> i am probably just too thick to understand
21:18:31 <Yolteotl> no motbob, I agree with you, the background was almost always boring with Shinkai
21:19:14 <Yolteotl> I did not finish "Children Who Chase Lost Voices" :D
21:19:16 <reification> noh has deeo ties to japanese culture but i’m not sitting through that…
21:19:22 <reification> *deep
21:20:06 <reification> http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/hiring-metrics
21:22:55 <Yolteotl> In Bordeaux, I can watch it in 2 theaters (probably 3 / 4 next week) with both showing it in french or japanese
21:22:56 <reification> oh i remember ouran mot, quite entertaining for shoujo iirc
21:24:01 <Yolteotl> France best country :P
21:24:13 <reification> ah, france has more of a culture for this kind of thing…
21:24:46 <Yolteotl> eeyup
21:25:36 <Yolteotl> Do you know which is the first country, after Japan, as biggest manga market ?  :P
21:26:00 <motbob> fucking french
21:26:10 <Yolteotl> :D
21:26:11 <motbob> they buy all the official naimation books released by studios
21:26:17 <motbob> and drive up the price for everyone else
21:26:21 <Bio> M I S T A K E
21:27:04 <motbob> is there a french fansubbing scene or does everyone watch in english
21:27:45 <Dot`> http://imgur.com/gallery/qmdCYLq
21:27:50 <Yolteotl> english sub or english dub ?  :P
21:28:00 <motbob> either i guess
21:28:10 <motbob> are there good french dubs for that matter?
21:28:31 <Yolteotl> It depends, some can be really great
21:28:50 <Yolteotl> for normal movies, almost everyone watch them in french
21:29:16 <Yolteotl> The Simpsons and South Park are better in french than in english
21:29:43 <reification> sure i’ve seen plenty of vostfr tags going around
21:29:44 <motbob> oh, for mainstream stuff like that, I'd imagine so
21:30:50 <Yolteotl> for anime, I like some of them, because I'm still not used to japan voices D:
21:31:05 <Yolteotl> and I have to read every line of sub, it's disturbing...
21:32:12 <motbob> the new one piece film came out yesterday and it's already subbed in French...
21:32:34 <motbob> no, wait, this is the prologue to the movie (?)
21:32:51 <motbob> champagnesubs
21:32:56 <Yolteotl> but yes, I think since we have lot of fans of japan culture
21:33:09 <Yolteotl> and lot of ppl who doesn't speak english
21:33:22 <Yolteotl> there is probably a huge sub community
21:33:45 <Yolteotl> I know there is a TV channel, called J1, showing some japan animes in Day+1
21:35:34 <Yolteotl> all that to say that I want to re-watch Kimi no na wa u_u

22:59:44 <skram> I dont know Dot`
22:59:58 <Dot`> cam, if you want to start one soon i can play, but i cant much later as i have to actually get up by 8 tomorow
23:00:37 <Camail> meh we can try some other day, don't wanna force anyone
23:01:00 <Camail> we can probably play vanilla pandemic maybe 2 more times before adding in expansions
23:01:15 <Camail> but then i gotta make 100% sure the expansions were added right
23:02:26 <skram> I can play like every other week
23:02:41 <skram> the other week i gotta go to bed at DuB`-times
23:03:26 <Camail> we can always start earlier than we did
23:03:35 <Camail> my sleep schedule is becoming normal
23:04:15 <Dot`> so you cant play today skram?
23:04:47 <skram> id rather not
23:04:49 <skram> hurts to talk
23:05:08 <Dot`> ok, np
23:05:42 <Camail> so many problems
23:06:00 <Camail> it was fun though, good potential for more stacking in the future
23:06:10 <Camail> and it will always be there for other's to buy during sales
23:06:51 <Dot`> yea dub
23:06:59 <skram> ya i agree

23:21:49 <Dot`> Skram, there is a highly rated board game called caverna: the cave farmers, you play as a bearded dwarf farmer
23:21:49 <Dot`> haha
23:22:20 <skram> well we decided what to do for next session
23:24:06 <Yolteotl> We offered caverna to a friend for her birthday 2 months ago :D
23:24:30 <skram> You're a good friend yolt
23:25:19 <Dot`> yolt, we only played last night and that was pandemic and love letter(?) i tihnk it was called
23:26:03 <Yolteotl> pandemic, or pandemic legacy ?  :D
23:26:29 <Dot`> just pandemic
23:27:38 <Yolteotl> ok! pandemic legacy is the same, but with a campaign mode
23:27:46 <Dot`> will probably add expansions next time, se ehow it goes
23:27:50 <Yolteotl> so every game you do impact the next one
23:28:01 <Dot`> yee, got to learn to play first
23:28:09 <Yolteotl> it's really fun :)

23:37:56 <Dot`> <3
23:38:07 <Yolteotl> yes!
23:38:15 <Yolteotl> and you have to do the best one
23:43:17 <motbob> hey guys I have an english creative writing question
23:44:00 <motbob> this show I'm working on is an anime about a girl who crossdresses to work a man's job
23:44:43 <motbob> at the end of episode 1, she says, "Oh, I know! I'l use "ore" from now on."
23:45:00 <motbob> where "ore" is a japanese first person pronoun used by men
23:45:21 <motbob> i am wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to translate this to english 
23:45:30 <Dot`> DuB`
23:46:09 <Dot`> he is in OW atm but will probably awnser when the round finishes
23:48:51 <motbob> it's OK to make some shit up instead of a direct translation, it just has to have the same general meaning (like, shes gonna start using a masculine term in her everyday speech)
