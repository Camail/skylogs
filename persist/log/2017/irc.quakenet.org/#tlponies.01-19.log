17:10:14 <Dot`> who can we get to replace our grumpy swede
17:10:44 <Camail_Phone> I dunno just punch runbunny a few times?
17:11:07 <Dot`> replacing the danish weeb may be more tricky
17:11:28 <Camail_Phone> We dont need one of those
17:11:32 <Runbunny> Why would you punch me Camail?
17:11:42 <Camail_Phone> To make you grumpy obv
17:12:28 <Phearlock> Anyway, alien killing rookie losing hype!
17:12:35 <Dot`> !!!
17:12:44 <Dot`> phear stream?
17:12:49 <Runbunny> Where is the D.Va skin Dot?
17:12:58 <Phearlock> I can if you want. Steam streem or twitchstreem?
17:13:04 <Camail_Phone> Did new skins come out
17:13:06 <Dot`> twitch
17:13:12 <Dot`> soon cam
17:13:22 <Camail_Phone> Which event this time
17:13:25 <Dot`> i shall open the link runbun and scroll down
17:13:31 <Dot`> then cop paste the image for you
17:13:32 <Camail_Phone> Black history month?
17:13:43 <Runbunny> oh lel.
17:13:43 <Dot`> https://twitter.com/OverwatchKR/status/821900050573860865
17:13:47 <Runbunny> I found it.
17:13:51 <Runbunny> Just before you :D
17:13:56 <Runbunny> Thanks Dot.
17:15:00 <Dot`> phear, do i still use like the evac all mod and the one that stops all the unnecasary waits?
17:15:07 <Dot`> or do i JUST run long war
17:15:58 <Dot`> im guessing all the other long war mods are included so dont need to be ticked
17:17:38 <Phearlock> The stuff that just messes with base game mechanics like pauses should be fine.
17:17:43 <Phearlock> Maps and sounds should be fine
17:18:08 <Phearlock> Anything that changes the strategic or tactical layer content-wise is probably incompatible until people can get compatibility stuff released
17:18:12 <Phearlock> https://www.twitch.tv/phearlock anyway
