01:49:36 <Bio> I'll most likely have a character, yeh
01:49:52 <Bio> lvl mage to 60, sit in org selling ports
02:21:51 <Camail> skram no
02:34:44 <Camail> i had a bug in my app, and nothing fixed it, so i painstakingly put breakpoints one at a time at crucial points, and then it worked
02:34:51 <Camail> like my debugging collapsed the wave function
02:35:03 <Camail> and it decided to work because i was observing it
02:38:02 <Bio> noice
03:10:49 <skrm> CAMAIL YES
03:10:55 <Camail> no
03:38:56 <Bio> you ever played factorio cam
03:39:12 <Camail> i have
03:40:05 <Bio> is pretty fun
03:40:17 <Camail> got decently far but i didn't use any blueprints so it was very messy and couldnt sustain itself once i needed the last 2 sciences
03:40:45 <Camail> i made a nuclear reactor but never quite got around to using it
03:40:47 <Bio> thats what i'm finding
03:41:17 <Bio> its definitely one of those play a bunch of times and learn/practice something new each time

04:08:33 <Camail> ultimately you need a really strong infrastructure for iron and copper ore mining, transportation, and processing
04:08:55 <Camail> mine was pretty haphazard
04:09:46 <Camail> especially if you dont have a good transition from direct coal power to electrical power
04:09:56 <Camail> that was the beginning of the ugly pile
04:12:36 <Bio> I haven't made it to electric furnaces yet
04:13:06 <Bio> I wanna build robits
04:13:10 <Bio> sky robits
04:13:54 <Camail> drones replacing transportation is like super lategame
04:14:01 <Camail> you need soooo many to make it worth it
04:14:18 <Camail> i dumped a lot of resources into getting like 40 and it was awful
04:15:01 <Camail> i didnt use electric furnaces much, but you get those way later than you get electricity for everything else
