00:24:13 <Dot`> micen
00:24:16 <Dot`> you watch pony yet
00:31:44 <Camail> I should write a one shot
00:32:18 <Camail> but its so railroady
00:32:40 <Dot`> do it
00:32:41 <Camail> the only elegant way is to in medias res
00:32:43 <Dot`> see how it goes
00:33:02 <Camail> the problem is the effort to pay off ratio
00:33:06 <Dot`> or run a westmarches, ALL the one shots
00:34:14 <Camail> is it weird that i think a hollow knight dnd campaign would be cool
00:34:28 <Camail> probably during the five knights era
00:34:41 <Camail> or maybe pre-wyrm
00:34:46 <Camail> who knows! there's actually a lot there
00:34:56 <Camail> also everything would be bugs
00:37:06 <Dot`> BUUUGS
00:37:09 <Dot`> they are pretty cute
00:37:26 <Camail> sadly thats way to much reworking for a one shot
00:38:02 <Camail> Mildly interested in doing just a romp in Waterdeep, had fun writing that one
00:38:18 <Camail> its just a City with Shady People with a Name
00:38:37 <Camail> also, samurai jack was good
00:39:04 <Dot`> will be watchign sooon
00:39:17 <Camail> its moving FAST
00:39:29 <Camail> but i guess it needs to, probably a short season
