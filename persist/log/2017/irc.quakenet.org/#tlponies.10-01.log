20:44:38 <Camail> dot why is spain so fucked
20:44:49 <reification> it‚Äôs full of spanish ppl
20:45:27 <reification> they are prone to being very pasionate
20:45:35 <reification> i.e. crazy and angry
20:45:37 <Camail> thats the whole problem reif
20:45:43 <Camail> many of them dont think they are spanish people
20:45:49 <Camail> thats kinda the critical issue
20:47:29 <Dot`> cam, important question, how good is ep 109, the live show
20:47:48 <Dot`> the start has a guy i hat eon site and he keeps shouting then whispering
20:48:02 <Camail> i think thats when the big story beat happens
20:48:08 <reification> i can confirm they are all spanish cam
20:48:17 <Camail> why you gotta hate on brian, dot
20:48:29 <reification> abeit some with extra arrogance and historical delusions of grandeur
20:48:29 <Dot`> he is easly hateable?
20:48:55 <Camail> have you ever watched talks machina?
20:48:56 <Dot`> and cam, spain is in the southern hemisphere
20:49:03 <Dot`> no cam, i have not
20:49:06 <reification> also independence movements in spain are tainted from ETA which add to the drama
20:49:10 <Camail> he's the host, he's not bad
20:49:19 <Camail> he's just really hype so it comes off as a frat bro kinda vibe
20:49:47 <Camail> also you can just skip that he's gone after 3 minutes
20:52:02 <Dot`> and in regards to spain,  things get more violant the further south you go on the globe
20:55:29 <reification> well antarctica is quite peaceful dot‚Ä¶
20:56:19 <Camail> or maybe they all died hundreds of years ago
20:56:24 <Dot`> have you seen polar bears and killer whales?
20:56:24 <Camail> because it was so violent
20:56:31 <Camail> polar bears are north
20:56:35 <Camail> penguins are south
20:56:42 <Dot`> pengiuns are even worse!
20:56:46 <Camail> veru true
20:56:47 <Dot`> they reek

23:14:25 <Camail> sweetie controls too many of your life decisions
23:14:42 <Camail> and she never tells you to play videogames
23:14:45 <Camail> which is a problem
23:14:58 <DuB`> I played lots this weekend!
23:15:16 <Camail> only games, forever
23:15:38 <DuB`> Won a bunch of fortnite games with irl friend and brother too.
23:15:50 <DuB`> (Said friends aren't great at games. :P)
23:16:10 <Camail> even though i dont super like the game, we should still tlpstack it
23:19:34 <DuB`> It's mostly fun because a lot of really bad gamers play it, haha
23:19:39 <DuB`> So it's kinda chill-easy.
