00:59:15 <Cane> Wow, I forgot this tune was turned into a rap.
00:59:32 <Cane> Love that movie btw.
00:59:54 <Cane> I can think of few things more Norwegian than Fl√•klypa Grand Prix.
01:00:14 <skram> agreed
01:00:59 <Cane> It's almost like our culture's Wizard Of Oz.
01:01:14 <Cane> I still have a model version of the Il Tempo Gigante on my shelf.
01:01:23 <Cane> Mostly broken down, with bits missing, but still there.
01:01:45 <Cane> Wish I could get a like-new version.
01:02:20 <skram> There's a Il Tempo Gigante rollercoaster at Hunderfossen
01:02:34 <Cane> Have you ever seen the full size road legal version?
01:02:38 <skram> I tried stealing my nephew so I could go
01:02:47 <skram> Yeah, that is exhibited there as well
01:03:03 <Cane> I'd love to see it when they take it out on the road. Happens every once in a while.
01:03:56 <skram> Yeah, me too
01:04:13 <skram> too bad they're not allowed to use the turbine engine though :p
