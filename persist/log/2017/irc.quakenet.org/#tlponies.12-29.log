02:23:51 <micen> Hello
02:24:21 <skrm> hey micen
02:24:27 <skrm> how's your christmas been
02:38:08 <micen> its been good 
02:38:12 <micen> im setting something up
02:38:42 <CockRoach|42> the bomb?
02:40:42 <Camail> got my 13 year old steam account back
02:40:47 <Camail> doesnt mean much
02:40:56 <Camail> but tis more for sentimental reasons
02:42:35 <micen> how low is the digit count?
02:43:08 <micen> if its a 4 or 5 digit steam account you might be able to sell it for big bucks. 
02:45:01 <Camail> I never intended to sell it, especially because hackers are th eonly buyers
02:45:09 <Camail> but also its early 7's
02:45:23 <micen> i know my brother is thinking about selling his 4 digit account
02:45:38 <Camail> account was made august 2004, so 11 months after steam was established
02:46:51 <micen> ahh, yeah. 
02:48:07 <Camail> but really that couldn't be further from the point, for me
02:48:20 <Camail> lots of childhood memories tied to that account
02:48:55 <Camail> on an unrelated note wihle i was searching for steam stats i found out that my main account has 7k hours of games played since i made it
02:49:09 <Camail> so much gaming
03:21:55 <DuB`> Wew
03:21:58 <DuB`> Cam, stopped at lv7
03:22:07 <DuB`> Good stuff
03:36:21 <Camail> cool
03:36:31 <Camail> i can play again, if you want to, but you have a thing to go to
03:36:41 <Camail> I'm free for the rest of the night
03:37:11 <Camail> had to play sf5 with mah brother, he needs to be beaten regularly or he might forget he's bad
03:42:12 <Camail> glad you enjoy it, tho. will be fun to continue stacking
03:42:50 <Camail> Dot`_  wanna play tomorrow? I'll wake up at a normal time
03:50:19 <micen> twitch.tv/micenfarock

06:11:53 <DuB`> About to hit lv8 and max out my trial lol
06:12:17 <DuB`> And I still really want to play more, which I guess means it deserves my $20
06:14:16 <Camail> if you buy it you dont have to stop
06:14:39 <Camail> its pretty seemles

06:49:05 <DuB`> I want ALL the medical wing perk upgrades!
06:50:30 <DuB`> Do you have to reinstall after buy or just play off of trial launcher, Camail?
06:50:41 <Camail> its all there
06:50:54 <Camail> there was a small isntall for me cuz i got some extra stuff
06:50:58 <Camail> but it was 100 mb
06:51:18 <Camail> so it doesnt have to download any game content
06:57:05 <DuB`> "Rogue Agents Killed" being a main stat displayed right in the uplay laucher feels kinda spoiler-y.
06:57:42 -!- skram [~skram@109.203.11.251] has joined #tlponies
06:58:11 <Camail> well, its the pvp mechanic, that's pretty much it
06:58:15 <Camail> dunno how it factors into the story
06:58:27 <Camail> but i think it's relatively segregated 
06:59:15 <DuB`> Oh, pvp?
06:59:20 <DuB`> Huh, nvm then
07:08:51 <Camail> yea going rogue can only be done in the dark zone
07:09:18 <Camail> which is the place where you go to get the good stuff you need to identify, and you can get ganked, but then those people turn into rogues
07:09:37 <Camail> its a neat system where once you turn on PvP you can shoot anyone, but they can all attack you
07:10:54 <Camail> everyone in the DZ gets along until somebody dies, then tensions explode
07:12:38 <DuB`> I just remembered in the opening cutscenes them mentioning that previous SHD agents had gone MIA, thought "rogue" was spoilering what happened to some
07:12:49 <Camail> nope

20:48:10 <Camail> yea i crafted a blue SVD but i need to be lvl 12
20:48:12 <Camail> cant wait
20:48:16 <DuB`> Blue is nice

20:48:46 <DuB`> Oke later
20:49:03 <Camail> cya
20:54:10 <Camail> micen  supposedly 1.8 was a big patch, so the game has changed a bit since launch
20:54:29 <Camail> dark zones are less cancerous because rogue is a toggle now instead of just a player damage threshold
