11:14:11 <Zounds> I've been adjusting my sensitivity for years, it's an ongoing process
11:14:33 <Zounds> 1600dpi with 1.80 in Overwatch settings atm
11:14:45 <Runbunny> I turned mine a bit down when I started playing a lot of cs
11:15:00 <Runbunny> but I have never bothered to figure out the actual numbers.
11:18:05 <Zounds> Yeah it depends on the game
11:18:48 <Zounds> There's a lot of close range fast moving targets in overwatch so going really really low is going to cause some problems unless you've got a mouse bungee or something
11:19:37 <Zounds> in a game like CS you've already done 90% of the aiming before someone even appears
11:22:47 <Zounds> Low sens was good for me in tribes ascend since I played sentinel half the time
11:22:57 <Zounds> fast, long range yet predictable dots to click on

19:36:44 <ZK> oh mask man, yea thats who
19:36:51 <Camail> the painte ris all about exploring new skills after mastering his life's goal
19:37:05 <Camail> the nailsmith wants to die because after mastering his life's skill he has nothing to live for
19:37:18 <Camail> if you dont kill him and force him to live on, he moves in with the nailmaster and adopts his life philosophy
19:37:23 <Camail> its really cool
19:37:26 <Camail> i killed him tho
19:37:28 <Camail> found that online
19:38:03 <Dot`> that is nice
19:38:07 <ZK> i just looked at mas maker, i remember unmasking him
19:38:08 <Camail> it's like, the only happy end to an npc storyline
19:38:19 <Camail> how did you unmask him?
19:38:24 <Camail> i never did anything with the mask maker
19:38:26 <ZK> i think donw attack
19:38:33 <Camail> ok dont tell me anymore
19:38:35 <Camail> gonna go do it

19:38:58 <ZK> map maker doesnt end happy?
19:39:01 <ZK> guess ill go see him
19:40:57 <Camail> oh right he's fine
19:41:29 <Camail> but its not as strong, there are certai things in other stroylines that you really want to happen
19:41:35 <Camail> and the exact opposite happens
