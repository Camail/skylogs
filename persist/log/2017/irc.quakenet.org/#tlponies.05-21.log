18:09:15 <Dot`> important question, is the word dregs really so uncommon that its ok for 3, 27+ year olds to not know it
18:10:16 <Phearlock> I think so?
18:10:33 <Rawr|Fone> Probably
18:11:06 <skram> no?
18:11:40 <Dot`> i thought it was a common word, then i used it on a comversation with 3 friends
18:11:44 <Dot`> none knew it...
18:11:54 <skram> are they native english speakers
18:11:58 <Dot`> yes
18:12:04 <Dot`> 2 south africans and a canadian
18:12:24 <skram> unacceptable
18:12:51 <CockRoach|42> i think it's quite a british word tho
18:13:26 <Dot`> i see it a fair bit though in books, form dregs of coffee, to dregs of society
18:15:37 <carcinisation> maybe you read older books https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=dregs&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cdregs%3B%2Cc0

22:59:03 <DuB`> Still 2 more trees coming, too.
23:03:29 <reify> dub is abandoning accounting for horticulture
23:07:43 <Crisium> dub is applejack?
23:07:48 <Crisium> gotta farm celery
23:09:30 <DuB`> I don't think celery bonsai is a thing.
23:10:05 <Camail> terraria is fun, but i never build cool things, I'm always ruthlessly practical
23:10:34 <Camail> everyone gets a minimum sized rom, stacked on top of each other
23:10:39 <DuB`> I made a cool wizard tower!
23:10:48 <Camail> aint got time to build fancy houses for people that dont exist
23:10:53 <DuB`> But the NPCs just have a big ugly apartment block, yeah. :P
23:11:10 <DuB`> TENEMENTS
23:11:30 <Camail> i find making myself, and by extension my character, cooler to be more motivating for me
23:11:51 <Camail> that extends to everything I've ever done in any game ever
23:12:21 <Camail> did try and build a solid gold house but got bored really quickly

23:14:26 <DuB`> Him and the martian/snow/pumpkin event stuff.
23:14:29 <Camail> i build a railway to farm him
23:14:32 <Camail> was fun
23:14:46 <Camail> hand my cart doing jumps over him
23:14:51 <Camail> farming for the worms is annoying, tho
23:16:31 <DuB`> We have a nice big skyrail we could extend over the water.
23:16:45 <DuB`> Complete with a train station where it passes through my wizard tower!
23:20:03 <Camail> you do the 4 towers yet?
23:20:11 <Camail> EZ tier upgrade
23:20:41 <DuB`> Doesn't sound familiar, probly not.
