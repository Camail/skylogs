18:46:55 <skram> Way too hot
18:47:09 <skram> I had to do manual labor in the sun today
18:47:27 <Zounds> =(
18:49:23 <Zounds> I'll be sharing your pain tomorrow
18:49:32 <Zounds> no manual labour but large crowds for 10 hours
18:51:59 <skram> Whatcha doin
18:52:13 <Zounds> working at a music festival
18:52:22 <skram> ooh
18:52:53 <skram> that does not sound like much fun
18:53:26 <Zounds> sometimes it's not too bad but in this heat I think it will suck
18:54:48 <Dot`> zounds, that too long to be around ppl
18:55:00 <skram> not everyone is scared of people Dot` :p
18:55:13 <Dot`> not scared, just dislike
18:55:15 <Zounds> they're not people though they're attendees
18:55:18 <Zounds> or punters as we call them
18:56:23 <skram> fair enough :p
18:56:58 <Zounds> the bag searching is going to be a bottleneck probably
18:57:17 <Dot`> did you get a new bunch of security breifings zounds
18:58:12 <Zounds> I didn't but area managers did
18:58:18 <Zounds> all I got was an email :p
18:59:14 <Zounds> I like to think we're not nearly as incompetant as the guys in manchester but we'll see
18:59:43 <Zounds> the fact that guy hit after the concert was over resonates with the sorta relaxed atmosphere we often feel at the end

19:26:49 <DuB`> And got some a buncha helltsone.
19:26:53 <Camail> i assume you fight him underground now
19:26:55 <DuB`> Because bio OP lava waders ez.
19:27:10 <Camail> did you go into lava and let him kill himself?
19:27:22 <DuB`> Naw, fought aboveground.
19:27:42 <Camail> oh also if you really really wanna cheese it make a spawn house with the nurse in it
19:27:49 <Camail> infinite health
19:28:00 <Camail> makes every boss in the game way easier
19:28:06 <DuB`> Gotta fight skelly now.
19:28:09 <DuB`> He's hard.
19:28:19 <Camail> I'll log on for that
19:28:23 <DuB`> Weeee died. :P
19:28:32 <Camail> did you fight at th edungeon
19:28:34 <Camail> or on the platforms
19:28:42 <Camail> because fighting him on the dungeon is hard
19:28:49 <DuB`> Around dungeon.
19:28:50 <Camail> but when you have platforms its more manageable
19:28:59 <Camail> he follows you everywhere
19:29:07 <DuB`> Didn't realize head is ACTUALLY invincible in expert mode.
19:29:19 <DuB`> Also apparently you can't go far from dungeon or he one-shots you on expert.
19:29:25 <Runbunny> witness Dot.
19:29:36 <Camail> you can build the platforms around the dungeon
19:29:39 <Runbunny> I am going for a run and it's going to be horrible.
