00:59:21 <Camail> DuB`  the safest way to get look in the dz is to farm landmarks i think
00:59:37 <Camail> 1k per landmark and a free item
01:07:12 <DuB`> Yeah
01:13:06 <Camail> and then you can just hop to every checkpoint vendor and see if there is an item you want
01:13:49 <Camail> i got a nice bolt action that's doing 30k per headshot
01:13:59 <Camail> still not comfortable with what secondary i want to use
01:18:05 <DuB`> O_o
01:18:09 <DuB`> I'm still at 10k headshots lol
01:19:14 <Camail> well i am level 19, and its a purple
01:23:45 <DuB`> Aha
01:23:50 <DuB`> Never even seen a purple.
01:25:59 <Camail> once you reach lvl 15 they start being likew what blue are to you now
01:26:07 <Camail> everything goes up an octave
01:26:49 <Camail> also thats all the DZ vendors sell in the 15-19 range
01:27:17 <Camail> i i just did two landmarks in dz1 and 2, then bought it and shot lots of people
01:27:48 <Camail> the bolt action is really only good if its at your current level and can 1-shot basic enemies and snipers
01:40:25 <Camail> oh snap I'm at 99% for lvl 19, gotta make sure not to kill anyone...
01:58:54 <Camail> fucking hell all i need is an orange scarf to finish my Asimov palette 
01:59:05 <Camail> but no, no orange accent scarves to be found
01:59:11 <Camail> not even a burnt orange

02:21:56 <DuB`> nn reif!
02:22:16 <Dot`> gnight reif
02:22:20 <DuB`> I finally relented and had to replace my bolt action sniper
02:22:41 <DuB`> Its 4k number just looked so sad next to my 6-8k guns :P
03:01:24 <Camail> buy a new one
03:01:41 <Camail> the dz vendors have one, in my game the W dz2 vendor has it
03:12:09 <Camail> all i need is a holster and gloves to be maxed out as a level 19
03:12:19 <Camail> really this is just giving me the opportunity to replace all my garbage
03:28:45 <Camail> oh also DuB`  headshots aren't crits, i assumed crit+ affected HSes but it doesn't
03:29:06 <Camail> there's a separate stat on some suppressors for hs%+

21:52:21 <Camail> yea so dz1,2,3 is all releative to your level bracket
21:52:28 <Camail> the entire DZ changes per level bracket
21:52:40 <Camail> you can go anywhere, everything goes up a few levels
21:53:02 <DuB`> And if grouped? Average?
21:53:16 <Camail> its about level bracket
21:53:24 <Camail> dfont think you can group with people in a lower bracket
21:53:50 <Camail> so i cant DZ with you, and you cant DZ with dot
21:53:55 <DuB`> Aw
21:54:06 <Camail> but it takes so litle time to level at this point
21:55:51 <Camail> also we still need to do so many main missions

23:12:47 <tredc> happy new year
23:12:48 <Camail> i started opening it but then stopped to kill another guy
23:12:58 <Camail> he stole it, i went rogue while he was opening it and killed him
23:13:22 <Camail> you just have to survive for 90 seconds then its back to normal
23:25:05 <DuB`> Hehe
23:25:27 <DuB`> I also got a solo supply drop, group of two saw and followed me to blockade, went rogue while I had my back turned
23:25:43 <DuB`> But then THEY got bogged down in blockade fight, I chased them down and took it all back
23:26:02 <DuB`> They came back for it as I extracted, sniped them both instantly >:D
23:26:38 <DuB`> Probably should have hit 19 before doing all this instead of being at 18.9...
23:32:36 <Camail> yea maybe not your best choice
23:33:04 <Camail> i was extracting and a group of 3, 2 grouped and one solo came to gank me
23:33:13 <Camail> the solo guy was their spotter so i couldnt kill him or be rogue
23:33:41 <Camail> the other 2, one went rogue as the other hijacked, kill the one guy but could get to the other guy before he finished
23:34:01 <Camail> had nothing to lose so i bumrush chased the other guy with an under levelled vector
23:34:06 <Camail> didn't win that one
23:34:29 <Camail> they were both level 24, if i had a lvl 21 vector it would've been free
23:35:19 <Camail> I'm 98% sure the solo spotter was the guy i killed for the drop
23:36:43 <DuB`> Groups, man
23:37:12 <Camail> well i had the moral victory that i rpedicted the sucker punch and killed the guy who went rogue to kill me
23:37:31 <Camail> the vector is really good in pvp, it feels like
23:37:38 <Camail> maybe SMGs in general
23:37:56 <Camail> if you can strafe around them, the running accuracy is pretty decent
23:38:25 <Camail> also purple holsters in 20+ have all 3 stats
23:38:32 <Camail> i have +110 on all 3 just form my holster
23:39:03 <Camail> yo lets do side missions
23:39:38 <Camail> look at my clothes
23:39:40 <Camail> they are amazing
23:40:32 <Camail> ho ho ho
23:51:46 <Camail> DuB`  I'm at the place, tp to me
23:53:32 <DoT|Phone> duuub please
