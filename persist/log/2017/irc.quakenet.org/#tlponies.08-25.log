00:51:00 <Camail> Dot`  this will probably be the final CR with these guys
00:51:25 <Camail> at which point they will probably take a break, epilogue and wrap it up
00:51:33 <Camail> then figure out all their new stuff
00:51:48 <Camail> tfw DuB` hates dnd
00:51:50 <Camail> confirmed
00:52:55 <DuB`> D:
00:52:59 <DuB`> I COULD stay up.
00:53:10 <DuB`> And just nap and miss some pley time tomorrow after work.
00:53:14 <DuB`> FINE YOU'VE CONVINCED ME.
00:54:16 <Camail> you 100% wont watch the whole thing, its goes from 8-12, this one WILL go longer
00:54:23 <Camail> 8-12 your time
00:54:29 <DuB`> ... oof.
00:54:30 <Camail> will probably go to 1
00:54:46 <Camail> just watch the beginning, then catch the rest on monday
00:54:59 <Camail> I will attempt to not spoil, but no promises
00:55:07 <DuB`> Eh, nah
00:55:21 <DuB`> I'll just sleep then. :P
00:59:39 <Camail> i wonder if they fixed dreadnought
01:01:07 <DuB`> https://gfycat.com/EveryAgedHydra
01:01:13 <DuB`> I predicut some, uh... adjustments.
01:01:16 <DuB`> predict*

03:31:24 <Micen> I feel the worst for Trinket
03:32:26 <Micen> He's just a bear, not a magical bear. Just a bear who has seen and done things no bear should ever have to deal with.  He just has no business fighting gods. He should be in some forest, hunting fish or something. 
03:36:11 <Camail> well he's more than just a bear, remember the bear spirit in the fey wild?
03:36:17 <Camail> laura is just a baby who never wants to use him
03:36:25 <Camail> but he has extra stuff
03:36:33 <Micen> oh yeah! I forgot about bear spirit. 
03:36:44 <Camail> cuz she never uses him, its easy to forget
03:36:56 <Micen> Like i remember he has his bowling ball attack. 
03:49:49 <Camail> guess this isnt the final episode
03:49:54 <Camail> i wasn't clear on how massive the titan was
03:50:00 <Camail> but its like 3000 ft tall
03:51:42 <Micen> yeah he said it was a mobile mountain. 
03:52:43 <Micen> It just felt like it could have been the final confrontation. and Burning man could have been a recovery time for them after all this.
03:58:47 <Camail> i guess they skipped all the pre-thordak fights so i assumed the pace would be similar
03:59:50 <Camail> poor CR are trying to play a cleric and they barely know how to play their own classes
04:07:13 <Micen> im telling you, one of them needs to ascend and become the god of open passages. enemy of the door. 
04:08:14 <Camail> I'd like if there was a god beyond the divine gate, but also not an asshole
04:08:43 <Camail> i wonder how big pike's pearl will be on her god's beach
04:08:48 <Camail> like, boulder sized
04:08:52 <Camail> probably as big as her
04:10:06 <Micen> im curious as to what Vax's role will be with Raven Queen. 
04:19:50 <Micen> Matt looked stumped at that roll. This is great
04:20:20 <Micen> They have so many big things to worry about, and they are looting the tomb instead of dealing with things
04:23:24 <Camail> well it is the tomb of the final king of a world
04:23:28 <Camail> that's gotta be something
04:23:42 <Micen> Thats true. and this is a long time without a break
04:39:48 <Camail> RIP innocent guy
04:43:34 <Camail> GOOD MAGIC ITEMS
04:43:47 <Camail> good good
04:51:04 <Micen> did you see Travis drooling over the belt Taliesin got?
05:02:52 <Camail> toob ad he cant have it
05:02:59 <Camail> or else his beard is gone!
05:06:14 <Micen> im getting sick and tired of my brother. He complains non stop because like a normal person, I keep my phone on the wireless network while I am home so I am not using my data connection. 
05:07:12 <Micen> now he's being a dick and hammering the network because of it.

07:55:13 <micen|droid_> What are you up to?

07:55:41 <micen|droid_> What you fan subbing? 
07:56:16 <motbob> uhm

07:57:47 <motbob> those are the series that I've started and am semi-actively working on
07:59:27 <micen|droid_> I need to get back to work on learning Japanese. 
08:01:56 <micen|droid_> Dub gave me some good resources and I was starting to get the hang of the Hiragana alphabet, but then I dropped the ball on that
08:02:48 <Rawr|Fone> Mistake
08:03:20 <micen|droid_> Which part? Dropping the ball, or learning it in the first place? 
08:03:21 <motbob> knowing hiragana is very useful for fansubbing
08:03:28 <motbob> i think he means anime
08:04:09 <micen|droid_> I just want to be able to read my weeb comics in peace. 
08:05:30 <micen|droid_> Maybe thats what I should start doing while on my pain meds. If I can learn to speak/read while high off my ass it will be much easier while im sober
08:06:00 <micen|droid_> Or I will appropriate asian culture a little and have a drunken mastery over it. 
08:06:56 <motbob> god i love appropriating
08:07:16 <motbob> i've spent the large majority of my free time appropriating japanese culture

16:52:12 <Phearlock> Yes for short clips
16:52:13 <Dot`> it gives the players perpective
16:52:25 <Dot`> but they are inverted here
16:52:28 <Phearlock> And ncie for stuff like CS
16:52:41 <Phearlock> where you have fewer people and more idea where the players are

17:52:58 <DuB`> Ham and cheese is best possible sammich!
17:53:00 <DuB`> Well done.
17:54:44 <Dot`> dub, are you forgetting the bacon and bacon sandwich?
17:55:35 <DuB`> Pff
17:55:38 <Golly> i feel like that car98 scope setup wouldnt work irl...
17:56:08 <DuB`> What's wrong with having a red dot way down on the muzzle? :P
17:56:14 <Dot`> gernally they are spot on when it comes to guns in this game
17:56:22 <Dot`> only taking liberties with ammo type
17:56:23 <Dot`> s
17:59:26 <Phearlock> I just wonder how they put the scope on it.
17:59:32 <Phearlock> Did the duct tape it on?
18:00:41 <Dot`> google it,, i am sure you will find how
18:01:06 <Zounds> lemme know when you want to play cam
18:01:27 <Camail> k I'm gonna get a snack then we can play
18:02:05 <Phearlock> I mean I know how you mount them IRL, but I didn't realize they used the same attachment system for modern optics on the M4, M16, AK, SKS, as the WWII german service rifle
18:02:32 <Phearlock> (hence why I always assume they just tape it on there)
18:03:07 <Dot`> same as why we dont have 2 types of 7.62, 3 types of 5.56 and 2 types of 9mm i guess
18:04:12 <Phearlock> It's a good balance of fun and realism
18:04:17 <Golly> http://m1-garand-rifle.com/ivan-chesnokov.php
18:05:04 <Phearlock> Other fun ideas: Have the lvl 3 helmet make you look through the dirty narrow visor in first person
18:06:27 <Dot`> dammit
18:06:34 <DuB`> :P
18:06:43 <carcinisation> he broke
18:06:49 <Dot`> why are you mocking dub
18:08:31 <DuB`> waow
18:08:40 <DuB`> FPP so much betteeer
18:08:50 <carcinisation> haha golly
18:09:23 <Camail> k zounds i'm good
18:10:21 <Zounds> yep i'm ready
18:10:28 <Zounds> any other horses welcome to join ofc
18:10:54 <Camail> ew no
18:10:59 <Camail> they r gross
18:14:26 <DuB`> O_o
18:14:44 <DuB`> Suddenly 5 people charging into the same open field.
18:15:31 <Dot`>  lol stuck
18:16:21 <Phearlock> I am still not sure which mode I like better. I think FPP works great for the early/midgame spectator wise
18:16:53 <Dot`> this andy
18:16:54 <DuB`> Wow
18:16:55 <Dot`> gg
18:16:58 <Phearlock> But the endgame can end up being not-great and prone to everyone moving at once causing it to be hard to catch the burst of action
18:17:09 <carcinisation> gg
18:23:45 <DuB`> Is it over already?
18:23:57 <Dot`> for today i tink so
18:24:05 <Dot`> 3 games, same as previous

18:27:15 <Zounds> ez game ez life
18:27:18 <Camail> what a slaughter
18:27:25 <Camail> we reached lvl 10 before the clash
18:29:44 <Camail> Zounds  uh oh
18:29:48 <Zounds> ?
18:29:49 <Camail> xenobia and vadasi
18:29:50 <Camail> this wont be good
18:29:57 <Zounds> we'll see
18:33:41 <Zounds> the afk mozu for the first wound was probably wose
18:33:43 <Zounds> worse
18:34:59 <Camail> Zounds told you
18:35:06 <Camail> no mobility and no damage
18:35:08 <Camail> this team comp sucks
18:35:56 <Camail> yup, garbage from second 1

18:51:06 <Dot`> is work trying to kill you skram?
18:52:06 <DuB`> Should we kill work pre-emptively?
18:57:38 <skram> yes please
18:58:47 <Camail> so yea lets not do that again
18:58:58 <Zounds> I did so much work that game tbh
18:59:11 <Zounds> didn't help when we couldn't actually finish anyone
18:59:13 <Camail> we did not have enough damage, or mobility
18:59:19 <Camail> because of our team comp
18:59:24 <Camail> thats the bottom line
18:59:36 <Camail> me and the tyto got fucked
19:00:25 <Camail> you need a team dedicated to playing around vadasi
19:00:29 <Camail> or she's useless
19:01:05 <Camail> you have to play super skirmishy with her
19:01:25 <Camail> you cant outheal damage so she's only good at healing out of combat and getting everyone back tino fights as quickly as possible
19:01:45 <Camail> we did not have the line up to do that
19:02:40 <Camail> she cant even save someone during a chase because she's so slow, they'll just start attacking her
19:19:39 <Camail> DuB`  Dot`  yo
19:19:57 <Zounds> With the right talent build xenobia is a terror
19:20:20 <Camail> that team was weird
19:20:30 <Camail> they just kept coming at us one by one
19:20:41 <Camail> then getting stuck cuz xenobia
19:21:07 <Camail> DuB`  Dot`  hey u fucbois
19:21:29 <Camail> skram too
19:21:30 <Zounds> As well as the mighty slow if you can hit your Q while they're stuck you lower their damage by 60%
19:22:10 <Dot`> i will play a bit later

20:22:08 <Golly> Totally not Ninjas in Pyjamas
20:22:16 <Camail> samurai in formal wear
20:22:39 <Camail> wonder waht blizz's game is
20:22:39 <Phearlock> Suuuuuuure this is a great idea if it worked like regular sports where almost all teams are region based.
20:22:44 <Camail> what profit are they taking fromt his
20:22:46 <Phearlock> But no this is completely retarded
20:22:50 <Camail> its 100% motivated by money
20:23:26 <Camail> its not like we built the entirety of esports on brand, or anything
20:24:41 <Zounds> Can we reform the crew in gigantic
20:25:17 <Zounds> 1 sec then reinvite

20:55:21 <Zounds> Voden worked out anyway
20:55:33 <Camail> i somehow have 750 rubies, dunno how i go them
20:55:38 <Camail> maybe lvl 30 you get +100?
20:55:48 <Zounds> Some milestone or something i don't know
20:55:58 <Camail> none of the heroes i play have good paid skins
20:55:59 <Zounds> I got a bunch too from something
20:56:03 <Camail> rip
20:56:09 <DuB`> Ye, at 710 when it was 200 something before.
20:56:16 <DuB`> Still lv24
20:56:32 <Zounds> I glammed up my sven and voden
20:56:36 <Zounds> both looking pretty stylish now
20:57:08 <Zounds> I was going to get pakko horns but I couldn't get everything
20:57:29 <Camail> Dot` u around?
20:57:57 <DuB`> Mastery rank 4 margrave, one more to go.
20:58:03 <Camail> also lets do discord
20:58:12 <Zounds> I really feel like I barely tickle people in late game as voden
20:59:09 <Camail> doing 200+ a shot isn't bad
20:59:13 <Camail> also poison burst damage
20:59:27 <Camail> you can kill any single dps 1v1, probably
20:59:43 <Zounds> maybe
20:59:46 <Zounds> I took the fighting decoy that game
20:59:55 <Zounds> Does decent damage itself I suppose
21:00:02 <Zounds> It's certainly accurate :P
21:43:57 <Camail> Dot`  pls
21:47:17 <DuB`> My room is like 4 degrees warmer than the rest of the apartment. >:T
21:47:23 <Camail> maybe
21:47:25 <Camail> because computer
21:47:37 <DuB`> 2 of them, even.
21:47:48 <Camail> possibly because computer
21:53:33 <Camail> oh shit
21:53:35 <Camail> half life 3 is dead
21:53:36 <Camail> wow
21:53:54 <Phearlock> I read the thing yeah
21:54:02 <Phearlock> Not unexpected but
21:55:05 <Camail> i havent read it yet
21:55:08 <Camail> dunno if i want to
22:03:21 <Phearlock> That is fair. I don't really care about the story enough anymore that it's a big deal if the script is legit or not.
22:03:58 <Phearlock> And don't really think episode 3 is ever going to be released.
22:03:59 <Camail> i have no reason to distrust it, i'm just stunned
22:04:10 <Camail> valve would've sent a statement out if this was fake
22:04:28 <Camail> and its been hours
22:05:23 <Phearlock> Well having read it, I don't think it would have worked that well as HL3
22:05:32 <Phearlock> It was very much episode 3
22:06:52 <Camail> this more just shows that they are done with the franchise
22:07:16 <Camail> clearly it was never half life 3, but this story needed to end before a hl3 could be made
22:08:23 <Camail> ever since we saw the dry dock for the borealis in portal 2, I've really really wanted to go there
22:08:29 <Camail> that's the biggest bummer for me
22:09:35 <Phearlock> Yeah from reading the script it could have been super fun to play
22:09:41 <Camail> oh shit
22:09:44 <Camail> portal was in michigan
22:09:51 <Camail> thats fun
22:10:37 <Camail> also i am super bummed the portal/hl crossover wont ever happen
22:19:34 <Camail> maaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnn.....sad now
22:19:45 <Phearlock> =(
22:20:05 <Camail> what a good plot
22:28:24 <Dot`> well that took longer than expected, had supper then watched star citizen presentation
22:28:34 <Dot`> started an hour late, game crashed half way thorugh

22:38:38 <Dot`> AI
22:38:49 <DuB`> Wooo
22:39:02 <Dot`> a lot of ship reworks
22:39:49 <Dot`> things like the ship takes damage on the spot it gets hit
22:40:27 <Dot`> so you can spray a line of bullets down the side of a ship and see though where they penetrated the plate
22:41:00 <Dot`> the game is a mess but its coming together and 3.0 is a big step towards that
22:41:11 <Dot`> sp many parts
