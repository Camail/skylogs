01:31:42 <Dot`> dub, on duolingo my skills have all deteriarated
01:32:04 <DuB> Yeh, I totally forgot about it while I was at home.
01:32:48 <Cane> Dear Overwatch peoples: Is Sombra good/used in comp?
01:33:37 <Dot`> just dont pick hanzo cane and we will like you
01:33:51 <Dot`> and Mei is LITRALY the devil
01:34:02 <Dot`> i tihnk that covers everything important
01:34:23 <Cane> No, I'm asking because Sombra seems a bit awkward.
01:34:31 <Cane> Not because I want her to be my boo.
01:34:35 <DuB> Cane, sombra requires pretty great teamplay, I think.
01:34:56 <DuB> She's less consistent than tracer if you're just using her harassment aspect.
01:35:05 <Cane> Yeah, I had more fun with Tracer.
01:35:07 <DuB> Her advantage over tracer is the ult.
01:35:11 <DuB> Yep yep
01:35:14 <Dot`> i read sometihng that said, if your trying to kill people as sombra your doing it wrong
01:35:30 <Dot`> pick at health, get ult, cast, die watch team fail
01:35:35 <Dot`> i tihnk that was the order
01:35:55 <DuB> If you coordinate with teammates using the healthpack ult charge thing, she can get ult faster than anyone in the game and then win you a big first fight.
01:36:00 <DuB> But coordination. :P
01:36:14 <Dot`> co-ordi.. wat dub?
01:36:49 <Dot`> is that the tihng where we all go the same way and die becuase we are bunched?
01:36:59 <Cane> With the what now?
01:37:09 <Dot`> or where we try to flank and get picked off becuase we are spread out
01:37:17 <DuB> When she hacks a healthpack and a teammate uses it, sombra gets ult charge.
01:37:19 <DuB> For some reason.
01:37:21 <DuB> Like, a lot.
01:37:33 <Cane> Ah.
01:42:26 <DuB> Dot`who are your favorite to play?
01:42:30 <DuB> Lots of zarya today.
01:43:24 <Dot`> depends how i feel i guess

08:46:01 <Rawr|Phone> That is probably true for every game dub
08:46:02 <DuB> After 30 seconds of hanamura defense, lucio decides that we're all garbage and not doing enough (we had held fine so far), so he goes to their spawn and suicides, then comes back as genji.
08:46:04 <DuB> We lose first point.
08:46:08 <DuB> Woop woop

09:38:30 <Camail> but the final boss is basically a slightly better version of what shadow of mordor did

10:47:17 <tredc> morning DoT`
10:50:44 <CockRoach|42> morning dot
10:57:08 <DoT_> Micen
10:57:38 <Micen> Yes Dot?
10:58:04 <DoT_> is this how americans do puzzles? http://imgur.com/gallery/BDFfe  its weird
10:58:32 <DoT_> almost 1 row at a time in order
10:58:48 <Micen> kinda
10:59:06 <Micen> I do it different than that
10:59:13 <CockRoach|42> there's not enough food in that picture, must be shopped
10:59:16 <Micen> I build the frame then work my way in. 
10:59:24 <Micen> trying to match colors. 
10:59:42 <DoT_> always edgy bits first, i dont tihnk you could do a puzzle any other way
10:59:59 <Micen> well you CAN. but its much much harder
11:00:32 <Micen> if you had a way to mark the center pieces, it would be harder to then build the puzzle out
11:00:49 <Micen> also extra hard mode, dont look at the box once you start work on the puzzle
11:01:50 <Micen> I haven't assembled a puzzle in years 
11:01:54 <Micen> that sounds fun
11:02:33 <DoT_> WTF, the guy who played father Mulcahy in MASH passed away :(
11:03:06 <Micen> yeah i heard
11:03:20 <Micen> 2016 got one last fuck you in before it left. 
11:03:26 <Micen> pardon my language. 
11:03:51 <DoT_> it will be weird watching it once they are all gone
11:05:12 <Micen> I still need to sit down and give the show a serious watch. 
11:05:14 <DoT_> i hear america had fun with some singer on stage
11:05:25 <Micen> ?
11:05:56 <DoT_> http://imgur.com/gallery/qpGDaI5
11:06:26 <DoT_> I did a puzzle with family 2 days ago, 1000 piece in under 4 hours, not bad
11:06:53 <DoT_> when i say with family, my gran looked at it and my mom helped for a bit, lazy people!
11:06:57 <Micen> i didnt watch any of the new year stuff

17:15:41 <Cane> We'll be the best of friends.
17:16:03 <Dot`> hows the practice going cane?
17:16:10 <Dot`> and who are you liking?
17:16:17 <Dot`> tracer, mcree?
17:16:23 <Dot`> zrya?
17:16:27 <Cane> Played a couple of quick play games yesterday before bed, I like the game. =) I have a hang of things now even though I don't know the maps at all.
17:16:34 <Cane> So I'll be butt until I learn the maps and what team comps should look like.
17:16:37 <Cane> But I can play.
17:16:57 <skram> Team comps are easy
17:17:02 <skram> Add tanks until victory
17:17:10 <reification> 2 dps 2 heal 2 tank is fine comp 
17:17:19 <Dot`> but 4 tanks better comp
17:17:20 <Cane> Tracer, Zen, Pharah, 76, D.Va, Ana are the ones I've played the most so far.

17:17:44 <Dot`> have you tried lucio?
17:17:48 <Dot`> wall riding is fun
17:17:48 <reification> all fine choices
17:18:09 <Cane> Was going to, but I couldn't immediately get the hang of wall riding so I decided to practice that outside of quickplay.
17:18:19 <Zounds> I just lost a game to a super tracer
17:18:29 <Zounds> Well, an average tracer who was never attacked by anyone but me
17:18:32 <Dot`> yea, all the surfaces are very bitty, sucks for smopoth wall riding
17:18:32 <Zounds> but it was annoying as hell
17:18:57 <reification> a good tracer tends to be so
17:19:08 <Zounds> I need to win 2 games in a row to get into plat essentially
17:19:10 <ZK> woahhhh i won a tvt
17:19:13 <Zounds> but i'm stuck in a loop of win 1 lose 1
17:19:15 <Cane> Zounds, I finally got the hang of tracking my target as Tracer yesterday, was harder than playing Scout in TF2.
17:19:31 <Zounds> There's less air strafe funny business so I think it's easier in the long run
17:19:48 <Zounds> Though ofc its tracking rather than flicks
17:20:09 <Cane> I dunno, the fact that Scouts have a shotgun means it's easier to land hits with them I think.
17:20:45 <Cane> You learn pretty quickly to flick your crosshair over the target and just press the button, but actually tracking a target over a full second is hard, especially when you also want to blink or rewind.
17:21:03 <Zounds> True enough
17:21:14 <Cane> Fun though, Tracer is one of my favorites.
17:21:21 <Cane> Mostly stuck playing D.Va where I'm at though, since few people play tanks.
17:21:26 <Cane> Or Zen, since also few people play healers.
17:21:42 <Zounds> Zen is my healer of choice
17:21:50 <Cane> Zen is freaking great.
17:21:53 <Zounds> Hard to solo heal with maybe but I really think i'm better of putting the hurt on people
17:21:56 <Zounds> I win more that way :/
17:22:41 <reification> playing tracer will learn you the maps
17:22:57 <skram> Unfortunately Zen's limited healing output and completely counterable ult makes him mostly unviable in comp
17:22:59 <Cane> You have to learn where the health pickups are.
17:23:04 <skram> Despite discord orb being awsome
17:23:10 <Cane> I still don't know the maps too well, don't know all the shooting lines so I get sniped as Pharah quite a bit.
17:23:18 <reification> zen is good for when you have to play support but still wanna murder things
17:23:43 <Bio> cute little murder robot
17:23:46 <Zounds> At my shitty level i have good success with zen since enemy anas waste their grenades often
17:24:16 <Zounds> But I totally could see outside of potato league it just being frustrating getting countered every time
17:24:20 <skram> I've noticed that all the good Anas use biotic grenades mostly to block healing
17:25:24 <skram> If it werent for biotic grenade being stupid good, zen would be excellent to counter the tank meta thing
17:25:29 <reification> guess if your in a heal/tank meta it’s important to get a kill
17:25:38 <skram> If it does get rebalanced im pretty sure we'll see a lot more zen
17:26:00 <Cane> Have pro team comps ever made use of Sombra to hack tanks to prevent them using their abilities ahead of a push?
17:26:09 <Cane> Seems like that's what she's designed to do but I don't know how viable it really is.
17:26:09 <skram> Yeah
17:26:23 <Zounds> That's pretty much all i've ever seen her do
17:26:33 <skram> Complexity often runs sombra for that purpose
17:27:16 <skram> If you hack a healthpack you can charge the ult crazy fast and use it to break the frontline
