00:00:26 <Camail> Dot`  you talking about the dream version of the false knight?
00:00:36 <Dot`> yea
00:10:30 <Camail> i think the trick is mostly movement based
00:10:47 <Camail> i remember it took me awhile to figure out where to stand, then i just fucked him
00:10:59 <Camail> also dot if you didnt remember, you can use the glass charms vs dream bosses
00:11:11 <Camail> its a free +50% damage
00:11:46 <Camail> lmfao dot i am reading this pubg drama
00:11:47 <Dot`> yea, im not worried i wont get him, just found it funny how badly he destroyed me on my first 3 attempts
00:12:05 <Dot`> its so dumb cam lol
00:12:20 <Camail> literally pretending all the reddit comments dont exist because they are usless
00:12:27 <Camail> its just funny to see h3h3 and tb both comment
00:12:42 <Camail> grimzzz used to be part of the fgc, this is all so surreal
00:13:37 <Camail> he did a dumb thing, but w/e
00:14:06 <Camail> its also hilariously poorly timed with h3h3 winning a lawsuit about this exact same thing hours before this started 
00:16:18 <Dot`> it wouldnt have been nearly this big but recently there has been a hugs thing about strema snipers
00:16:44 <Dot`> and some streamers like grimz asking viewers even to report people that kill him
00:16:51 <Dot`> normal dumb stuff
00:16:57 <Dot`> and then this happend
00:17:23 <Camail> its weird that pubg doesnt have any veteran gamers to guide them through this
00:17:32 <Camail> because this kinda of problem has existed for...forever
00:17:48 <Camail> like, any game without perfect information being streamed
00:18:07 <Dot`> yea, its really just a lack of co-ordinated response form developers and player unknown
00:18:21 <Dot`> the few replies i have seen have been varied and not concise
00:18:22 <Camail> they dont even need to respond, imo
00:18:28 <Dot`> but they did
00:18:30 -!- BioPhone [~androirc@mobile-166-170-220-209.mycingular.net] has joined #tlponies
00:18:31 <Dot`> and badly
00:18:32 <Camail> its really, really not their problem
00:18:41 <BioPhone> Lel
00:19:02 <BioPhone> He pissed off the biscuit
00:19:29 <Camail> any further agitation by the players or viewers is entirely on the players and viewers, any time they can stop being dumb and solve their own problem
00:19:46 <Camail> the one thats already solved
00:20:11 <Camail> in cs, in sc, in any competitive game where you REALLY care about winning this match
00:20:11 <Dot`> cam, going back a few months now if i recall correcly they put out a statement saying stream snipers would be punished, which led to confusion and streamers trying to form lynch mobs
00:21:19 <Dot`> like a lot of streamers dont care about it, but vocal minority 
00:21:38 <Dot`> and the statement just made it so much worse
00:21:58 <Camail> thats not inconsistent, seems to make sense
00:22:13 <Dot`> player unknown said something else
00:22:14 <Camail> and yea, if you can identify people doing it you can punish them sure
00:22:34 <Dot`> and then they also tried to reword thier decsion
00:22:39 <Camail> it must all just be reddit/twitter drama
00:22:58 <Dot`> it is
00:23:03 <Dot`> as i said, its all really stupid
00:23:23 <BioPhone> Who doesn't love nerd drama tho
00:23:30 <Dot`> and reddit/twitter is where most people learning about the game get there info
00:23:38 <Camail> so its streamers with egos, and their legion of 13 year old fans
00:23:44 <Dot`> yes
00:23:50 <Dot`> as always
00:24:02 <Camail> I can hear it dot, my fucks are evaporating into the wind
00:24:14 <Dot`> ah yes, then horns where introduced
00:24:18 <Camail> soon they will spread into the atmosphere, unrecognizable 
00:24:22 <Dot`> and people drove around honking
00:24:33 <Camail> and thats what grimz DMCAd
00:24:45 <Dot`> and streamers like grimmz starting saying they where all stream snipers following im
00:24:50 <Dot`> they wernt
00:24:58 <Dot`> they where just honking horns because 
00:25:18 <Dot`> so then this group now actually did that and recorded it
00:25:20 <Camail> well now he'll die or learn, either way is fine with me
00:25:36 <Camail> sad such a big streamer got his balls too big
00:25:42 <BioPhone> He fed the trolls cam
00:25:43 <Dot`> thats the whole story of pubg drama for the past few months
00:25:52 <BioPhone> You don't feed the trolls
00:25:54 <Dot`> I just want vaulting to be in
00:27:44 <Dot`> the video was amusing, but it became great after it was taken down
00:29:23 <BioPhone> I just passed a group of people playing fake quiddich
00:29:41 <BioPhone> Ytho
00:29:53 <Camail> the pubg tournament was kinda awful, maybe the first person tourny will be better
00:30:02 <Dot`> i hope so cam
00:30:09 <Dot`> but that observing was SO bad
00:30:33 <Dot`> thats like watching probes mine while an important engagment happens
00:30:36 <Camail> i dont think it's the obs fault as much as it looks
00:30:48 <Camail> because they do NOT have the tools to navigate the map well
00:31:52 <Camail> certainly could've been better with the current resources, but there were other factors
00:32:12 <Dot`> there are many problems, its not tourny ready, 3pp is stupid  in some ways
00:33:02 <Dot`> but thats what everyone was expecting
00:33:12 <Dot`> and why i was shocled to see over 100k watching
00:34:58 <Dot`> i also worry that the style of play a tourney encourages isnt good for spectating
00:35:37 <Camail> people are gonna watch because its the first, and hype is still very high
00:36:10 <Camail> even when the game is better, which it absolutely will be, the viewers won't have that rush of the first tourny
00:36:17 <Camail> BUT, fps time is soon
00:36:20 <Dot`> i suppose, ive seen it before becuase i watched the arma BR ones
00:39:34 <Camail> this is the obs station, apparently https://twitter.com/aWildWatermelon/status/899931773722873857
01:01:28 <Camail> ded

01:03:01 <Phearlock_> you had it right the first time, no worries
01:10:40 <BioPhone> Doit mot

13:58:59 <Micen> buy me a plane ticket and a passport and ill come make soups
13:59:19 <Micen> and i guess doughnuts since thats what i seem to be known for

13:59:53 <Micen> i havent made doughnuts in well over a year now
14:01:14 <reification> now i want to make them but i’m fasting today…
14:01:45 <Micen> prep your dough. use a yeast and let it sit for 12 hours
14:02:44 <Micen> the dough needs time to rise, unless you were planning more of a cake doughnut

17:00:59 <DuB`> Ye
17:01:16 <DuB`> It's been kinda cool seeing the different teams' playstyles start to show.
17:01:27 <Dot`> team games today?
17:01:36 <DuB`> Duos right now.
17:01:40 <Dot`> ooo
17:01:44 <Dot`> how many i miss?
17:01:49 <DuB`> Two?
17:01:50 <DuB`> I think.
17:01:50 <Dot`> Duos are the best
17:02:19 <DuB`> Liquid seems to pretty consistently take cars and zoom around to far-off places to farm loot.
17:02:26 <Dot`> who won the first 2?
17:02:29 <DuB`> A few times they've had military all to themselves.
17:02:34 <DuB`> Um
17:02:40 <DuB`> Some random one this last one.
17:03:25 <DuB`> Oh yeah, mithrain and his teammate the first one.

17:04:37 <Dot`> this obs is embarasing
17:05:02 <DuB`> ... yeah that happened.
17:05:28 <DuB`> The last game final circle was right on the beach, and like a dozen of final twenty were just hiding in the water.
17:05:34 <Dot`> what player strema you been watchign dub?
17:05:47 <DuB`> They all died at once as soon as it closed., :P
17:05:53 <DuB`> Main stream for now.
17:06:57 <Dot`> i was hoping for freak accidents, people falling thorugh the floor, buildings not spawning, you know, the spectacular kind of fails

17:09:35 <DuB`> Ah, a bit farther down.
17:09:51 <DuB`> Yeah I did want to watch adren actually, his team always in in lotsa fights.
17:10:10 <Dot`> link
17:10:21 <Camail> yea because they arent desperate 18 year olds playing the lame game for the paycheck
17:10:22 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/adren_tv
17:10:43 <DuB`> Camail, so many fish.
17:10:47 <DuB`> Such bad TTours
17:11:10 <Camail> maybe if 95% of the players didn't avoid all conflict...
17:11:22 <Camail> like they make it to the second to last circle with 40 people, what the fuck
17:11:38 <Dot`> its the sme issue they had in arma 3 br
17:11:54 <Camail> this is no longer "omg its so cool that you can play defensively isn't this so different"
17:12:00 <Camail> this is them playing optimally
17:12:15 <Camail> and optimal, in this setting, is boring as fuck
17:12:24 <Dot`> they need to shift the points value maybe
17:12:30 <Camail> tomorrow is the only tournament that matters
17:12:33 <Dot`> so you get more for killing people than currently
17:12:43 <Dot`> that MIGHT get more action
17:13:25 <Camail> this is going to be a problem for the game itself, not just the tourny
17:13:31 <Dot`> yea
17:13:55 <Camail> killing people gives you map control, which isn't as valuable because you get it for free in 3pp
17:14:28 <DuB`> Liquid always military.
17:14:35 <Camail> its fun to think about chasing fights to secure future angles
17:15:00 <Camail> but not now, not when money is involved
17:15:03 <Camail> waaaay too risky

20:31:46 <DuB`> I'm watching this and thinking I could get the exact same thing booting up my old ps3 and playing the mw1 disc I haven't touched since early high school.
20:32:04 <Runbunny> it's team liquid O:

20:33:04 <Dot`> dub, and 10 years and all they did with SC remsatred was update graphics

20:36:49 <DuB`> I dunno what this game mode is.
20:37:33 <Runbunny> Sacrifice, I am not sure how it works though
20:39:27 <skram> never seen quake that wasnt 1v1 dm i think
20:42:18 <tredc> it is a mix of ctf and point defence only one "flag" (the soul)  and you gain percent once you have it at your objective (obelisk) and then  the other team have to captore the point to gain ther soul an bring it to their objective
20:43:37 <skram> cool
