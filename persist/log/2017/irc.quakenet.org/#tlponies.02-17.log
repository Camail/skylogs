02:20:34 <Micen|Droid> Hi
02:20:43 <Micen|Droid> Dot
02:21:00 <Micen|Droid> You all see the pony movie news? 
02:21:36 <DoT_> there is much news
02:21:42 <DoT_> which one?
02:22:08 <Micen|Droid> The news that confirmed seaponies
02:22:13 <Micen|Droid> Shoo be do
02:22:55 <Phearlock> Do we still do spoiler rules?
02:23:13 <Phearlock> Cause stuff related to the movie does fall under spoiler rules
02:24:12 <Micen|Droid> Also some episode titles from the new season were leaked that seem interesting. 
02:24:27 <Micen|Droid> All sorts of exciting stuff 
02:24:52 <DoT_> i dot know phear? are you avoiding spoilers?
02:25:10 <Phearlock> Not really, but I don't know if anyone else is
02:25:59 <Micen|Droid> I know there are only a few of us who keep up with the current product still
02:26:11 <Micen|Droid> Hard to believe we are going into season 7
02:26:36 <DoT_> i havnt heard anyone trying to avoid spoilers for over a season
02:26:45 <DoT_> except me
02:26:57 <DoT_> but thats only like end of season ep
02:27:15 <Micen|Droid> Spoilers. There are cute ponies
02:27:27 <Phearlock> I am absolutely looking forward to the movie though
02:27:30 <Phearlock> and season 7 =3
02:27:42 <Micen|Droid> So much talent in the movoe
02:28:03 <Micen|Droid> Even if the switch to Toonboom or whatever changed the style a bit
02:28:23 <DoT_> is the cat thing an actual thing? or a joke
02:28:28 <DoT_> in the movie
02:28:32 <Micen|Droid> Cat thing? 
02:28:41 <DoT_> the anthro cat
02:28:41 <Micen|Droid> Not sure
02:28:56 <Micen|Droid> Link? 
02:29:11 <Phearlock> Cat seems legit
02:29:15 <DoT_> i saw it on reddit like a week ago with the rest of the character reveals
02:29:57 <DoT_> i just dont feel the cat fits AT ALL with the style but besides that i am looking forward to pony
02:30:17 <Micen|Droid> It looks like it is. 
02:31:53 <Micen|Droid> Meghan McCarthy confirmed it
02:32:24 <Micen|Droid> So did Larson
02:32:52 <DoT_> blarg
02:33:55 <Micen|Droid> Shit, that cat looks like my pre pony days fursona I had. 
02:34:19 <Phearlock> hey never know, might look better in motion
02:35:25 <Micen|Droid> It might
02:35:33 <Micen|Droid> Brad 2.0

18:27:10 <skram> what'd you think
18:30:02 <Dot`> i dont like spiders
18:30:37 <skram> when i was a little girl
18:30:44 <skram> i had a fear of spiders
18:30:51 <Runbunny> What is going on?
18:30:57 <skram> memes
18:31:20 <Runbunny> Only pictures can be memes skram.
18:31:35 <skram> thats what you think anders
18:31:46 <Runbunny> like this one https://vkper.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/millhouse.png
18:32:09 <reification> i have ordered endolysins from a swiss biotech corp. hopefully they do the trick
18:32:22 <skram> The picture name kinda ruins it runbun
18:32:36 <skram> reif: is those THE DRUGS?
18:33:00 <Runbunny> What do you need endolysins for?
18:33:07 <reification> not fun ones skram.
18:33:54 <reification> the same thing bacteriophages need them for runbun 
18:34:17 <skram> what do bacteriophages need them for
18:34:17 <reification> doing an alien impression on bacteria
18:34:49 <Runbunny> well if you just need to lyse bacteria, there are cheaper (?) alternatives, like sonication or mechanical stress.
18:35:03 <reification> i only want to kill one type
18:35:13 <Runbunny> or antimicrobial agents.
18:35:43 <Runbunny> Use a phage specific to target bacterial strain then? :P
18:36:07 <reification> yes
18:36:38 <DuB`> Wut
18:36:55 <skram> reif has weird hobbies, DuB`.
18:37:11 <DuB`> Seems so.
18:37:34 <reification> i thought of you when i had a wierd tax issue with my shares ISA dub
18:37:51 <DuB`> ;D
18:38:09 <reification> the best part was convincing my brokerage that the exchange was in toronto not london
18:42:05 <reification> i did end up getting substanially more monies than i expected when the issue came up so that was nice :D
18:42:23 <DuB`> Hooray for money!
18:42:36 <skram> I havent done my taxes in years
18:42:39 <skram> it just does itself
18:43:00 <Runbunny> ^
18:43:11 <DuB`> They're pretty easy when you have almost no income and just some school deductions. :P
18:43:46 <skram> the lesson of this story
18:43:50 <skram> stay homeless
18:43:52 <skram> save on taxes
18:44:39 <DuB`> ...the goal is to MAXIMIZE after-tax INCOME, not just reduce taxes. :P
18:45:30 <skram> oh
18:46:41 <Runbunny> I don't really have a say in that do I?
18:47:03 <skram> probably
18:47:16 <Runbunny> Like I can put my tax percentage lower, but then I just have to pay more at tax returns.
18:47:59 <skram> there are things that you can put on your thing to make you pay less tax anders
18:48:09 <skram> like babby or debt
18:48:35 <DuB`> Individual taxes are whatever.
18:48:52 <Runbunny> yeah but I have any that I can deduct from taxes.
18:48:57 <DuB`> I only know about corporation/partnership/llc strategy. :P
18:53:06 <Runbunny> Maybe I don't have to pay taxes for Skram.
18:53:16 <skram> are you the person that would make up stupid ways to save monies, dub?
18:53:29 <skram> you still should tho anders
18:53:32 <DuB`> Not stupid!
18:53:43 <DuB`> Congress makes the law code, not me. :P
18:54:34 <skram> right
18:54:40 <skram> so you do the illegal bits
18:54:49 <DuB`> Never illegal!
18:54:50 <DuB`> Psh.
18:55:07 <Runbunny> Dub is illegal?
18:55:07 <skram> legal-ish then
