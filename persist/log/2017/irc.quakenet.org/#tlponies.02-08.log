12:56:15 <DoT|Phone> so rude
12:59:52 <DoT|Phone> alllll alooooone
13:03:28 <CockRoach|42> calm down hors pon
13:03:40 <DoT|Phone> No
13:03:45 <CockRoach|42> do you know everything about income tax now?
13:06:17 <ZK> it's about paying money
13:08:00 <DoT|Phone> all the money
13:08:19 <DoT|Phone> .roll d20 to boop zk
13:08:21 <ZK> but if you dont make much money, you get some back
13:08:25 <ZK> .roll d20 to boop Dot-afk
13:08:40 <DoT|Phone> only after already giving it
13:08:57 <motbob> in the usa:
13:09:33 <motbob> - if you make less than $4050, you pay no money and probably get some money
13:09:58 <motbob> - if you make more than $4050, that difference is taxed at 10% or something for a while
13:10:05 <ZK> what if you arent an american citizen?
13:10:07 <motbob> - the percentage goes up from there
13:10:23 <motbob> same thing except there's no chance that you will get money
13:11:15 <motbob> you still don't pay up to $4050 though. Actually I just looked it up again, it's like $10,000
13:11:26 <motbob> so under $10k you don't pay
13:11:45 <CockRoach|42> income per year?
13:11:50 <motbob> yes
13:12:08 <motbob> if you have kids, that number rises by $4000/kid
13:12:33 <motbob> you also stand to get a lot of money from the govt if you have kids (in the thousands of dollars)
13:12:48 <motbob> you have to work in order to get the money though
13:12:58 <CockRoach|42> oh... :|
13:12:58 <DoT|Phone> how much work
