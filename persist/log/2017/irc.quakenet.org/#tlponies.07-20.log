21:19:34 <Dot`> so what happend to his eye?
21:20:21 <DuB`> Oh is that zanster?
21:20:22 <DuB`> LOL
21:20:33 <DuB`> I saw him tweeting, he got shot in the eye with a nerf gun earlier this week.
21:21:19 <Dot`> lol
21:21:37 <Dot`> thats not manly, should have said it was a bear
21:27:44 <ZK-phone> Zanster vs heromarine might be fun
21:37:06 <Dot`> terrran!
21:40:59 <ZK-phone> Lol this hurts
21:42:22 <Dot`> shame

21:59:45 <ZK-phone> Shopping time
21:59:51 <ZK-phone> Fudge and taffy
22:00:03 <DuB`> Both good things.
22:00:57 <ZK-phone> Also burgers and milkshake 
22:01:03 <ZK-phone> American goodness
22:01:05 <DuB`> Even better things.
22:08:52 <Camail> its weird that milkshakes are an american thing
22:09:02 <Camail> when they havent been popular since like, the 50's
22:12:17 <Dot`> milkshakes are like pizzas to me, no real country connatations to them
22:13:38 <DuB`> USA
22:14:06 <Phearlock> Yeah I never thought about where they were from.
22:17:23 <Dot`> but its intresting that to americans its still a cultural thing
22:18:57 <DuB`> No self-respecting burger place would not serve milkshakes!
22:19:14 <skram> i dont like milkshakes
22:19:24 <Dot`> are burger places a big tihng dub?
22:19:47 <Dot`> skram, you also dont care for dogs, your opinions are very wierd
22:20:00 <DuB`> Of course they are, dot.
22:20:24 <skram> i do care for dogs Dot`, i just dont want to touch them
22:20:38 <Dot`> thats unaceptable
22:20:41 <CockRoach|42> racist :|
22:20:45 <DuB`> Entirely unacceptable.
22:20:51 <Dot`> they are soft and cute and NEED attention
22:21:12 <DuB`> When I eventually visit EU I will specifically... RENT a puppy or something and go find skram.
22:21:15 <skram> no, sometimes, i am not an enabler
22:22:08 <Dot`> Dub, you will need to bring puppy here first for confirmation it is soft
22:22:48 <skram> you guys are very judgemental
22:22:54 <DuB`> Oke dot
