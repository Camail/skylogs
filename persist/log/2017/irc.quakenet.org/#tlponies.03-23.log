01:36:26 <Dot`> im proud of you cam
01:37:22 <Camail> I am really a fan of the last boss fight
01:37:36 <Camail> its not insanely hard but it's probably the hardest boss fight in the game
01:37:58 <Camail> but there's is absolutely a learnable strat for everything the boss does
01:38:26 <Camail> and its not the boring dark souls "ok learn the animation and dodge when you need to"
01:38:36 <Camail> that's one thing I'm kind of getting bored with
01:38:44 <Camail> with fromsoft in general
01:39:49 <Camail> also i TOTALLY rebeat the boss again first try but i got super sloppy and died right before the literal last hit

12:34:36 <Dot`> phear, the onyl complaints ive seen are the animations being really bad
12:34:48 <Phearlock> Seen some of those here and there
12:34:51 <Dot`> but i havnt really looked at reports on it
12:34:55 <Dot`> Jonas
12:34:58 <Phearlock> Not really AAAAAA standard sure
12:35:11 <skram> I wouldnt say they are really bad
12:35:17 <skram> but odd enough to make it weird
12:35:19 <Phearlock> But I guess some ppl mind more than others?
12:35:28 <Dot`> ppl like to complain phear
12:35:36 <Phearlock> ye
12:35:40 <Dot`> always assume its not as bad as people say
12:35:55 <skram> and facial expressions are not really on point
12:36:20 <Phearlock> Yup yup

18:44:13 <motbob> after the bankruptcy midterm I took two weeks ago, everyone complained about it. I complained too! It was such a bullshit exam, basically just a test of how fast you could read and write. Impossible to prepare for
18:44:46 <motbob> Today I found out that I got an A in the exam. Obviously, it was totally fair and balanced and everyone who complained is a whiner

18:58:56 <Camail> GET GOT
18:59:00 <Camail> aaaaaahaahaha
18:59:11 <Camail> trust no one, dot
18:59:24 <Camail> that's what was making me so mad that one day
18:59:55 <Camail> I'll let that betrayal sink in for awhile, it is an important part of this game
19:04:44 <Dot`> DUM BUGS
19:04:59 <Dot`> should have used ghost blade on her
19:05:16 <Camail> i had it happen before i got the dream nail
19:06:02 <Camail> but dot now you get to have the anxiety of running around with all the money
19:06:06 <Camail> isnt that fun
19:07:16 <Camail> man the hollowknight wiki is kinda meh
19:07:31 <Camail> its the perfect game to have one but you can tell its only like 3 people
19:16:17 <Dot`> bank had 3k and i was carrying 3.5k when i went to go dram nail bank lady
19:16:25 <Dot`> thats when she was gone
19:18:01 <Camail> yup
19:19:23 <Dot`> but at least i am admired by adorable bug i rescued
19:19:26 <Dot`> even a plushie
19:28:08 <Dot`> rawr http://imgur.com/gallery/6frvk
19:40:38 <Dot`> skram
19:42:44 <Camail> dot how many times have you saved Zote
19:44:39 <Runbunny> Camail is hollow knight worth it? or rather what is your opinion of the game?
19:45:13 <Camail> 1. I've been gushing about it for like 2 weeks now, so yes. But more than that
19:45:33 <Camail> everything about it is very well designed and fun
19:46:01 <Camail> the tone is engaging and the art is unique
19:46:09 <Phearlock> I think it's a good game but camail is really jerking its dick a lot.
19:46:34 <Phearlock> If you like these 2D exporationy platformers, it's a really good one of those.
19:46:48 <Camail> it also depends on if you are good at platformers, with how smooth the pacing will be
19:47:53 <Camail> I would recommend it to anyone, honestly.
19:49:03 <Runbunny> Guess I'll check it out
19:49:27 <Camail> But to put it simply, Guacamelee + dark souls - wrestling
19:49:49 <Phearlock> I'm happy I picked it up when I did or I'd be put off by how much you talked about it lol.
19:49:55 <Camail> i dont care
19:50:04 <Camail> he didnt ask you
19:53:08 <motbob> what a shitty reason to be put off
19:55:10 <Phearlock> It makes the praise feel less obective, you hear too much positive stuff about something and it starts triggering the same alerts as hyped up stuff does.
19:56:38 <Phearlock> Have to start cross referencing other sources to see if it's legit or not.
19:56:52 <Phearlock> Well, legit is the wrong word
19:57:09 <Camail> you do realize that a majority of what I've been saying this last week has been conversations about the game
19:57:12 <Camail> and not praise
19:57:21 <Camail> I've been talking to dot
19:57:37 <Phearlock> Yup
19:57:41 <Camail> or when someone asks me about the game, like zk

19:58:02 <Camail> everyone talking about ponies for three years didnt get you put off that
19:58:10 <Camail> me talking about a game for 2 weeks shouldnt be a problem
19:58:36 <Phearlock> It's not like I got annoyed by it.
20:00:36 <Camail> enough to comment multiple times while someone else is asking me for a recommendation? That looks fairly annoyed
20:01:07 <Golly> ragequit
20:01:19 <Phearlock> I really could have phrased myself better =(
20:01:31 <Phearlock> Cause looking back yeeeah it does look like that doesn't it?
20:17:14 <Zounds> dw Phear he'll forget about it in almost instantly
