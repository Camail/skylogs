12:39:49 <Zounds> hi dot
12:39:58 <reification> i saw it was celtic vs rangers just now and thought of you zounds
12:40:38 <Zounds> yes I managed to dodge that shift
12:40:45 <Zounds> put my time in at braehead instead :P
12:41:06 <reification> sounds wise
12:43:07 <Zounds> there's actually a sports centre just accross the road from celtic park that sometimes has events on the same days
12:43:22 <Zounds> So if you're lucky you can get put there instead
12:44:19 <Zounds> Though celtic fans often try to cut through the building as a shortcut from where they park their cars which can be annoying
12:44:44 <Zounds> normally not at an issue unless there's something going on in the centre though

13:41:50 <ZK> havent tested it as much as id like, still some adjustments i need to do, but I do really enjoy it

13:51:46 <Micen|Droid_> Hello
13:52:04 <Dot`> hedge micen
13:52:05 <reification> dot, youâ€™ve seen lots of bbc sitcoms. have you watched yes minister?
13:52:10 <reification> hey micen
13:53:41 <Dot`> bits, but not much
13:54:01 <ZK> dont your bbc sitcoms only last like 6 episodes?
13:55:01 <reification> seasons are short zk
13:55:12 <reification> thatâ€™s cause they donâ€™t have filler
13:56:34 <ZK> i mean, comedies like the office is basically episodes of filler :P
13:57:24 <reification> that is a) modern and b) a different kind of show
13:57:39 <ZK> wait, waddya mean by modern?
13:59:35 <reification> well itâ€™s in the era when american tv has become strong
14:01:13 <ZK> hmm, so it became strong around what? When Breaking Bad came out? When the Sopranos finished?
14:02:15 <reification> not a step process
14:03:17 <reification> i mean maybe simpsons was first culturally dominant tv?
14:04:01 <reification> iâ€™m thinking buffy time
14:04:57 <reification> and friends
14:06:00 <reification> is notable the office made the uk -> usa jump when so many failed
14:10:45 <reification> BLOOD ALONE MOVES THE WHEELS OF HISTORY!
14:19:59 <Dot`> zk, british shows also tend to end before they get bad
14:20:07 <Dot`> like faulty towers
14:20:24 <Dot`> so few, and so good
14:22:09 <reification> if you want a long running uk sitcom watch last of the summer wine :p
14:22:18 <Dot`> haha, thats true
14:24:20 <reification> only ran for 37 yearsâ€¦
14:25:37 <Dot`> TOO SOON
14:25:46 <Dot`> everythign is taken from us to young
14:25:50 <Dot`> too*

17:58:59 <ZK> roll a dragonborn?
17:59:03 <ZK> how does that work :o
17:59:14 <ZK> doin one shots?
18:02:01 <skram> Dots character died
18:02:06 <skram> he wants a new one
18:04:39 <ZK> oh good
18:04:40 <Dot`> took a great axe to the face zk
18:04:53 <ZK> what were you?
18:04:58 <skram> halvgud got god rolls and we didnt
18:05:02 <Dot`> it was the human warlock
18:05:16 <ZK> so now watcha gonna be?
18:05:22 <Dot`> cleric
18:05:30 <Dot`> light
18:05:37 <ZK> havent look at cleric in 5e, i should do that
18:05:45 <Dot`> we dont have a mage of any sort inn the party
18:05:57 <ZK> pft, you dont need magic
18:05:58 <Dot`> so light cleric can heal and fills the mage roll a bit
18:06:08 <ZK> who needs arcana
18:06:46 <Dot`> not skram
18:06:47 <skram> nobody zk
18:06:51 <ZK> did you decide on your god yet?
18:07:05 <skram> can you make one up
18:07:25 <Dot`> Dragonborn zk, so picked Her Mercy, Tamara
18:07:34 <skram> why dragonborn though
18:07:46 <Dot`> skram hates humans
18:07:48 <ZK> i want half orc cleric
18:07:52 <skram> skram hates everyone
18:08:00 <ZK> actually half orc cleric would be interesting back story
18:08:02 <Dot`> and i was going to pick a human again even though skram hates them then halv suggested dragonborn
18:08:06 <skram> except that elf girl whos name i dont remember who was very impressed with me
18:08:57 <ZK> oooh faerie fire, i like that spell
18:09:12 <Dot`> so really its skrams fault im a dragonborn
18:09:37 <ZK> whats your backstory?
18:09:39 <skram> do dragonborn speak draconic natively
18:09:45 <Dot`> yes skram
18:10:01 <Dot`> still working on it zk
18:11:10 <Dot`> i was in the tough choice zk between light and life cleric
18:11:46 <skram> I had hoped we could be buds in this campaign
18:11:49 <skram> but i guess not
18:12:26 <Dot`> why so racist
18:12:50 <ZK> hes a dwarf, no?
18:12:55 <Dot`> i guess
18:13:16 <ZK> you're like 2 feet higher than him
18:13:19 <Dot`> but i dd pick silver, so its a metalic and not chromatic
18:13:26 <Dot`> no need to hate skram
18:14:55 <Camail> all the hate
18:15:50 <ZK> hm, can't find tamara in official book
18:16:28 <ZK> oh cool, the book has the norse deities
