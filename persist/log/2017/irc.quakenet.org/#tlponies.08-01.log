23:34:55 <DuB`> Whoopsie
23:35:14 <DuB`> Oooh, the international!
23:39:50 <Phearlock> yes that is pettyyyy soon
23:42:50 <motbob> it's nice that TI[number] lines up with the year of 201[number]
23:42:59 <motbob> it's 2017, so it's TI7!
23:43:25 <DuB`> That is convenient, hehe
23:43:29 <motbob> in 2020 we'll finally get to have TI0
23:43:56 <Phearlock> Will they go the roman route and say TI X I wonder
23:44:34 <motbob> TI XD
23:44:49 <DuB`> xD xD xD 
23:45:33 <Bio> LUL XD
23:46:38 <Phearlock> We also could get a nice TI - XI for 11

23:48:30 <motbob> i realized recently that dota and ssbm are both entering an era of decline and people are starting the blame game
23:51:37 <Cane> Dota is?
23:52:19 <motbob> playerbase is down
23:53:18 <Phearlock> So what do we blame?
23:53:27 <Cane> Yeah, where do I point my pitchfork?
23:53:28 <Bio> gaben, obviously
23:53:29 <motbob> the natural life cycle of games probably
23:53:45 <motbob> PUBG
23:53:46 <Cane> motbob, don't be so ridiculous and sensible.
23:53:52 <Cane> Ok, I can blame PUBG.
23:53:59 <Phearlock> Ok I am going to shoot a bit wide here and blame life itself.
23:54:03 <Dot`> we should blame SC2
23:54:04 <Cane> Grr, PUBG. I hear they're adding microtransactions.
23:54:53 <motbob> let's just blame Valve for adding techies
23:55:13 <DuB`> The decline of sc2 was actually an elaborate scheme to infiltrate all other games with sc2-loyal casters and hosts as esports-spies!
23:55:28 <Dot`> the long game
23:55:55 <motbob> right, day9 is hosting TI7
23:56:02 <DuB`> YOU SEE
