12:14:12 <Dot`> i return
12:14:19 <Dot`> well dampend
12:14:33 <Dot`> Hey cane <3
12:14:57 <Cane> Welcome back. =)
12:15:47 <Dot`> got CoP dled, as i couldnt recall if it was that that was modded or if there was a seprate game dl
12:21:49 <Cane> Call of Pripyat needs to be run at least once for Call of Chernobyl to run properly.
12:21:57 <Cane> I think it's just used to check if you have a legit copy.
12:22:06 <Cane> Don't think it even requires files.
12:22:11 <Cane> Just for the thing to have been run once.
12:22:18 <Cane> Call of Chernobyl is its own install.
12:22:22 <Dot`> ah yes, its been a while
12:22:49 <Dot`> i tihnk all my previous stalker mods was on the 1TB that borked
12:23:59 <Cane> Most of them have updates by now anyway. =)
12:24:04 <Cane> Are you gonna play 1.4 or 1.5?
12:24:14 <Dot`> always the latest!
12:24:20 <Dot`> *and most unstable
12:24:25 <Dot`> :P
12:24:32 <Dot`> what you on atm?
12:26:33 <Cane> Making mod list, gimme a sec.
12:26:40 <Dot`> cool
12:29:31 <Dot`> is it one of those "put this one first and half of that one second, then do this part and complete the other" things
12:29:44 <Dot`> or just add one after another no reall issues
12:32:34 <Cane> https://pastebin.com/Jtvj539p
12:32:55 <Cane> Just install sequentially and it'll work.
12:33:01 <Dot`> nice
12:33:14 <Cane> In fact most of these you can install in random order and it'll still be fine, except for some graphics stuff.
12:33:18 <Cane> I installed it in the sequence posted.
12:34:10 <Dot`> so i need to dl 1.5 r2
12:34:16 <Dot`> then use the r4 patch
12:34:48 <Cane> Yep.
12:34:59 <Cane> The r4 patch is pretty small.
12:35:02 <Dot`> yours has been pretty stable the past 2 days
12:35:11 <Dot`> looking promising
12:35:23 <Cane> It crashes some times, but not due to Out Of Memory really.
12:35:30 <Cane> Once or twice a session.
12:35:41 <Cane> of course that's on my system, don't know how it'll be for you. =/
12:37:02 <Dot`> haha, probablt a lot of crashes
12:37:29 <Dot`> i havnt had a dorf fort game work in years and it takes at least 5 attempts to creat a small map to 500 years
12:37:41 <Dot`> somethign in my systems hates it
12:38:01 <Cane> Wow that sucks. =(
12:38:05 <Cane> DF has never been a problem for me.
12:38:07 <Cane> STALKER on the other hand...
12:38:29 <Dot`> it is Masterwork i always try play, maybe thats it
12:38:48 <Dot`> Stalkers main issue i have had is loadign times getting longer and longer
12:39:23 <Cane> I've been astonished that STALKER loads very quickly for me right now.
12:39:37 <Dot`> hopefull sometihng in the mods somewhere
12:39:40 <Cane> I'm used to 1 minute load times, but the last couple of sessions it's loaded in 10 seconds.
12:39:57 <Cane> And quickloading in the same map is like 3 seconds if that.
12:40:09 <Cane> All hail SSD drives I suppose.
12:40:21 <Dot`> yea actually, probably is the main thing
12:41:01 <Cane> Anyway, if you're installing Structures Redux, install bump maps first (before anything else).
12:41:19 <Cane> Even the readme for that says to install it before ANY OTHER MOD.
12:41:26 <Cane> Probably just being safe. =P

13:40:12 <Dot`> cane,  iforgot how to add the mods
13:40:31 <Cane> Copy-paste and overwrite.
13:40:37 <Cane> Most of the folders will have a "gamedata" folder.
13:40:41 <Cane> Run CoC once and it'll create that folder.
13:40:42 <Cane> Ezpz.
13:40:58 <Dot`> ah, didnt run it yet
13:44:29 <Dot`> damn, structures ewdux is another 870 mb
13:45:10 <Dot`> redux*
13:51:42 <Cane> Yuuuup.
13:51:51 <Cane> The first mods on the list are all pretty big.
13:52:13 <Dot`> as long as they are not all that large, will be here all day if thats the case
14:26:12 <Cane> Dot`, how's it going?
14:27:03 <Dot`> dling the weather conversion mod
14:31:59 <Cane> OWR is the last "big" one on the list. After that they're all tiny.
14:32:21 <Dot`> half way through that one now
14:32:31 <Cane> I've been trying to remember what I was going to tweak.
14:32:42 <Cane> When I was streaming yesterday I suddenly remembered a thing I wanted to change, but then promptly forgot about it again.
14:32:46 <Dot`> artifact occurance
14:33:02 <Cane> No, although I may tweak that too.
14:33:12 <Dot`> you mentioned wantign to tweak it
14:33:30 <Cane> Yeah, this was something new. Don't think I mentioned it on stream, I think I just made a mental note.
14:34:10 <Dot`> well that makes it tricky to hep cane!
14:34:14 <Dot`> help even
14:34:58 <Cane> I think it was weapons or trading related. I'm trying to remember.
14:35:34 <Dot`> i was actually meaning to ask about weapon selling costs, but i havnt seen the numbers yet
14:36:22 <Dot`> I tihnk selling most weapons really shouldnt be worth it as there are so many around, while ammo should be expensive
14:36:35 <Dot`> but yea, aI havnt seen the current values, so it may already be like that
14:37:10 <Cane> Very few weapons can be sold, they need to be above 80% durability which most won't be when they drop.
14:37:17 <Cane> Some times it's worth repairing it and then selling it for a tiny profit.
14:37:22 <Cane> But most of the time no.
14:37:25 <Dot`> cool
14:37:32 <Cane> That's base CoC, didn't even have to change that.

14:47:39 <Dot`> still good for 1.5?
14:47:59 <Cane> Yeah, the folder has a 1.4.14+ folder or whatever, the + folder works with any CoC above that.
14:48:12 <Cane> CoC actually included native support for lootmoney in 1.5 beta.
14:52:39 <Dot`> ok, i tihnk its all added, time to have it crash

22:23:50 <Crisium> Cane oh no Stork's group for ASL
22:23:57 <Crisium> group of Death
22:24:03 <Crisium> but will be good to see Stork vs Jaedong 
22:24:21 <Cane> Unless he pulls out some goddamned magic he is so freaking dead.
22:24:32 <Cane> I was hoping for some more killer PvTs from him.
22:24:54 <Cane> Instead we have an all-zerg group, a 3T-1Z group, and the group Bisu is 2-0ing without breaking a sweat.
22:24:59 <Cane> And then there's Stork's group.
22:25:00 <Crisium> stork can win any PvP, he has a strong chance if he plays rain, and he beat JD in exhibition a few weeks ago
22:25:27 <Crisium> yeah not seeing Stork vs T is always disappointing
22:25:35 <Bio> sitting in a bag on my desk dot
22:25:40 <Crisium> yeah Bisu has the group of Life
22:25:40 <Bio> i need a few more thing
22:25:42 <Cane> I've been watching him play a lot on stream, his vs Z is so lacking right now. I really hope he pulls out some magic against JD again.
22:26:05 <Cane> Also this is where Killer dies.
22:26:06 <Bio> Jaedong fighting
22:26:07 <Cane> 3 Terrans.
22:26:09 <Bio> always
22:26:21 <Crisium> but remember 2014 when killer was the terran splayer
22:26:27 <Crisium> he just needs to rewind time before army
22:26:37 <Cane> I want Shine and Larva to make it out of group B so badly. =D
22:26:41 <Crisium> i remember killer made guardians cool again in 2014
22:27:03 <Crisium> shine and larva would be good for unique games in Ro8
22:27:33 <Cane> Goddamn I had so much fun watching Rain vs Ample/Sasin though.
22:27:41 <Crisium> are you kidding
22:27:44 <Crisium> corsairs vs ghosts
22:27:56 <Cane> It was the most beautiful nonsensical thing I've ever seen.
22:27:56 <Crisium> i was freaking out so much here lol when i watched it a few days ago
22:27:58 <Crisium> so good
22:28:04 <Crisium> once in a decade kind of game
22:28:34 <Cane> I feel kinda bad for Ample, seems like he went Ghosts with Lockdown, BoxeR style, to try to beat the Carriers he was certain were coming his way.
22:28:37 <Cane> And then LOL CORSAIRS
22:28:49 <Crisium> he did get a lockdown on a carrier at one point tho :P
22:28:55 <Crisium> but yeah it was wasted
22:29:10 <Cane> Such a fun group.
22:29:16 <Cane> Group F broke my heart though.
22:29:19 <Crisium> we ALMOST got another great thing going on when FBH was going Bio, but snow just proxied him to death
22:29:26 <Crisium> ALMOST bio vs protoss
22:29:58 <Bio> ping
22:29:58 <Cane> I wanted to see that build vs a regular build on that map. Seems like it was designed to punish the super greedy Nexus first builds that every Protoss and their dog do on that map right now.
22:30:15 <Cane> Nexus first into get enough units to get a quick 3rd.
22:30:16 <Bio> been a hot minute since i've been pinged by SC strats
22:30:29 <Cane> And then the marines got proxied to hell.
22:30:40 <Crisium> im always surprised we never see bio builds TBH.  i know why it is not standard, and i dont expect it to be, but youd think youd see it every 10 or 20 games just to keep the P guessing but you never ever do
22:38:15 <Cane> Yeah, it's only to punish super greedy expansion builds. Protoss just has too much splash damage to make bio viable. Also, ping.
22:40:22 <Bio> Bio is always viable imo
22:40:36 <skram> yeah he's pretty great
22:50:36 <Cane> I'd love to see more bio, but it doesn't show up too often.
22:50:57 <Bio> solution is to play zerg, every game is bio
22:53:49 <Dot`> cane, dont you love the scientists
22:53:59 <Dot`> guide to easy anomaly and back, get stone blood
22:54:06 <Dot`> next quest, give stone blood
22:54:08 <Cane> Isn't it great?
22:54:14 <Dot`> get veles detector
22:54:16 <Cane> Easiest start in the game too.
22:54:26 <Cane> If scientists ask you for an artifact, you give it.
22:54:36 <Cane> Don't care if it's the most useful one you have at the moment, you're probably getting an SSP-99M for it.
23:00:28 <Dot`> well now i feel cheated for 'only' getting a good detector
23:30:39 <Dot`> skram
23:31:26 <skram> yeah buddy
23:31:51 <Dot`> what you up to
23:32:07 <skram> looking at cats
23:32:10 <skram> trying not to pass out
23:32:32 <Dot`> Crisium, day9 bw in half an hour
23:32:39 <Dot`> any good cats skram
23:32:53 <skram> subpar
23:33:06 <skram> how is russia simulator
23:33:08 <Dot`> thats 2 days in a row skram
23:33:17 <skram> its very disappointing
23:33:32 <Dot`> i am done for the evening, probably over 10 deaths today
23:33:50 <skram> only 10? those are rookie numbers
23:33:53 <Dot`> but this latest run has had a good start, so just going to leave it as im tired
23:34:42 <Dot`> probably more skram, my first death was me leaving the main clear skies base into probably the safest area on the map
23:34:51 <Dot`> having a bandit step around a corner and 1 shot me
23:35:00 <skram> well
23:35:05 <skram> stop going round corners
23:35:11 <skram> thats how they get you
23:35:14 <Dot`> i didnt
23:35:21 <Dot`> i nev er reached the corner
23:35:32 <skram> just stay far away from them
23:35:37 <skram> bushes too
23:35:39 <skram> and campfires
23:35:46 <skram> better stay inside actually
23:35:48 <Dot`> and caves
23:35:56 <Dot`> they have controllers in them
23:36:02 <Dot`> that sneak up behind you
23:36:14 <skram> shipwrecks too
23:36:22 <skram> they have dudes with gauss rifles in them apparently
23:36:36 <Dot`> and swamps, they have zombies that snipe you with pistols
23:36:48 <Dot`> 1 shot fro macross lakes
23:37:03 <skram> maybe you should just play forklift simulator 2016 instead
23:40:00 <Dot`> i would run myself over
23:41:50 <skram> im gonna try a sleep
23:41:51 <skram> bbl
23:42:11 <Dot`> later skram <3
23:58:35 <Bio> fak
23:58:43 <Bio> i did nothing today
23:58:51 <Bio> and my head aches
