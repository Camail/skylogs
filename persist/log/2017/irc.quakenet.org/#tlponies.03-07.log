00:22:14 <skram> so its basically hobbiton except everyone has a hat
00:22:20 <DuB`> NICE.
00:22:37 <DoT_> skram, does Level 4 NVQ mean anything to you?
00:22:41 <DuB`> Dot do you think that finance slot is still open?
00:22:59 <skram> no dot
00:23:21 <DoT_> ok skram , i found a line in the thing 
00:23:24 <DoT_> We recruit Engineering Higher Apprentices into our civil business, defence services and, nuclear business.
00:23:31 <DoT_> and another line
00:23:32 <skram> does it have something to do with the fact that you have engineering apprenticeships
00:23:39 <DoT_> Once youâ€™ve completed your apprenticeship, youâ€™ll have a good idea of where you want to focus. For example, you could be a Design Engineer, Stress Engineer, Development Engineer or a Service Engineer.
00:23:40 <reification> nvq = not very qualified :p

00:24:00 <DoT_> but reif, dont think that joke gets me to forgive you
00:24:33 <skram> so if you do land said apprenticeship, will they also give you a job?
00:24:37 <reification> nvq is the vocational track, where level 4 is degree eqivilent i think?
00:24:47 <DoT_> yes skram apprentichips lead to jobs
00:24:54 <skram> neat

00:27:31 <reification> ah level 4 is between degree and a-level
00:28:02 <DuB`> Hah, I knew it!
00:28:16 <DuB`> It's not even a finance thing, it's Management Accounting.
00:28:17 <DuB`> ez
00:28:36 <skram> would that not be a part of finance
00:28:48 <DoT_> not even worth doing its so easy dub
00:28:55 <DuB`> Well they're different degrees.
00:29:30 <DoT_> well that is the apprentiship route dub, they genraly work diffren
00:29:31 <DoT_> t
00:29:45 <skram> but accounting would be considered a part of finance as a field y/n?
00:29:49 <DuB`> Uh.
00:30:00 <DuB`> Dunno.
00:30:06 <DoT_> skram, its just like dub claims there is not maths in accounting
00:30:20 <DuB`> At my uni the finance majors are all the ones who didn't make it into accounting. :P
00:30:25 <DuB`> Keheh
00:30:33 <skram> spreadsheets is not math i think DoT_
00:30:57 <DoT_> depends what you do with them
00:32:06 <DuB`> Management accounting like that position is definitely one of the more interesting accounting paths, though.
00:32:14 <DuB`> Far removing from dumb bookkeeping 'n stuff.
00:33:50 <skram> When you do land this gig, you should be a stress engineer dot
00:33:55 <skram> you already have heaps of experience

01:06:16 <DoT_> i am in bed
01:25:22 <Camail> skram pls
01:25:27 <Camail> is bio ded
01:25:34 <motbob> does anyone want to help me start a conspiracy theory?
01:25:51 <DuB`> Sounds fun.
01:26:04 <DoT_> gladly when i am awake
01:26:28 <motbob> All right, let me lay it out, then
01:27:25 <motbob> As everyone knows, sugar is bad for you. It causes long-term health problems and short-term lethargy.
01:28:03 <motbob> It's especially not good for kids because it conditions them to eat a lot (since it's way easier to eat a lot of cheap carbs than a lot of other foods)
01:28:42 <motbob> Yet, in the 50s/60s, a bunch of government-funded studies placed long-term health blame on other types of food--namely fats, especially saturated fats
01:28:56 <motbob> You can google and find a few recent articles on this phenomenon
01:29:13 <motbob> Basically, that wasn't a scientific mistake, but a government conspiracy
01:29:32 <Camail> wait i thought simple carbs gave you short term energy, but the ATP to ADP reaction was more inefficient
01:30:04 <motbob> i think the crash makes it a bad tradeoff, but that's just my person opinion. Ahem, I mean, it's SCIENTIFIC FACt
01:30:45 <Camail> sCiEnTiFiC
01:31:14 <motbob> The government has an interest in creating a permanent underclass. Failing to condemn sugary foods helps the government do that because (1) sugary foods are often the ones poor people can afford and (2) those exact foods stunt kids' growth, intellectually as well as physically
01:31:58 <motbob> This also has the added benefit of killing off people at or near retirement age, due to the heart disease associated with sugary foods (saves gov't money on social programs)
01:32:24 <Camail> high fructose corn syrup subsidies!
01:32:25 <motbob> uhh I had more Ironclad Evidence but I forgot
01:32:26 <Camail> THE PIECES
01:32:27 <motbob> YES
01:32:30 <Camail> ARE COMING TOGETHERRRRR
01:33:16 <DuB`> America = CORN
01:33:26 <motbob> with low overall energy levels, people who eat sugary foods aren't able to achieve anything outside of their worker bee life--they go home and collapse, brain dead
01:33:59 <motbob> anyway, I came up with this theory because I've been eating more sugar than normal lately and I've been feeling really lethargic
01:34:19 <Camail> other than that football player, Mr. OchoCinco, who literally lived off of McDonalds
01:34:29 <Camail> but yea diet sucks
01:34:39 <Camail> it IS a pretty low key shitty part about being poor
01:34:44 <Camail> other than just not having ANY food
01:35:00 <Camail> though there's a ton of resources on the internet now about cheap living
01:35:07 <Camail> rice kinda ruins this plan
01:41:40 <motbob> in the end, a theory that the gov't wants to make its citizens *less* productive is stupid on its face--the most plausible "conspiracy theory," after all, is the idea that the government's arguments against pot legalization are overblown and that the true reason behind it is related to productivity
01:42:12 <motbob> for further reading on this theory, please read "Top Secret," the most subversive children's book in history
01:45:58 <motbob> looks like the book's author's wikipedia page was edited by one of his young fans https://i.gyazo.com/2c89df54e45c2f798602052db35434b4.png
01:47:45 <Bio> asdf
01:48:24 <Cane> Overwatch tourney things. https://www.twitch.tv/carbonentertainment TeamLiquid vs LG Loyal.
01:53:02 <motbob> The main character invents a pill that can turn people into plants so that they can get sustenance from the sun/soil. But then The Government shows up.
01:53:08 <motbob> https://i.gyazo.com/40ee462131f523b447629b634d4c6755.jpg
01:53:15 <motbob> https://i.gyazo.com/a65b9d91f6658a2b32a662e38e8a655e.png
01:54:06 <motbob> This is *basically* a direct parallel to government interests in opposition to pot (replace the "food industry" with the part of the pharmecutical industry that deals with pain relief)
01:54:41 <motbob> i saw this book everywhere when I was a kid
01:57:09 <Camail> that wikipedia edit is adorable
01:59:17 <Bio> Bio ate himself. to death.

09:52:27 <Dot`> i dont know!
09:52:37 <Dot`> but there was one we had hopes for when it got finished
09:52:46 <Cane> Call of Chernobyl has more working add-ons now, I've been meaning to check out Warfare.
09:52:46 <Dot`> was it the Arma 3 one?
09:53:01 <Dot`> or was it warfare
09:53:04 <Dot`> could be
09:53:23 <Cane> Well, Arma's stalker mod might be awesome once that comes out but that'll still take a while.
09:53:26 <Cane> Gunslinger is the other big one.
09:53:54 <Cane> That's the one that should breathe some life into the game.
09:54:07 <Cane> It's out of hiatus (again) but no ETA as far as I know.

Nov 30 03:49:59 fremont poll up your friend list with helpful/strong players and clear the story scenarios, start collecting fusion materials for dark ifrit, and start building up your giants team.
22:13:58 <Zounds> I see!
22:15:06 <DuB`> Ehhh nevermind, this guide is awful.
22:15:07 <DuB`> Haha
22:15:32 <Zounds> hah
22:19:09 <DuB`> Aha! https://summonerswar.co/summoners-war-progression-guide/
22:19:10 <DuB`> Better.
22:20:05 <DuB`> Much simpler, and the giants guide linked there is perfect.
22:20:52 <Zounds> Thanks brosef
22:26:52 <Zounds> good to know the general direction to go in, so I can be sure i'm not wasting time and resources :P
22:27:02 <DuB`> Yup yup
22:27:25 <DuB`> As for resources, another good habit is to always spend your arena glory on devilmon FIRST every week as they refresh.
22:27:33 <DuB`> And save them for you strong monsters later on.
22:27:48 <Zounds> Sounds good
22:28:01 <DuB`> Or give them to me. ;D
22:28:03 <DuB`> I wish...
22:28:06 <Zounds> D:
22:28:47 <Zounds> I've got a couple of rainbowmon too
22:28:59 <Zounds> But I read to just hang on to them and use them during evolution
22:29:34 <Bio> yeh
22:30:03 <DuB`> Use them for any evolution your doing - they're not really rare/valuable. 
22:30:06 <DuB`> Just fodder!
22:30:11 <DuB`> you're*
22:30:24 <Zounds> Aye, i've not actually evolved anything yet but that should happen tonight or tomorrow morning
22:30:42 <DuB`> Save red crystals to buy the 750 premium pack and summon stuff.
22:30:56 <DuB`> And get awesome stuff like bio. :P
22:31:37 <Zounds> I tend to be pretty lucky in RNG
22:31:43 <Zounds> So maybe it works out for me in this game too :P
22:32:07 <Zounds> I did get 2x3 star monsters from 8 unkown scrolls earlier
22:32:08 <DuB`> Mhmm
22:32:26 <DuB`> Ah! If you can, hop in chat channel 1001 right now so I can be your mentor.
22:32:37 <DuB`> Then you can use my rep TWICE per day.
22:32:38 <Zounds> Sure 2 secs
22:32:57 <Zounds> He's a beefy guy, used him to pwn something earlier for fun
22:33:22 <Zounds> was extreme overkill to say the least
22:33:57 <DuB`> He can probably do up to giants 6 or so solo, even.
22:34:48 <Zounds> where would i see the mentor notification
22:35:12 <DuB`> Community, friends tab
22:35:20 <DuB`> I dunno, never been on the mentee side. :P

23:46:05 <motbob> the bus was coming in 8 minutes. I knew I had time to pee before I left to catch it. But then, when I was peeing, I felt like I needed to poop, too. I gave in to the urge and missed the bus, and I had to drive to school and pay $6 parking. Thus my poop cost $6.
23:49:08 <Phearlock> Was it worth it though? It sounds like it was
23:50:22 <skram> i'd pay 6$ for not having to sit on a bus while in dire need of a poop
23:51:11 <motbob> i feel like I wasn't able to achieve mind over matter
23:54:48 <DoT_> whats up all
23:55:27 <DoT_> Good luck dubs
