00:56:08 * Bio hugs Dot` 
00:56:16 <Dot`> Hey pon
00:56:18 <Bio> i actually hate algorithms
00:56:24 <Bio> verymuch
00:57:29 <Dot`> haha, understandable
00:58:40 <Camail> i hate doing algorithm analysis, the algorithms themselves are fine they didnt hurt me
00:58:50 <Camail> but fuck all the math and stats, god i hate it it's so boring
00:59:02 <Camail> so yea, we we should ban them from the world
01:15:54 <DuB`> Ban ALL math
01:15:56 <DuB`> Even better.
01:17:08 <DuB`> OWL is pretty impressive
01:17:12 <Camail> no, normal math is good
01:17:30 <DuB`> Nuh uh
01:17:34 <DuB`> Math is the worst
01:17:34 <Camail> math in computer science is what sucks
01:18:07 <DuB`> Cam, all my professors for next semester are in a panic.
01:18:14 <Camail> no money?
01:18:27 <DuB`> LIterally every tax textboox is going to be obsolete the week before the semester starts.
01:18:33 <Camail> lul
01:18:48 <Camail> do they give people a chance to look at the new stuff tho
01:18:52 <Camail> that seems necessary
01:19:10 <Camail> but yea, shit sucks
01:19:14 <Camail> but there is a good flow chart
01:19:14 <DuB`> Ye, we've spent the entire last week in my research class just going over the current house/senate versions of the reform.
01:19:23 <DuB`> It's so scummy rofl
01:19:36 <Camail> just ask "did this law help people or hurt them" 
01:19:42 <Camail> and if it hurts people, that's the new law
01:20:39 <DuB`> Is the S in USA now the S of S/M?
01:20:51 <Camail> we live with the modern day Caliligula 
01:21:02 <DuB`> :T
01:21:03 <Camail> and i dont usually kink shame
01:21:19 <Camail> but this kind of financial domination is kinda ruining the mood
01:21:48 <DuB`> This and net neutrality at the same time has me pretty hopeless, sheesh
01:22:11 <DuB`> Gotta look at the positives... we got Ol' Musky doin' good
01:22:39 <DuB`> Cool stuff in science (just not environmental science) right now, etc.
01:22:58 <Camail> so anything the govt cant touch yet
01:24:27 <Camail> also the travel ban being in affect again
01:24:41 <Camail> thats a low key shit sandwich i didnt see a lot about
