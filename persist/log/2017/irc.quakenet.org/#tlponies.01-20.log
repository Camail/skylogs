14:12:11 <Yolteotl> xD
14:12:13 <Yolteotl> <3
14:12:39 <ZK> considering in 70 games, ive played 6 protoss, theres a lot of TvT
14:16:06 <Yolteotl> my current ratio (only 35 games this season) is
14:16:22 <Yolteotl> vP 33% vT 58% vZ 45%
14:16:23 <Yolteotl> :D
14:16:28 <Yolteotl> I don't play enough
14:18:01 <ZK> i hadnt played 70 games in a season in while
14:18:15 <ZK> i want to play more protoss :(
14:18:30 <ZK> whenever i play one, im so happy
14:23:36 <Yolteotl> I always prefered TvT over all MU :p
14:23:43 <Yolteotl> only the best one win
14:24:05 <Yolteotl> Terran doesn't have cheated units like Protoss and Zerg :D:D

16:39:07 <Phearlock> Shields are great
16:39:27 <Dot`> but they weigh like 6 pounds and cost 10 gold!
16:39:57 <Phearlock> By the time we get to a store, I think you'll have 10 gold to spare.
16:40:00 <Dot`> so I am happy to get one form a dead elf
16:40:00 <ZK> skram keeps all the gold
16:40:02 <ZK> such a dwarf
