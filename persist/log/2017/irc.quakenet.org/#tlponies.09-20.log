01:10:36 <Crisium> omg
01:10:37 <Crisium> omg
01:10:44 <Crisium> this bw game in asl from yesterday
01:10:49 <Crisium> its only starting
01:10:50 <Crisium> but
01:10:52 <Crisium> the builds
01:10:56 <Crisium> i cant believe this is pro bw
01:11:01 <Crisium> guys
01:11:04 <Crisium> Corsairs
01:11:04 <Crisium> and
01:11:06 <Crisium> Ghosts
01:11:10 <Dot`> nice
01:11:13 <Dot`> .tell skram https://imgur.com/gallery/KbT6k
01:11:24 <Crisium> i hope this game is good, because this does not make sense
01:12:27 <Crisium> PvT does not have corsairs
01:12:30 <Crisium> ghosts are never made period
01:12:32 <Crisium> hnggg
01:13:15 <Crisium> hahaha
01:13:45 <Crisium> Rain vs Ample
01:13:46 <Crisium> https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=lu0VVj1BMu8&t=1h43m38s
01:14:01 <Crisium> i hope its good, cause so far it is just the most odd thing i have ever seen
01:14:30 <Bio> ghosts make nukes happen
01:15:29 <Crisium> ghosts are useing lockdown on corsairs
01:15:42 <Crisium> i can safely say that hasnt happened in a pro game in decades
01:15:59 <Bio> but, y corsairs tho
01:16:11 <Crisium> d-web on tanks
01:16:13 <Crisium> its legit
01:16:17 <Bio> lel
01:16:28 <Bio> I suppose like 2 or three would be eh
01:16:46 <Crisium> i have seen corsairs in pro BW before for PvT
01:16:59 <Crisium> but like once every 2 years
01:17:00 <Crisium> its that rare
01:17:35 <Crisium> so the T scouted fleat beacon and assumed carriers so he went ghost
01:17:47 <Crisium> but plot twist, the fleat beacon was for d-web
01:17:51 <Crisium> fleet?
01:17:57 <Crisium> yes english is hard
01:18:27 <Crisium> lockdown vs carriers is also ultra rare, once every few years thing
01:18:42 <Crisium> this game is literally one in several thousand chance of happening
01:18:47 <Crisium> if not 1 in tens of thousands
01:18:55 <Crisium> possible more rare than that
01:19:26 <Crisium> i dont want to oversell it because it may not be the best game even on this day, but the rarity is unprecidented
01:20:32 <Crisium> its like hive tech zvz rare, but even rarer
01:20:53 <Bio> I mean, i'm familiar with bw, its just been a while
01:21:05 <Bio> and yeah, hive zvz lel
01:22:00 <Crisium> "never would i have guessed i would have cast a game like this in ASL ever, never ever ever ever" "20 years from now I would be that not how it works like this man"

01:26:09 <Crisium> day9 been doing tons of bw vids
01:26:17 <Crisium> glad hes back in his OG game
01:26:45 <Crisium> casting Shine too, one of the most underrated zergs ever
01:26:55 <Crisium> went from commentator to second place in ASL
01:27:29 <Crisium> and back in pro-BW he was actually #1 in ELO once
01:28:27 <Crisium> shine's asl run last season had moments that blew my mind
01:28:41 <Crisium> guardian + hydra build to bust a terran front, amazing
01:29:58 <Camail> i wish he'd play it more instead of just teaching it
01:31:52 <Crisium> might be just way to rusty
01:32:09 <Bio> prolly
01:32:46 <Camail> god, taking a management course has thoroughly convinced me that i hate being a manager
01:32:48 <Crisium> tastosis were always better actual players, day9 understood the game best but didnt have the physical abilities for it

13:55:16 <ZK> boiled fish?
13:55:20 <ZK> Does that taste good?
13:55:31 <skram> i even sold my still
13:55:41 <skram> eh, its not that good honestly
13:56:21 <ZK> So why do it? :o
13:56:34 <reification> probably trying to be healthy
13:56:46 <skram> ya
13:56:49 <ZK> Good!
13:56:58 <ZK> What spices you add to fish?
13:57:00 <reification> lots of omega 3 for brain power
13:57:12 <skram> need dat vitamin d for the dark season
13:57:22 <skram> ...salt?
13:57:37 <skram> and some carrots?
13:57:52 <reification> you should get good salt like himalayan pink salt skram
13:58:43 <skram> i dont think you are able to get that in stores here reif
14:01:17 <ZK> Lemon juice and oregano with some olive oil might give it a better taste!
14:01:32 <ZK> Or maybe try it with oregano, garlic, basil and some dices tomatoes
14:01:45 <ZK> still very healthy, will give it some kick
14:01:47 <skram> ooh
14:02:01 <ZK> chili powder with some lime is also good mix
14:02:18 <skram> these are good ideas
14:02:23 <ZK> Yay!
14:02:30 <ZK> Spices are great, make any meal taste so much better
14:02:59 <reification> i would expect you need to supplement vit d 
14:03:15 <reification> gonna be hard to get it all thru food unless you are secretly a cat
14:03:53 <skram> Yeah, I do take vitamin D supplements and bloodwork once a year
