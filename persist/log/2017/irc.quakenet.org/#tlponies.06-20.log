12:55:32 <reification> be careful not to tire yourself out with that hectic schedule :p
12:55:48 <reification> .roll d20 to boop the lazy zk
12:56:03 <ZK> old school revival, it's the 70s RPing, but with some modern stuff to make it better
12:56:21 <ZK> so basically in the 70s characters were just regular dudes
12:56:35 <ZK> that somehow explored dungeons, and then became stronger
12:56:51 <ZK> so I made 4 characters, fully expecting most of them to die
12:57:28 <ZK> one is a gravedigger, other is a herder, a trader and a stonemason
12:58:28 <Dot`> ah cool
13:10:48 <ZK> what are your plans Dot`?

13:11:21 <Dot`> i gamed a bit of factorio with my bro, but he is asleep now

13:16:21 <Dot`> i just want to play dnd 5e with friends zk, but work keeps getting in peoples way
13:16:50 <ZK> force bio to DM!

13:17:18 <ZK> did you try the stick poking?
13:17:56 <Dot`> my stick doesnt reach that far D:
13:19:00 <ZK> Well, if you want, I could run a module around this time for the next couple months. I don't have a job, so that means I have most days free around now for about 8 hours most weekdays. Would just need 2 or hopefully 3 more players
13:20:06 <Dot`> wonder who in tlp we could lure in
13:20:15 <ZK> reification?
13:20:32 <reification> prob not

13:22:17 <Dot`> lol
13:22:55 <Dot`> i read sometihng about a month ago saying if you plan to run that campaghn its best to do away with the start
13:22:59 <Dot`> when you have new players
13:23:35 <ZK> get right into the thick of it?
13:24:26 <Dot`> the beggning investigation part is apparenlty a biti long and requirers experience with DnD to understand how to proceed
13:27:35 <Dot`> is dub on holiday soon? or about to start a new year
13:27:47 <Dot`> he was signing up for courses yesterday, maybe he has free time
13:43:52 <Dot`> Are you sure about this offer zk, your not too fond of 5e from what you have said before
13:44:50 <reification> https://twitter.com/robertoglezcano/status/876202209154920448
