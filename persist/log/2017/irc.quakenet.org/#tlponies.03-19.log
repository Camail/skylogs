13:11:35 <Yolteotl> and 210hp is very fun to use
13:16:02 <skram> I learnt to drive in a 200hp audi quattro Yolteotl
13:16:10 <Yolteotl> you know Peugeot will be the mid-high brand of PSA ? 
13:16:18 <skram> That was a fun time, despite its many many faults

13:29:25 <Yolteotl> if you want, I'll sell my DS4 in 2 / 3 years <3

13:32:37 <Zounds> I've considered playing more rectangle man but I think I'd rather play in a duo if I was going to play him
13:32:40 <tredc> SoulKey!!
13:33:21 <Zounds> Though I've only played ~15 matches including placements this season I've only been "forced" to play rein once
