00:03:47 <Camail> dot did you win yet
00:04:42 <Dot`> wrist was sore today and I was not home much so not yet
00:05:14 <Camail> but at least you progressed 
00:05:20 <Camail> explore the area at all?
00:07:07 <Dot`> yea i found white knight but dont have strong enough magic ghost sword or somethning
00:07:13 <Dot`> and found needle lady again
00:07:29 <Dot`> and talked to giant bug about wyrm
00:07:32 <Dot`> that was confusing
00:07:53 <Camail> did you find his butt
00:08:15 <Dot`> i found that ages ago...
00:08:22 <Dot`> i am uncomfortable
00:09:45 <Camail> you found the big bug's butt before talking to him?
00:10:01 <Camail> you should go back to him and dream nail him
00:10:04 <Dot`> yea, i found the way there back before i went to the sanctum
00:10:31 <Dot`> oh right
00:10:39 <Dot`> he wasnt dead so it didnt ocur to me
00:11:09 <Dot`> oh and i explored the hive today
00:11:16 <Camail> oh good
00:11:21 <Camail> was worried you wouldnt find it
00:11:55 <Camail> that should give you a bit more lore
00:12:09 <Camail> its pretty subtle, but neat
00:12:37 <Dot`> im good at finding hidden places and ways, bad at following the main route apparently
00:12:44 <Dot`> too busy poking around corners
00:13:32 <Camail> which entrance did you use tog et into the doublejump place, the lower one or the higher one
00:13:58 <Camail> i actually did both but was too nervous to fully explore either for awhile
00:14:05 <Camail> burned the wick at both ends
00:14:05 <Dot`> one only opens form the inside through that place you have to use a large bee to break into
00:14:22 <Camail> i meant double jump place not hive
00:14:25 <Dot`> 1 goes in a bit but you cant reach the actual hive, that i found ages ago
00:14:28 <Dot`> then 2 others
00:14:32 <Camail> but yea i accidently found the hive
00:14:37 <Dot`> i found the double jump one first
00:14:38 <Camail> i soul blasted some bees out of rage
00:14:53 <Dot`> second*
00:14:53 <Camail> there's multiple ways into the basin, dot
00:14:57 <Camail> oh lol
00:14:59 <Camail> freudian slip
00:15:01 <Camail> without the dicks
00:15:10 <Dot`> across the spike pit?
00:15:29 <Camail> there's one from above, then there's a horizontal one from below
00:15:31 <Dot`> the bthere are multiple ways into everywhere
00:15:34 <Camail> obviously avoiding names
00:15:50 <Dot`> like i fell into the deepness long before i fought the mantis
00:16:12 <Camail> i took a relatively normal path through the game
00:16:54 <Dot`> i wish i had
00:17:21 <Camail> meh, everyone's different
00:17:49 <Camail> soul sanctum was kind of a bitch,  did that before i got any nail upgrades
00:18:09 <Camail> i had an idea where the first 8 or so hours would go, tho
00:18:13 <Camail> because i watched a stream of it
00:18:54 <Dot`> i first started doing it without, then i got to that knight person, had a very long fight but died to him
00:19:05 <Dot`> so went exploring a bit and during that got the upgrade
00:19:12 <Dot`> was easy when i  went back to him
00:20:39 <Dot`> did you kill the ghosts in the grove? i dont want to D:
00:20:50 <Dot`> cookie bug is adorable
00:22:44 <Dot`> is it like annother challange arena basicly? or is it a "how much of a bastard can you be" test
00:23:32 <Camail> i killed them all
00:23:38 <Camail> even the younglings
00:23:44 <Dot`> D:
00:23:47 <Dot`> AMG
00:23:53 <Dot`> EVEN COOKIE BUG?
00:24:00 <Camail> all of them
00:24:03 <Dot`> ...
00:24:10 <Camail> i let them sleep
00:24:14 <Camail> they were in a constant dream
00:24:21 <Dot`> i mean if it brings back a friend for the stag then gladly
00:24:21 <Camail> also i dislike KS backers in games
00:24:27 <Dot`> but otherwise, you monster
00:24:44 <Dot`> oh? those are backer items?
00:24:53 <Camail> it screams fan design
00:24:54 <Camail> pls
00:24:57 <Dot`> like get your personal ghost if you pay X
00:24:57 <Camail> just read any of it
00:25:11 <Camail> 100%
00:25:15 <Dot`> well i did not know this game was KS
00:25:21 <Camail> i didnt
00:25:22 <Camail> still dont
00:25:25 <Dot`> i thought it was just really random
00:25:34 <Camail> but as soon as i saw it, it screamed backer support
00:25:45 <Camail> also the credits has backers in it
00:25:51 <Camail> thats another hint
00:25:56 <Dot`> hmmm
00:26:42 <Dot`> then they may all die
00:26:45 <Dot`> again
00:27:10 <Camail> i played "solemn reaper" mode
00:27:25 <Camail> killed every ghost
00:27:31 <Camail> ended all suffering
00:27:34 <Camail> it gets hard
00:28:05 <reification> night all
00:28:05 <Dot`> i felt bad when i hit the bee lady and she faded instead of just saying something
00:28:09 <Dot`> gnight reif
00:28:15 <Camail> cya reif
00:28:16 <Camail> dont die
00:28:18 <Camail> yet
00:28:37 <Camail> well dot, dreaming seems to suck in this world
00:28:43 <Camail> no one knows they're dead
00:28:53 <Dot`> everything sucks!
00:29:00 <Camail> did you visit miner bug
00:29:04 <Dot`> my heart is in constant pain
00:29:14 <Dot`> YOU KNOW I DID
00:29:20 <Camail> again?
00:29:25 <Dot`> i should go see her again
00:29:28 <Camail> yea
00:29:30 <Camail> you should
00:30:30 <Camail> is the input lag still there?
00:30:39 <Camail> I'd be surprised, given how many optimizations
00:31:18 <Dot`> i tihnk its a mixture of certain things cause you to not be able to do other things and me being bad
00:31:36 <Dot`> but it feels better after update, or im getting use to it
00:32:02 <Camail> probably a bit of both
00:44:07 <Dot`> you finished downloading samurai jack yet cam
00:44:16 <Camail> yea hours ago >_>
00:44:20 <Camail> I'LL DO IT GEEZ DAD
00:44:34 <Dot`> AND watched them?
00:44:42 <Dot`> CLAMS PLS
00:46:17 <Camail> THEY'RE MY CLAMS
00:46:22 <Camail> I JUST GOT THEM BACK FROM DUB
00:46:27 <Camail> WHICH TOOK FAR TOO LONG
00:54:55 <Dot`> you should not trust dub with clams

16:00:47 <motbob> we'll find out on april 11 i guess
16:01:03 <motbob> (yooka-laylee release date)
16:02:07 <Bio> I think it can hold up
16:02:20 <motbob> from the footage of that game that I've seen, it doesn't really try to update game design principles from 1998
16:03:56 <Bio> though it will be interesting to see if nostalgia overpowers what gamers want nowadays or vice versa

22:07:05 <DoT`> he so dead
22:07:14 <DoT`> and wont talk to me through ghost sword
22:07:18 <DoT`> its better this way
22:07:30 <Camail> did you dream nail him before you killed him
22:07:40 <DoT`> no, he was attackign me
22:07:46 <Camail> well
22:07:49 <Camail> I'll have you know
22:07:52 <Camail> that his last thought
22:08:00 <Camail> his last thought that was his own, fighting against the light
22:08:01 <DoT`> oh, ive tried it with others alive and its never done anything
22:08:03 <Camail> it was the song
22:08:12 <DoT`> awwwwwww
22:08:15 <Camail> gasping in his own mind
22:08:20 <Camail> desperately trying to complete that verse
22:08:30 <Camail> imprisoned in his own fungal body
22:08:45 <Camail> its 100% unique dialog

22:09:15 <DuB`> D:
22:09:25 <Camail> dub you should play
22:14:34 <ZK> what game this?
22:15:18 <Camail> hollow knight
22:16:11 <DoT`> zk, its good, like bridge to terabithia
22:17:51 <Camail> OH SHIT DS3 DLC
22:17:56 <Camail> i didnt even realize
22:18:00 <Camail> i went dark on all spoilers
22:18:09 <Camail> well, tried to
22:18:21 <Camail> i have a bad habit of rememering things when i explicitly dont want to
22:18:28 <Camail> the more i dont want to remember, the more baked in it gets
22:18:47 <Camail> i can finally resubscribe to like 4 channels
22:19:37 <ZK> bridge to terabithia was a good movie
22:19:45 <ZK> so you're telling me to play this DoT`?
22:20:43 <ZK> the map looks metroid like
22:21:37 <Camail> its a metroidvania
22:21:41 <Camail> less vania than metroid
22:21:53 <Camail> 85% metroid
22:22:02 <Camail> but imagine if metroid games had good story
22:22:06 <Camail> and characters
22:22:07 <ZK> ooooooooohhhh
22:22:09 <ZK> that sounds good
22:22:21 <ZK> you guys seem to think it's hard, or you guys talking about the story?
22:22:35 <Camail> also its on GoG so you can pirate it and test out the first hour
22:22:49 <Camail> its difficulty depends on if you are already good at platformers
22:23:02 <ZK> i beat ori! so im not really that good
22:23:07 <ZK> but we'll see
22:23:15 <Camail> if you are good at paltformers its easy, if you are new its a good difficulty curve
22:23:34 <Camail> have you played super meatboy?
22:23:47 <ZK> yep, made it towards final stages?
22:23:53 <Camail> the key to good platforming in hollow knight is mastery over your jump height
22:23:57 <ZK> oh kk
22:23:58 <Camail> which is a big part of smb
22:24:05 <Camail> so you should be fine
22:24:20 <Camail> there are a handful of other movement mechanics but thats the core
22:24:30 <Camail> and they use many familiar SMB tricks
22:24:46 <Camail> like dropping from a ledge to get under an obstacle
