00:00:33 <Dot`> there is SO MUCH lore dub
00:01:12 <Dot`> all you need to knw is chaos are bad and pointy, dark elves are sissys, Orkz ar de best
00:01:30 <Dot`> humans are pretty screwed
00:01:34 <DuB`> I see.
00:01:36 <Dot`> i think that covers it Bio?
00:01:57 <DuB`> But what if I LIKE evil sadist-themed elvenfolk?
00:02:07 <Dot`> they too edgy
00:02:10 <Dot`> try hards
00:02:21 <Phearlock> 40k is a bit over the top
00:02:34 <Dot`> thats part if the fun phear
00:02:36 <Phearlock> It's funny grimdark typically, not serious grimdark
00:02:40 <Dot`> its grim AND dark
00:02:42 <Phearlock> And that's its style
00:06:21 <Dot`> why the intrest dub? are you talking table top, pc game, books
00:06:36 <DuB`> All the things!
00:06:53 <Dot`> oh dear, that is a lot
00:07:00 <DuB`> I've thought all of it is super cool for years but just didn't know much about any of it.
00:08:51 <Dot`> you played any of the pc games?
00:09:10 <DuB`> Naw
00:09:28 <DuB`> Watched a lot of one or two on strims.
00:10:58 <Bio> dub tyranids = zerg
00:11:06 <Dot`> this is true
00:11:20 <DuB`> I gathered as much. :P
00:12:03 <DuB`> Oooh
00:12:11 <DuB`> Vaults of Terra youtube channel seems perfect.
00:13:04 <Bio> Praise the emperor dub
00:13:14 <Dot`> you should probably start with the basic history of The impurim of man
00:13:24 <Bio> purge the heretics
00:13:39 <Dot`> covering the horus heresy 
00:13:50 <Dot`> thats kind of the base for the universe
00:15:09 <Camail> dot u need to watch this last episode
00:15:19 <Dot`> of crit rol?
00:15:21 <Bio> yeh dot
00:15:22 <Camail> yesterday was crazy crit role drama
00:15:27 <Bio> yeh
00:15:28 <DuB`> :O
00:15:38 <Dot`> i thought you said you where not even watchign it cam til it finished
00:15:40 <Camail> my vote is for you to get to the episdoe wehre they enter the final dungeon
00:15:43 <Camail> then skipp the rest
00:15:53 <Camail> we thought it was gonna end last night
00:15:58 <Camail> but no, its next week
00:16:14 <Camail> like, literally at the boss door
00:16:21 <Camail> no more stalling
00:16:27 <Bio> they spent 3h on one fite and 2h blabbing about what spells to cast
00:16:35 <Camail> which is appropriate
00:16:38 <Camail> i liked last episode
00:16:42 <Camail> its just the 3-4 before that
00:16:48 <Camail> were boring and nothing happened
00:17:02 <Camail> PLENTY of narrative progression this week tho
00:17:05 <Camail> too much, actually
00:17:13 <Camail> like, damn son
00:23:04 <DuB`> Oooh
00:23:07 <DuB`> F1 race this weekend.
00:27:01 <DuB`> Oke
00:27:02 <DuB`> So
00:27:08 <DuB`> Space Jesus
00:27:11 <Dot`> yes
00:27:16 <DuB`> And Judas Horus
00:27:23 <DuB`> I see I see
00:27:25 <Dot`> yes
00:27:37 <Dot`> and cockney orks
00:27:51 <DuB`> Better be careful 'round South London
00:27:59 <DuB`> Tau guys seems okay.
00:28:14 <Dot`> Tau are cool, all battlesuites and stuff
00:28:56 <DuB`> Dark eldar are like, sure being evil kinda ruined the universe but it's FUN so hey
00:30:29 <Dot`> no self control
00:31:36 <Dot`> litrally feeding an evil chaos god becuase selfish
00:33:18 <Dot`> all Elder wear souls stones becuase when they die slaanesh will try take thier soul and torture it for eternity
00:33:34 <Dot`> and then theres dark eldar that go out thier way to kill eachother
00:33:54 <DuB`> Kehe
00:35:53 <Dot`> One of the main themes of warhammer dub is kinf of religion if it had real world consequenses. 
00:36:12 <Dot`> like people who fall to temptation physicly mutate if they fall too far
00:36:24 <Dot`> "blessings of the chaos gods"
00:36:36 <Bio> aka purge the heretics
00:42:08 <Camail> space jesus but  like, even more powerful than if you put jesus in space
00:42:34 <Dot`> but yet stuck on a throne basicly dead
00:42:59 <Dot`> all he does is create a beacon that the imperial navy cna use to navigate the warp by
00:43:03 <Bio> But the EMPEROR'S WILL DOT
00:43:07 <Dot`> besides that useless!
00:43:11 <Dot`> :P
01:05:48 <Camail> Dot`  but thats just because horus ruined his birthday present to humanity
01:06:13 <Camail> he fucked up our macaroni art and the emperor had to perpetually hold it together
01:06:26 <Camail> i do kinda wish that the universe would enter the next arc tho
01:06:36 <Camail> like, have the emperor die and have shit happen
01:06:49 <Dot`> i was looking ealrier and some large changes seem to be happening
01:07:01 <Dot`> Cadia fell
01:07:08 <Camail> your mention of it caused me to do a quick 30 minute wiki dive
01:07:09 <Dot`> the eye is exapnding, ir has expanded
01:07:24 <Dot`> or*
01:07:36 <Camail> the part i just read is that the throne is dying and no one is smart enough to repair it
01:07:46 <Camail> because the dumb fucks banned learning new tech
01:07:56 <Dot`> well yea, they lost the knowledge 
01:08:07 <Camail> i dunno if they ever knew
01:08:23 <Dot`> now passwords are only known as hyms and religious phrases
01:08:31 <Camail> they found old alien shit and duct taped their stuff onto it
01:08:44 <Camail> two factor authentication was never used, apparently
01:08:51 <Camail> stupid aliens are gonna get us socially engineered
01:09:30 <DuB`> :P
01:09:39 <DuB`> Adeptus mechanicus, I just learned about that!
01:09:42 <DuB`> They have big robits.
01:09:52 <Dot`> it was years ago i read about it, its all human tech
01:12:55 <Dot`> http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Age_of_Technology
01:13:02 <Dot`> kind of mentiones it
01:13:07 <Dot`> but not what i was looking for
01:13:17 <Camail> ah, the wording of the page i was reading was weird
01:13:42 <Camail> was talking about ancient ones and it seemed to me the pre-elder beings
01:13:46 <Camail> but that was just for the web
01:19:57 <Camail> ok so i thought the emperor being in a cage fighting deamons for 10k years was like, harrowing, but he's literally like 50k years old or something
01:20:03 <Camail> thats a bit...weird
01:20:44 <Dot`> yea, the early years lore for wh40k gets a bit weird at times
01:20:59 <Dot`> stuff like the origin of the emporer
01:21:45 <Dot`> the elder beings
01:22:33 <Dot`> i think its meant to be more interpreted like old testemenr scripture kind of stuff
01:22:52 <Bio> so dub when are you gonna spend 10k dollarydoos on models?
01:24:13 <Camail> apparently most of the emp's backgorund story was retconned because gee its dumb
01:24:47 <Camail> maybe dont be a reincarnated neo-lithic shaman who has lived through all of human history
01:31:31 <Dot`> haha yea, i recall reading that and just wondering who thought it was a good idea
01:31:41 <Dot`> sleep time
01:31:48 <DuB`> Aw
01:31:51 <DuB`> G'night
01:31:52 <Dot`> maybe crit roll tomorow
01:32:23 <Dot`> remember dub, orks ar de bestest and most stompy
01:35:05 <Bio> daka daka we dem boyz
02:49:31 <Bio> dub
02:50:10 <DuB`> bio
02:50:15 <Bio> hilo
02:50:19 <DuB`> henlu
02:50:55 <Bio> i got a dark reaper
02:50:59 <Bio> neato
02:51:12 <Bio> lanett got the buff
02:51:17 <Bio> so i made her 6
02:53:02 <DuB`> She'll be kinda cool on despair for ToA now with all those DoTs.
02:54:47 <Bio> how goes the wh40k
02:55:39 <DuB`> I watched many viddy-o's
02:55:57 <Bio> are you ready to drop the dollarydoos and make minis
02:55:58 <Bio> =D
02:56:03 <DuB`> Haha
02:56:07 <DuB`> Maybe in 2yrs
02:56:17 <DuB`> I don't even know how the game works, so... not yet no. :P
02:56:29 <DuB`> I'll go watch some games 'n stuff sometime.
02:59:00 <Bio> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qJKPnAj_2E
02:59:03 <Bio> enjoy
02:59:36 <DuB`> Ooh
02:59:39 <Bio> rules aren't complicated
02:59:52 <DuB`> No eldar or zerg, pfffff
02:59:53 <Bio> but there are like hundreds of weaps/armors and stuffz
03:00:01 <Bio> PLS DUB
03:00:08 <Bio> just look at related vids
03:04:19 <DuB`> Later! :P
03:11:14 <DuB`> Just did my light paladin fusion... too bad she's not even gud. :P
03:54:07 <Camail> i briefly tried fortnite BR
03:54:22 <Camail> i dont think i can play any shooter other than csgo
03:54:34 <Camail> i think....i might hate all other kinds of shooting
03:54:45 <DuB`> That seems unfortunate.
03:54:49 <Camail> none of it is as fined tuned, and my tastes are so specific
03:54:59 <Camail> i dont think its a godo thing
03:55:03 <Camail> i dont think its a bad thing either
03:55:12 <Camail> but its more interesting than anything else
03:57:18 <Camail> there are some games that are so nuanced and shape the way you think about a set of mechanics that there is no room for anything else
03:58:10 <Camail> part of it is also that the spray rng is really aggressive in fortnite, so it might just be that the shooting in that game is objectively bad

22:47:18 <Camail> but with a early 20th century Disney aesthetic 
22:47:34 <Camail> the animation is god tier and the boss designs are god tier
22:48:05 <Camail> then the boss phase transitions are mega god tier
22:48:20 <Camail> its not my kind of game at all cuz its 90% bosses and i like feeling immersed
22:48:29 <Camail> but just looking at this game is damn near perfect
22:48:57 <Camail> 2017 is probably the best year in gaming history
