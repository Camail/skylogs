22:29:50 <Dot`> my internet just keeps dropping recently
22:45:02 <Camail> its going well, playing now actually
22:45:17 <Camail> the only real problem with the game on tactician mode is you cant casually walk around
22:45:31 <Camail> and they dont give you a good group formation tool like pillars does
22:45:56 <Camail> so you go "oops wandered into a battle, time for them to use all their AOEs and kill me"
22:46:04 <Camail> so it kinda ruins the immersion
22:46:24 <Camail> but all the non-combat parts are 9/10 at least
22:46:30 <Camail> and the combat itself is fun most of the time
22:46:39 <Camail> and it only gets more fun as you get more tools
22:52:41 <Dot`> cool
23:08:03 <Camail> Dot`  ruptured tendons + chicken claw is fucking broken
23:08:18 <Camail> chicken claw turns them into a  chicken and they run away
23:08:31 <Camail> ruptured tendon deals direct hp damage every time they move
23:08:38 <Dot`> ...
23:08:42 <Dot`> poor things
23:08:47 <Camail> no fuck them they suck
23:09:01 <Camail> they deserve to be turns into a chicken and forced to commit suicide
