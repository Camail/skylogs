03:07:39 <Micen> Camail crit role nowish
03:07:46 <Camail> exactly nowish
03:08:40 <Camail> i made a point of leaving the stream on
03:09:32 <Micen> just looking out since you missed part of last weeks
03:09:43 <Micen> i got your back
03:12:59 <ZK> semester started and tests?
03:13:05 <ZK> you need different school dub
03:13:25 <DuB`> There are schools without midterms? >_>
03:13:34 <ZK> why are your midterms so early
03:13:38 <ZK> mine arent for another 3 weeks
03:15:34 <Camail> trimesters maybe?
03:16:18 <DuB`> Yeh, two rounds of midterms and then finals.
03:16:39 <DuB`> I would die if all the content was only split up into two long blocks.
03:16:46 <motbob> i have had 1 midterm in law school total
03:16:47 <Camail> coward
03:16:48 <Camail> 1 test
03:16:50 <Camail> 1 grade
03:16:57 <motbob> ^ this is law school
03:17:24 <motbob> you sit down with no grade, 3 hours later you have your entire grade
03:18:11 <DuB`> I don't think even the MAcc here is like that.
03:18:16 <DuB`> Huh
03:18:30 <ZK> do they correct it after 3 hours immediately?
03:18:38 <motbob> i'm not sure why I don't find it stressful. maybe it's because I don't think about it. But now I'm thinking about it, thanks jerks
03:19:06 <DuB`> ;D
03:19:21 <ZK> it's ok, it's not for a while
03:19:34 <ZK> i probly need to do some work
03:19:45 <ZK> but then again, i'm only 3 weeks into the sesmester, and have done nothing
03:32:18 <Camail> Micen  WHY IS THIS SO SAD
03:32:37 <Micen> because.. it has to be
03:32:50 <DuB`> :o
03:34:09 <Micen> also because they are all actors and know how to treat the moment with the power it deserves
03:34:42 <Bio> TPK WHEN
03:34:57 <Micen> level 20 arc
03:35:02 <Camail> i dunno, they kinda killed a lot of very big things
03:35:07 <Camail> there's always big things tho
03:35:13 <Camail> always bigger and badder
03:35:14 <Micen> vecna arc i think
03:36:13 <Camail> who knows if VM will deal with vecna
03:36:43 <Camail> lvl 16 isn't quite demi-god level
03:36:53 <Micen> its going to be some downtime
03:37:20 <Micen> they still have city of brass, uhhh Jam'on's city to take the hand back to
03:37:36 <Camail> why go to city of brass?
03:37:43 <Camail> msut admit i was only barely paying attention to that detour
03:37:45 <Micen> they made a deal with whats his name
03:37:57 <Micen> the creepy guy who helped them get the plate armor
03:38:03 <Micen> that they owe him a favor
03:38:10 <Camail> damn
03:38:19 <Camail> sick rolls mercer
03:38:56 <Micen> holy..
03:38:59 <Micen> 2 nat 20s
03:40:09 <Micen> that d20 is intense. 
03:41:10 <Camail> I mean, the 20's were immaterial, but it was cool!
03:41:35 <Micen> its still uncanny 
03:42:04 <Camail> my favorite roll was stillt he double 20's of vex vs lady briarwood when vax almost died the very first time
03:42:14 <Micen> Yes
03:42:29 <Micen> Briarwood arc was so good. 
03:43:43 <Micen> i think, just because it felt so slightly different from everything else. Mercer is best when he is channeling that creepy vibe. 
04:59:45 <Bio> this is all fascinating
04:59:47 <Bio> but 
04:59:51 <Bio> T P K W H E N
05:00:06 <Micen> I dont think its going to happen. 
05:02:30 <Micen> Not going to lie, the thing that broke me down last week was grogs "Fix him." moment. 
05:50:21 <Camail> Tarrasque puts the T in TPK
06:09:25 <Micen> This is so much better now that we dont have a player death looming over us.

10:05:09 <Dot`> cane, the meta changed?
10:05:29 <Cane> It's in flux right now. People are still trying out new stuff. I expect we'll settle on a similar composition soon enough.
10:05:59 <Dot`> zounds will be happy
10:10:31 <Cane> Quad tank is falling out of favor because of the Ana nerf. 3 tank still alive and strong though, but we are seeing more 2-2-2 and the like.
10:11:02 <Dot`> i imagine dva nerf is playing a part
10:14:54 <Cane> See that?
10:15:11 <Cane> 2-2-2 or 3-tank is much more prevalent.
10:15:18 <Dot`> yea
10:15:46 <Dot`> 2-2-2 is nice becuase thats what stacks normaly end up as anyway
