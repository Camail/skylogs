03:47:44 <ZK> soundcloud doesn't let roll20 use them actually
03:47:52 <ZK> New rules of use
03:48:12 <Camail> thats...odd
03:48:15 <ZK> the jukebox is decent enough, but doesn't have as much as soundcloud
03:48:28 <Camail> is soundcloud owned by anyone big yet
03:49:15 <ZK> hm, nope, privately held company in germany
03:49:31 <DuB`> .tell reification I... like this a lot. Goodbook :D
03:49:50 <Camail> I wouldnt be surprised if they are positioning themselves to sell
03:50:09 <Camail> because they had no reason to care for like a year
03:50:18 <ZK> apparently the terms of use change was in 2015, but roll20 were allowed to keep using it until september, so yea...
03:50:36 <ZK> i dont know the big companies in europe though
03:54:35 <Camail> ZK if you are looking for an alternative, there looks to be a way to do it directly in discord? https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/3zg80a/easiest_way_to_play_music/
03:55:01 <Camail> its only the first result, but you can go down that line of tihnking
03:55:09 <ZK> yea, i'm trynig with a bot
03:55:21 <ZK> problem is that it takes 14 seconds between the click and when the song starts playing
03:55:28 <Camail> having a soundboard IN roll20 was so nice tho
03:55:53 <ZK> exactly, but they have like 200 or so tunes they provide, harder to search through them though
03:57:26 <ZK> found a cool list of sounds and music too, so 15 seconds is hopefully not the end of the world, or use something other than a bot
04:00:09 <Camail> is it loading the web page or something
04:00:12 <Camail> dunno why it takes so long
04:00:35 <Camail> with that much delay there has to be a reason
04:01:25 <ZK> yea, i think its the bot loading the web page, and since i dont have my own server of the bot running, it's probably taking longer

04:23:16 <Camail> thats...dumb
04:23:28 <Camail> loading the web page is dumb
04:33:45 <ZK> ok, it was a bad bot
04:33:50 <ZK> other bot works perfectly
04:58:58 <Camail> thats good
05:46:26 <Camail> .tell dot` Yo. Remember that one joke I made that was good, yea. Man that joke, tho.

20:51:57 <DoT_> nice
20:51:59 <ZK> very generic so far, hopefully they will become interesting!
20:53:24 <DoT_> what system you decide on?
20:58:51 <ZK> numenera
20:59:14 <ZK> its an interesting system, feels more tactical based when you make rolls
21:00:22 <ZK> i remember it being someone on here that actually recommended that system at first
21:00:26 <ZK> dunno who tho
21:30:24 <DoT_> hmm, dont recall

22:24:59 <Camail> Interesting topic. Kinda meh content in the paper, but this topic deserves a real anthropological attempt.
22:43:57 <ZK> heh

22:49:20 <Camail> well that was weird
22:49:42 <Camail> hexchat thought me typing meant it should force quit
23:00:56 <skram> Hai.
23:01:10 <skram> Did you write something rude?
23:04:27 <DoT_> oh skrams not dead
23:04:53 <skram> wow contain your enthusiasm dot
23:11:27 <DoT_> ok
23:13:58 <Camail> reification this paper actually gets something wrong, it says porn was an influence on JP fetishes, but the data from pornhub in japan consistently, every year, says that japanese people only look at japanese porn
23:14:47 <Camail> I'd like to see an anthropologist interview the creators/editors/business men to get the actual story
23:14:58 <reification> yes cam, the censorship laws are de facto protectionism for the market as far as i can tell
23:17:26 <Camail> It's becoming lcearer to me that there aren't any substantial sources for the prescriptive points brought up in this article.
23:17:53 <reification> you should write a comment on it
23:17:55 <Camail> The topic is supported by descriptive examples, but there really isn't much else.
23:17:57 <Camail> lolno
23:18:18 <Camail> that would mean making an account
23:18:54 <reification> ok well when you get rich you can fund your own study :p
23:19:35 <reification> can you not anon comment with fake/temp email
23:19:38 <DuB`> skram
23:19:44 <skram> dub
23:20:02 <DuB`> So I was tired of having to replace the fragile stock cord on my headphones every two months.
23:20:19 <DuB`> Got a fancy sturdy one made for the m2's (for cheaper, too!)
23:21:01 <DuB`> It came with a larger adapter for the jack, but the threading you screw it onto meant I couldn't fit in the jack when my phone was in its case.
23:21:22 <DuB`> And I just kept thinking about how easily clickspring could turn the threading off in his lathe. :P
23:21:30 <Camail> reification  idc about the anonymity, i don't want to go through the effort just to shit on some random guys effort
23:21:43 <skram> haha
23:22:05 <skram> You could just enlarge the hole in your phone case DuB`!
23:22:21 <DuB`> Also it turns out the threading was sharp(?) enough to just twist right into the soft plastic of the case, so it was fine.
23:22:29 <DuB`> ... that would make too much sense, skram.
23:22:45 <skram> Ah, my apologies :p
23:23:16 <DuB`> And the the cord will NEVER get yanked out of my phone because it's screwed into the case.
23:23:17 <DuB`> Heheh
23:23:30 <skram> So you made threads in your case with the plug
23:23:37 <Camail> so now it will just catapult your  phone out of your pocket 
23:23:37 <skram> Very good mr dub
23:23:58 <Camail> I'd rather have a wire rip out than take hardware with it
23:24:18 <DuB`> It's one of those wallet cases with a clasp and everything cam, the phone is pretty safe.
23:25:39 <Camail> meh, to each their own
23:29:58 <Camail> DuB` did you finish witcher 3
23:30:05 <DuB`> Notyet
23:30:13 <Camail> skram you should do it before him
23:30:18 <Camail> and then consume him for his power
23:30:41 <skram> dub is not a dragon
23:30:46 <skram> nor am i the dragonborn
23:30:48 <Camail> i got so burnt out on witcher 3 i never finished the first dlc, and never bought the second
23:30:54 <Camail> skram those are both lies
23:31:00 <Camail> they are actual real life life
23:31:12 <skram> im almost old enough to do the first
23:31:22 <skram> see if i can do both before i finish the main quest
23:31:40 <Camail> pretty sure the level req is higher than the end game stuff
23:32:13 <skram> last one is 36
23:32:18 <skram> i think
23:32:37 <Camail> mym memory is fairly skewed because i only did them in ng+
23:32:52 <Camail> isnt 36 approaching end game
23:33:29 <skram> I dont know
23:33:46 <skram> Probably is though
23:34:19 <Camail> main quest ends at level 30 recommended
23:34:39 <Camail> so yea dlc is post-game balanced
23:36:07 <Camail> I think i was overleveled cuz i did  a lot of side quests
23:37:13 <Camail> I used the cat witcher armor the entire game
23:40:59 <Camail> dub are you playing on death march difficulty
23:41:04 <Camail> either of you can answer or both
23:41:10 <DuB`> Heavens no.
23:41:11 <Camail> cuz iw anna know if its more fun on lower difficulties
23:41:40 <Camail> death march gets pretty boring cuz you have to play so safely
23:41:52 <skram> im playing on the second easiest
23:42:07 <Camail> I might replay on normal, or something
23:42:21 <Camail> because, just fo fun on ng+, i augmented my quen as much as possible in the game
23:42:26 <Camail> and it still got one shot by everyone
23:43:32 <Camail> kinda want to try a bear/tank build
