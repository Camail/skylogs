15:07:58 <Runbunny> Hai Phearlock.
15:08:21 <Phearlock> Runbun did you see the dumb norwegians who thought a bunch of bus seats were muslims?
15:08:31 <Phearlock> It was pretty great

15:12:10 <Runbunny> Hahaha.
15:12:34 <Runbunny> Surely the empty bus seats are loaded with bombs and weapons :P
15:12:48 <Phearlock> Very scary seats
15:13:50 <Runbunny> They probably aren't even integrated properly and have made no effort whatsoever to learn the norwegian language.

19:07:28 <reification> is more sci-fi and econ than fantasy and econ
19:07:44 <reification> haven‚Äôt finished last part tho so it could all go wrong
19:07:48 <Micen|droid> Ohh
19:08:55 <Micen|droid> Havent done a VN since I pirated an english translation of Clannand before the official one
19:10:30 <reification> i used to be big key fanatic but no more i‚Äôm afraid :/
19:11:52 <Runbunny> Dub is the worst.
19:11:58 <DuB`> ???
19:12:18 <Runbunny> No spice and wolf, no monogatari, no golden boy.
19:12:27 <DuB`> :P
19:12:44 <Runbunny> No xxxholic.
19:12:50 <DuB`> Sounds lewd.
19:13:46 <Runbunny> It's not, not even close.
19:14:04 <reification> have you read xxxholic novel by nisioisin runbun?
19:14:05 <DuB`> Well the title sounds naughty.
19:14:14 <reification> if not you should
19:14:32 <Runbunny> DuB`, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7tO4TDlwRE
19:14:42 <reification> given you like monogatari
19:14:49 <Runbunny> I haven't.
19:15:16 <Runbunny> It was the tsubasa resevoir chronicle one right?
19:15:31 <reification> ???
19:16:05 <Runbunny> nevermind
19:16:14 <Runbunny> I confused myself.
19:16:16 <reification> that‚Äôs a whole different clamp series bun
19:16:49 <Runbunny> Why are you turned this on me Reif? We're not done being disgruntled with Dub!
19:16:57 <Runbunny> turning*
19:17:14 <reification> i expect more from you than dub :p
19:17:19 <Runbunny> :O
19:17:27 <Runbunny> Are you just going to take that Dub?
19:17:50 <reification> also dub read unsong so he gets a lot of credit for that
19:19:04 <reification> i bet you still have nekos to para and all!
19:20:00 <Runbunny> Dang.
19:21:11 <reification> yeah no time for thesis when there‚Äôs important stuff to do
19:21:24 <DuB`> Para neko wat
19:21:33 <Runbunny> Oh Dub.
19:21:40 <Runbunny> You're so young and innocent.
19:21:45 <Runbunny> Then you went to Japan.
19:21:50 <Runbunny> So please get to work.

19:24:29 <reification> she‚Äôs the oldest‚Ä¶
19:25:01 <reification> don‚Äôt be racist against small chests runbun D:
19:25:26 <Micen> phone wasnt getting irc messages.  
19:25:26 <DuB`> >_>
19:25:40 <Micen> Clamp is great. Chobits was a good read and watch
19:27:11 <reification> ccs is best classic magical girl anime and angelic layer is underrated
19:27:58 <Runbunny> oh but Reif. Loli status has nothing to do with age.
19:28:44 <Camail> oh god
19:28:55 <Runbunny> They clearly only made her the oldest since she barely looks old enough.
19:28:56 <reification> banned in australia
19:29:06 <Runbunny> Hai Camail.
19:29:27 <Micen|droid> Angelic layer was good too
19:30:04 <Camail> and the 200 year vampire lolis are totally meant to be adults, pure intentions
19:31:15 <Runbunny> Reif Azuki reminds me of this loli from Saki http://pm1.narvii.com/6130/81a65c7decec214f5b60a1da1fa2276f39a9c78a_hq.jpg
19:31:23 <Runbunny> Just with less taco.
19:31:42 <reification> well you just lost bio‚Äôs interest
19:33:09 <reification> also mahjong is for pointy noses and high stakes not yuri D:
19:34:29 <Runbunny> Clearly Mahjong is all about yuri and not wearing pants.
19:34:53 <DuB`> ???
19:48:49 <Runbunny> Dub you should watch saki.
19:48:58 <Runbunny> So that you can learn how to Mahjong.
19:49:05 <DuB`> I should watch lots of things.
