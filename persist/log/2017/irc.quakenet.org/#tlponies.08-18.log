00:38:58 <DuB`> Icelandguy <3
00:39:27 <skram> this is excellent brooding music
00:40:36 <DuB`> I wish more streamers would go music-less.
00:40:51 <DuB`> I want to watch but NOT listen to NCS/monstercat...
00:41:06 <DuB`> For the billionth time.

22:33:48 <Cane> I'll start earlier than this at least!
22:34:06 <Dot`> not before 6om my time pls
22:34:11 <Dot`> I am work peasant
22:34:17 <Dot`> 6pm
22:36:06 <Cane> Nah, will be closer to 7-8pm probably.
22:36:46 <Dot`> cane, just become a big time streamer and be rich pls
22:37:09 <Cane> Btw, does anyone here use my VLC+Streamlink setup to watch streams? Long shot.
22:37:40 <Runbunny> Dot`, http://i.imgur.com/s2MrRie.mp4
22:37:56 <Dot`> this is the best
22:38:12 <Cane> Ok well that's adorable.
22:38:25 <Runbunny> I did use some livestreamer thingy with MPC at some point Cane. I think the idea is the same but not your setup. I don't even use VLC.
22:38:34 <Cane> Yeah, same idea.
22:38:51 <Cane> Streamlink is the new Livestreamer, it's actually updated and shit.
22:40:08 <Runbunny> Neat.
22:40:12 <Dot`> so noob question, why use it over just opening a stream in a browser
22:41:07 <Runbunny> well it runs better in a media player. It did for me at least since browsers where having problems with streams and stuff at the time.
22:42:38 <Cane> Far less lag, mostly. Afreeca lags frequently for foreign viewers, the site itself is kind of butts.
22:43:13 <Dot`> ah ok
22:43:23 <Cane> With my VLC+Streamlink setup you can set the CDN which helps, and the quality options which helps even more, on top of the fact that a direct link to the stream (instead of using the Afreeca frontend) makes it less laggy to begin with...
22:43:23 <Dot`> afreeca is a nightmare to watch
22:43:39 <Cane> Yeah, it's bad. And all the pros have the dumbest names.
22:43:43 <Cane> Like Bisu is "rlaxordyd" or whatever.
22:43:46 <Cane> Shuttle is jdkskfsrkl or something.
22:43:53 <Cane> Have fun looking that up.
22:43:59 <Dot`> haha
22:44:11 <Cane> They don't care about their IDs, everyone searches for their real names on Afreeca.
22:44:33 <Cane> So my script makes it easier to connect to any known pros, with zero lag, in VLC, able to open multiple instances.
22:44:48 <Dot`> fancy
