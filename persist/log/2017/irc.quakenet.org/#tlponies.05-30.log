13:31:28 <Bio> I'll volunteer to test that lotto happiness theory
13:32:45 <reification> i suspect that with discipline you can use a lotto win for happiness
13:33:11 <reification> but ppl who play the lotto much may well lack that
13:34:14 <Bio> I'd pay off all debt, buy a car and a house somewhere okay, then put like 90% in investments
13:34:36 <Bio> then do whatever I fuckin felt like doing =D
13:35:32 <reification> ah, the thing is while extra money may not be great at bringing happiness, money shortage/debt can be good at bringing misery
13:37:26 <Bio> and preventing misery is just as good I think

19:26:58 <Cane> Unicron mount OP. It eats planets and sounds like Orson Welles.
19:33:49 <DuB`> Cane - I laughed at the part of the video where you mention hoping for a large, open golem boss room. My brother and I got a glitch where the shrine thing is at the bottom of a tiny little zigzagging hallway.
19:34:05 <Cane> LOL
19:34:19 <DuB`> We later found the actual "boss room" - it had no entrances and was below the rest of the dungeon.
19:34:19 <Cane> I've seen some bad temples, but that one is ridiculous.
19:34:42 <Cane> I don't know why the temple is so prone to bugging out.
19:34:58 <DuB`> It actually wasn't bad, he couldn't move at all and we just threw damage around the corner at him. :P
