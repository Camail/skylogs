10:36:01 <Cane> If you can only get your hands on a Tactical Helmet.
10:36:10 <Cane> If I ever get that + full upgrades, I'll know I have a run going.
10:36:24 <Cane> Gonna play some this evening btw. =D
10:36:41 <Dot`> i had a sttel helmet,  i really dont think it does much :P
10:37:01 <Dot`> steel
10:37:10 <Cane> It helps against pistols, some times. =P
10:37:15 <Cane> But it's definitely not good.
10:37:29 <Cane> A good helmet is my #1 priority when I do Iron Man stuff.

15:42:46 <motbob> it doesn't seem to be generating much hype

15:45:44 <Dot`> micen please
15:46:06 <carcinisation> peak conc player is about half yooka laylee
15:48:01 <Dot`> faluire of marketing i guess, i recall there being excitement when it was announced but have seen nothing till it now is released
15:48:55 <motbob> marketing doesn't really matter if your game is good
15:49:05 <motbob> case in point: golf story
15:49:24 <carcinisation> reviews seem decent
15:49:28 <motbob> literally zero marketing, but the switch community seems excited about it
15:53:24 <carcinisation> well some games are unusual enough to be self hype generating

16:47:00 <Dot`> i stop and turn to check there s no dogs or anything in the distance
16:47:23 <Dot`> an army soldier, gun at my head 
16:47:27 <Dot`> dead
16:47:50 <Cane> LOL
16:48:02 <Cane> I freaking love it when the AI does that.
16:48:19 <Cane> It's rare, but the fact that they can actually sneak up on the player and surprise shotgun in the back or whatever
16:48:25 <Cane> Makes STALKER AI the best ever.
16:48:43 <Cane> Every time I walk the swamp I'm worried there's gonna be a solitary bandit crouch walking through the reeds at me.
16:48:50 <Cane> That has genuinely happened and it's so great.
16:50:11 <Dot`> it was an open feild i was runnign full sprint across
16:50:18 <Dot`> i have no idea how he got there
16:51:59 <Dot`> i also at one point got 2 loners to come with me, 1 died almst immediatly to dogs, the other i mistook for a bandit
16:52:06 <Dot`> they laste about 4 minutes

22:58:21 <DuB`> daaayyyys
22:58:27 <CockRoach|42> i hate editing
22:59:26 <DuB`> CritRole, not you! Silly.
22:59:53 <Cane> All right folks. I have returned from my Spotify heavy metal plunge, and I am here to report my findings.
23:00:25 <Cane> Specifically, GLORYHAMMER's "The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee".
23:00:34 <DuB`> Present your findings for peer review.
23:00:36 <DuB`> Aha
23:00:38 <Cane> I was so taken by this beast that I was forced to transcribe the first verse and chorus.
23:00:55 <Cane> Here, then, is what metal is all about. The epitome of metal, if you will.
23:01:01 <Cane> The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee
23:01:06 <Cane> They came with the first light of dawn
23:01:11 <Cane> Setting their sights on Dundee
23:01:15 <Cane> Led by the sorcerer Zargothrax
23:01:19 <Cane> Slaying all people he sees
23:01:23 <Cane> They ride to war on once noble beasts
23:01:27 <Cane> Corrupted by wizard's spell
23:01:29 <Cane> The Unicorns used to be good
23:01:33 <Cane> Now they are forced to serve hell
23:01:40 <Cane> Down from the mountains
23:01:42 <Cane> and across the river Tay
23:01:46 <Cane> An army of undead unicorns
23:01:48 <Cane> are riding into the fray
23:01:53 <Phearlock> listening to it now
23:01:53 <Cane> Fireballs and lightning
23:01:55 <Cane> are raining from the sky
23:01:58 <Cane> Chaos and bloodshed
23:01:58 <CockRoach|42> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlhQZFTvAn4
23:02:00 <Cane> While all the people die
23:02:03 <Cane> In this epic battle
23:02:05 <Cane> begins the final war
23:02:07 <Cane> Tragedy will strike this day
23:02:09 <Phearlock> I am highly amused
23:02:10 <Cane> Prepare thee for
23:02:12 <Cane> THE UNICORN INVASION OF DUNDEE
23:02:32 <DuB`> My favorite part is "all the people die".
23:02:33 <DuB`> Catchy.
23:02:41 <Cane> My favorite part is the following masterpiece:
23:02:56 <Cane> "Fireballs make everybody die"
23:03:01 <Cane> Poetry.
23:03:03 <Cane> Pure poetry.
23:03:05 <CockRoach|42> :D
23:03:12 <Phearlock> So true
23:03:40 <Cane> Everyone should click on CR's link. The lyrics video is a thing of beauty.
23:03:50 <Cane> Watch the lyrics go by and laugh your asses off.
23:04:13 <Phearlock> thank you for bringing us this piece of fine art cane
23:04:25 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlhQZFTvAn4
23:04:29 <Cane> You are very welcome Phearlock.
23:04:35 <Cane> I knew once I found this gem it needed to be shared.
23:05:01 <CockRoach|42> <3
23:07:32 <Cane> I can't tell if they're deliberately awful, or if they're actually trying to write good lyrics. I honestly have no idea if they're genuine, and that makes it hilarious to me.
23:09:12 <Cane> They're not even Scandinavian. They're Scottish-Swiss. There's no excuse for the structure of those lyrics.
23:09:25 <DuB`> Haha

23:09:58 <Cane> Well, I had fun.

23:11:11 <CockRoach|42> (for some values of awesome)
23:11:56 <BioPhone> Asdfghjkl
23:13:33 <Cane> Agreed Bio.
