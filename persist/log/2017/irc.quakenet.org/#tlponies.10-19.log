22:15:29 <DuB`study> dot
22:16:29 <DuB`study> No new xkcd what-if ever ever never
22:23:29 <Dot`> indeed
22:24:42 <skrm> dub what are you study
22:24:53 <DuB`study> Doin' group tax research
22:25:19 <skrm> did you figure out how i can cheat on my taxes yet
22:26:14 <skrm> I checked my things yesterday and i think 35% is too much
22:27:03 <DuB`study> Move to an uninhabited tax shelter island for >50% of the year, probably.
22:27:17 <skrm> interesting
22:27:24 <skrm> where do i find one of those
22:27:44 <Crisium> create an LLC in Grand Cayman
22:27:50 <DuB`study> Unfortunately, unless you can work from said island, your financial well-being is likely better served by staying where you are. :P
22:28:12 <DuB`study> Oh I dunno, just swim around the Pacific for a while.
22:28:16 <DuB`study> I hear there are plenty.
22:29:12 <Crisium> just launder your money through me skrm
22:29:30 <Crisium> dont worry, you'll get most of it back
22:30:15 <skrm> ok kool
22:30:33 <skrm> gimme your things and ill wire you FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
22:30:40 <DuB`study> Launder your illicit chocolate income through me.
22:30:45 <DuB`study> I'm good at handling that.
22:31:04 <skrm> if you nibble more than 35% its kinda wasted though
22:31:53 <DuB`study> I am contractualy obligated to nibble no more the greater of 11% or 30% of what I save you.
22:32:00 <DuB`study> more than the*
22:32:21 <DuB`study> Contingent fees are illegal for tax advice, but not chocolate advice!
22:33:30 <skrm> excellent
22:34:07 <DuB`study> So I have to do a silly "creative project" for my super-easy literature class
22:34:26 <DuB`study> Basically ANYTHING in the world that is at least tangentially related to anything we've read.
