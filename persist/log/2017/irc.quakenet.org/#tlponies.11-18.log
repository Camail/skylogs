04:26:02 <Micen|Droid> Hey has anyone who has never played endless space / es2 want to do a multiplayer stream of it. Just going in completely blind and being dumb at a game
04:26:07 <Micen|Droid> ? 
04:30:38 <Camail> i wanted to learn more so http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/resources/rules/MagicCompRules_21031101.pdf
04:30:48 <Camail> rule 704 details all state based actions
04:31:04 <Camail> this card is a little bit broken on a fundamental level

04:32:04 <micen> I thought about going out for judge program
04:32:15 <micen> Did you hear that magic is dying Cam?
04:32:32 <Camail> i wouldn't know, seems lively to me
04:33:07 <micen> according to numbers released by Mark Rosewater, it dropped from 40millon in 2014 to 12 million players globally
04:33:45 <Camail> guess what released in 2014
04:34:05 <micen> yeah

04:34:40 <Camail> hearthstone, aka magic lite
04:36:27 <micen> true
04:40:15 <Camail> i cant find where he posted those numbers
04:40:28 <Camail> the numbers that i can find say 21 million in 2014
04:40:57 <micen> whoops rememved a 4 there 
04:41:15 <micen> I thought something didnt add up there
04:42:57 <Camail> also on record, there are 1 million active users in the DCI database
04:43:08 <Camail> just reading https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/05/what-we-learned-65000/ now
04:44:11 <Camail> having 5% sign up rate seems realistic so i wouldn't be surprised if the numbers were fudged to make it look dead
04:44:24 <Camail> no question it was hurt by hearthstone
04:44:36 <Camail> HS offers mobility, simplicity, production quality, and familiarity with IP
04:44:54 <Crisium> ded gaem
04:45:12 <Camail> and it fills a broader market, so it took a lot of people away, my brother included
04:45:15 <Camail> who looooves magic
04:45:28 <Camail> he played competitive legacy dredge, so he LOVES magic
04:45:42 <Camail> and it was just too convenient and satisfied his card lust
04:45:54 <Camail> but he recently got back into magic and realized how much he missed it
04:46:35 <Camail> like, he willfully forgot how much he loves mtg simply because HS was so much easier to access and play in his current lifestyle
04:46:42 <Camail> and that happened to millions of people
04:52:46 <Camail> oh god, the SBA card ruins so many infinite combos
04:52:46 <micen> I really dont like some design choices in hearthstone
04:53:05 <Camail> +1/+1 and -1/-1 markers dont cancel out
04:53:19 <Camail> though i suppose that doesnt matter than the create cant die from have n<0 life
04:53:19 <micen> http://www.magicspoiler.com/mtg-spoiler/side-quest/ is a great card if you have more than lethal on board and a friend also playing elsewhere
04:54:09 <Camail> but also its good for getting a nice +2/+2 off curve 
04:54:35 <Camail> unless they fuckin kill it
04:57:10 <micen> all these cards are great. 
04:57:15 <micen> Entirely Normal Armchair 
04:57:36 <Camail> http://www.magicspoiler.com/mtg-spoiler/modular-monstrosity/
04:57:46 <Camail> that might be my favorite

04:59:16 <Camail> landfall?? what does this landfall do i dont know!
04:59:30 <Micen|Droid> Give it denimwalk
04:59:35 <Camail> extort!
04:59:42 <Micen|Droid> Prowess
04:59:46 <Camail> i dont think the walks are keywords
04:59:52 <Camail> like swampwalk and islandwalk?
04:59:54 <Camail> maybe they are
05:00:05 <micen> landwalk
05:00:07 <Camail> ok it is
05:00:42 <micen> give it Horsemanship
05:00:44 <Camail> good old rule 702.14
05:01:00 <Camail> if you ran that card you would just make a keyword list on a piece of paper
05:01:06 <Camail> and hope to god you remember the trigger
05:01:06 <micen> Yes
05:01:58 <micen> wait. it keeps keywords until midnight each day
05:02:38 <micen> http://www.magicspoiler.com/mtg-spoiler/over-my-dead-bodies/ could be so broken
05:05:14 <Camail> yea i was just looking at that
05:06:27 <micen> damn i wish i had money for FtV transform
05:06:40 <micen> I need a second jace 
05:09:19 <Camail> i only play casually so i really only play pauper because its so easy to put together
05:10:00 <micen> I want to start putting together a modern fog deck
05:11:01 <Camail> oh, so you also dont want your opponent to have fun
05:11:10 <Camail> that is a popular archetype
05:11:12 <micen> fun is only for me
05:11:29 <micen> there are no control players in my local modern scene. 
05:11:45 <micen> its all midrange and goblins. 
05:12:01 <micen> so no one has counters for it. 
05:12:19 <micen> I also want to put together a toxic blue EDH deck 
05:12:52 <Camail> thats a weird meta when no one is playing slow decks
05:14:16 <micen> I know. I had one of the store owners threaten to throw me out during Origins standard for playing fog because my games ususally went nearly to time 
05:14:50 <micen> That and no one ran Artifact hate at the time so I just got up Orbs of Warding and then burn couldn't do anything to me. 
05:15:06 <micen> couldnt do anything until I milled them out. 
05:15:20 <micen> Then the Eldrazi came out and killed my deck.

16:43:16 <DuB`> G'morn
16:45:34 <Dot`> Dub dub
16:45:36 <Dot`> <3
16:47:23 <DuB`> Dot dot <3
16:47:57 <DuB`> I had
16:48:20 <DuB`> A dream about my uni putting on a required-entry surprise PUBG tourney
16:48:27 <DuB`> And I smashed everyone
16:49:06 <DuB`> Then a dream about my family living in a little outpost on a dark hoth-style planet and getting banished to the outside with only some sort of power suit on
16:49:08 <DuB`> Huh
16:50:30 <Dot`> those are odd
16:51:34 <Dot`> when this current test svr with vaulting gets pushed to main servers i tihnk i will try pubg again
16:51:57 <DuB`> Let's!
16:52:10 <Rawr|Fone> The dubpony!
16:52:24 <DuB`> The rarpon!
16:53:59 <Rawr|Fone> What a pony 😍
16:57:13 <DuB`> Dot` I saw in passing that the update has lots of optimization too, dunno if true.
16:57:21 <Dot`> yea
16:57:31 <Dot`> rework of ballistics ttoo
16:57:38 <DuB`> !
16:57:47 <DuB`> Damage or bullet paths?
16:57:51 <DuB`> Or like netstuff?
16:58:38 <Dot`> all
16:58:45 <DuB`> Wha
16:59:04 <Dot`> but main thing in ballistics is bullet velocity will decrease over distance
16:59:15 <Dot`> so that changes everthing with shooting
17:00:02 <Dot`> .tell Bio https://derpicdn.net/img/2017/11/17/1588699/large.jpeg
17:00:19 <DuB`> Wowee
