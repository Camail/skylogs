07:24:23 <Camail> i found a build with aisleng i like
07:25:49 <DuB`> And I like tripp.
07:25:51 <DuB`> That is all.
07:26:00 <Camail> DuB`  its probably way easier to solo carry as a tank
07:26:20 <Camail> but i dunno if i want to play a tank
07:26:29 <Camail> aisleng is kinda tanky if you build her that way
07:26:37 <Camail> by lvl 10 i was actually really tanky
07:27:13 <Camail> what about the other flankers
