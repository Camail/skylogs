01:25:20 <Micen> nn Phear
01:25:48 <Micen> my IRC isnt updating as quick as it used to.
01:26:00 <Micen> its weird seeing lag on IRC
01:28:47 <Camail> I think my favorite part of DMing was making the wizards dub would meet
01:28:53 <Camail> I made like 10
01:29:02 <Camail> I should do that again, but with higher level wizards
01:29:06 <DuB`> :O
01:29:18 <DuB`> rip
01:29:29 <Camail> I literally put the spells into a randomizer and made backstories for thme based on the spells they knew
01:29:54 <Micen> was there a group of them on a landmass next to a sea ocean or lake?
01:30:15 <Camail> it was landlocked, sadly
01:30:20 <ZK> dub wizard meet dub wizard
01:30:23 <Micen> aww
01:30:28 <Micen> no wizards of the coast
01:31:03 <Camail> I think using a module was really bad for my style of story telling
01:31:06 <Camail> or at least that module
01:31:33 <Micen> What one was that?
01:31:40 <Camail> ummmm
01:31:43 <Camail> the new elemental evils
01:31:56 <Camail> princes of the apocolypse
01:32:25 <Micen> ahh yeah
01:32:37 <ZK> best part of modules is having the maps i find
01:32:46 <DuB`> Well no apocalypse happened so I guess we won!
01:32:46 <ZK> then i found lots of maps online, so not too bad
01:32:47 <DuB`> Woohoo
01:33:04 <Camail> It made it hard to rpep when i didnt care about the story
01:33:26 <Camail> I want to make a small lvl 1-3 setting
01:33:34 <Micen> I need to find some kind of local group to play with that isnt my friends.
01:33:47 <ZK> local game store might have that?
01:33:58 <Camail> yea i feel ya, my friends are all the worst
01:34:02 <Micen> Most likely but that means going out and meeting new people :P
01:34:07 <Camail> as charismatic as a soggy brick
01:34:19 <Micen> I like my friends, they are just bad at D&D
01:34:40 <Micen> One of them was new( and might be good?) the other was literally playing another game at the table. 
01:34:57 <Micen> another, not D&D game. 
01:35:31 <Micen> thought it would be better to decktest than play after pressuring me to DM before I was ready. 
01:36:06 <Micen> by before I was ready I mean I was only given twenty minutes to read the Phandelver book. 
01:37:15 <Camail> I guess I can see being pressured into that if you've never done it. Given what i know now I would laugh and outright say no
01:38:10 <Micen> Yeah, I mean I had dmed once like over a decade ago, it it was very seat of my pants, pulling up some monster sheets and giving loot for a one-shot. 
01:39:33 <Camail> The creative part of my brain can't function when I'm using a module, I felt uncomfortable the entire time
01:39:48 <Micen> Also guy didnt even want to do the module. "Ill ride back to Waterdeep and get a few of the guard to come down and help the town with bandits."
01:40:26 <Micen> Yeah, I can see that. and i know i complained about this guy before. 
01:41:01 <Camail> enjoy spending weeks on the road
01:41:13 <Camail> oh no, the town got ransacked 
01:41:16 <Camail> while you were away
01:41:18 <Camail> for almost a month
01:41:38 <Camail> there are always ways to outsmart your players
01:41:53 <Camail> I'm a very relaxed DM, my goal is for the players to enjoy the game
01:42:04 <Micen> Also gave a brief character summary sheet for them to fill out so I could get to know their characters and tie in more after the (small) module. Does your character have a family. "Yes" Did your character serve in the military "Yes." Does your character believe in any Deities? "No."
01:42:06 <Camail> but its almost too easy to ruin their plans
01:42:19 <Camail> did you talk to him
01:44:18 <Micen> I did. I also asked if he wanted to play considering he bought the module and bought me the official dm screen. He said he did. I also explained that I liked a more story driven thing over just straight combat encounter after combat encounter. that I would do more traps and social encounters and he said he was down for that but lacked interest when there was anything other than combat.
01:45:39 <Camail> eh, it happens, its the dichotomy unfortunately
01:45:45 <Micen> Also, after saying no to any beliefs. "Maybe ill take a level or two in cleric so I can heal for us."  
01:46:46 <Camail> many people who play videogames have that mentality
01:46:54 <Camail> we're trained to interact like that
01:47:01 <Micen> Also got mad because encounters were "too easy" when I did the math to half the rating since there were only two of them playing. demanded that I throw the full encounters at them
01:47:56 <Camail> you're using words like demanded and pressured, its painting him to be an asshole
01:48:02 <Camail> so is your friend just an asshole?
01:48:50 <Micen> then next encounter, which i played at full power from the book, got bent that the bandits that they could have walked away from attacked and killed them. and asked if they could restart before the the fight and if i could lower it to where it was before. 
01:49:28 <ZK> oh god the video game mentality
01:49:35 <Micen> A little, but he is also actually slightly autistic so its hard to tell whats asshole and what are the personal social problems
01:49:43 <Micen> literally wanted to save scum
01:50:17 <ZK> eh, autists can be assholes for the hell of it.
01:50:37 <Micen> Also, went through the trouble to buy a DM screen just to look over it and call out my dice rolls before I can. 
01:51:02 <Micen> So I cant lie about what i am rolling and modify some rolls so they didnt just die. 
01:52:03 <Micen> Now im itching to DM a real group
01:52:13 <Micen> I blame cam for getting me talking about it.
01:52:25 <Camail> rekt
01:52:52 <Camail> if you dont want to go offline, you could go to the roll20 community
01:52:53 <ZK> do it online micen
01:53:07 <ZK> really easy to just host a game, and people join you
01:53:24 <Micen> Also dodged a bullet of a 3.5 group my sisters not-quite-boyfriend joined. 
01:53:41 <Camail> ?spells
01:53:51 <Camail> fucking RIP good formatting
01:53:54 <Camail> .r spells https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/spells/
01:53:54 <Micen> But you dont get the fun of sitting around a table asking for Doritos and casting magic missiles into the darkness.
01:54:28 <Camail> Micen  yes you trade the nuanced social interaction for the ease of online interaction
01:54:37 <Camail> and online interaction is easier because it doesnt have the nuanced social interaction
01:54:42 <Camail> kinda inherent with your problem
01:55:02 <Micen> They rotate DMs on a game by game basis. level 5, and the groups barbarian cant be hit on anything less than a 19 roll and swings for fireball damage. 
01:55:25 <Camail> firebolt
01:55:29 <Camail> fireball is 8d6
01:55:38 <Micen> True...
01:55:47 <Micen> no. fireball.
01:55:55 <Camail> thats impossible unless they just cheat
01:56:07 <Micen> he swings for 8d6 damage. 
01:56:09 <ZK> also, online is fun to add music
01:56:12 <Micen> they just cheat
01:56:14 <ZK> sound really adds a lot
01:56:15 <Camail> I should get my brother in a game
01:56:55 <Micen> also CR is on.
01:57:02 <Camail> not yet!
01:57:03 <Camail> 4 minutes
01:57:06 <Camail> aka 24 minutes
01:57:17 <Micen> well
01:57:18 <Micen> about to be
01:57:37 <Micen> wont take that long
01:57:49 <Micen> i hope
02:08:29 <Micen> Sams shirt is great
02:20:12 <Micen> Cam, did I ever thank you for pointing this show out to me? If not, thank you.
02:20:25 <Camail> is good show
02:21:02 <Micen> It is. 
02:24:50 <Camail> DuB`  also i had a cool thing for you when you died
02:24:59 <DuB`> :o
02:25:05 <Camail> Those dreams were from you being in the primordial planes
02:25:11 <DuB`> Oh yah those
02:25:34 <Camail> because that area was rife with elemental plane shit, obviously
02:25:46 <Camail> so anyone dying was getting stuck there
02:26:03 <Camail> that wasnt in canon that was just myt hing
02:26:08 <Camail> to make death more interesting
02:34:32 <DuB`> Oooh
02:36:11 <Camail> also you guys totally released a failed lich's spirit
02:36:24 <Camail> it was amusing how, because nothing immediately happened, you all thought everything was ok
02:36:34 <DuB`> Is fiiiine
02:36:36 <Camail> it makes scheming VERY easy against unexperienced players
02:36:58 <Camail> ALSO that temple was connected to a dwarven ruin
02:37:10 <Camail> if anyone fell to their death it would've been into a level 10 area
02:37:31 <DuB`> So many things.
02:37:57 <Camail> thats 3 things!
02:38:18 <Camail> there's a lot of other stuff i did that never actually happened
02:38:26 <Camail> way too much work for a world i didnt care about
02:38:36 <Camail> but I'm working on something small
02:39:33 <DuB`> I guess we all became ba2:Sat Nov  1 15:20:57 2014

[29-Dec-2012:24:31 <DoT|Phone1> bio pon
12:24:44 <skram> It went ok I think
12:24:59 <DoT|Phone1> good
12:25:06 <skram> Test started 8, and by 8:30 I had checked out my hotel room and was on my way home
12:25:22 <DoT|Phone1> that's a short test
12:25:57 <skram> 30 questions with 3 possible answers
12:26:08 <motbob> 3 possible answers lmao
12:26:19 <motbob> talk about variance playing a role
12:26:24 <motbob> you could pass by chance almost
12:26:26 <skram> 3 options i mean
12:26:32 <skram> of which 1 is correct
12:26:33 <skram> :p
12:26:36 <motbob> right
12:26:49 <Bio> pick all bs
12:26:51 <Bio> win test
12:26:56 <Bio> ez
12:27:09 <reification> somewhere i have stats on mult-choice setters biases
12:27:16 <reification> in case you need to guess
12:27:28 <skram> Its a bit late now im afraid
12:28:43 <motbob> well they might be useful tomorrow
12:28:49 <skram> Honestly the only thing that was a bit shit was the fact that some of the questions were very unclear and could have 2 answers depending on what they mean
12:29:02 <DoT|Phone1> that's always the way
12:29:02 <motbob> i'm taking an ethics exam that every lawyer has to pass
12:29:04 <skram> but it said that only 1 answer was correct at the top of it so dunno
12:29:17 <DoT|Phone1> interpretation
12:29:19 <motbob> the test I'm taking is the one that hot_bid legendarily failed
12:29:33 <motbob> though he passed the bar (the hard test)
12:29:37 <Bio> hotbit no ethics confirmed
12:29:55 <reification> no shown bias in 3 answer but for 4 more Bs and 5 more Es
12:30:29 <Bio> for 5's i think there are more E: all of the above
12:30:32 <skram> what if they use numbers reif
12:30:40 <motbob> i bet the MPRE's randomized
12:30:51 <reification> just giving position skram
12:31:02 <reification> maybe bio
12:31:16 <reification> all/none of above is right 65% of time
12:32:07 <reification> otherwise you usually want to avoid anwers with never, always, all or none in
12:32:50 <motbob> unfortunately the test-makers I have battled have gotten cleverer as I have gotten older
12:33:18 <motbob> with "none of the above" generally being "please pick this if you can't find the true right answer that's hidden in A-D"
12:33:32 <reification> anwser distribution is usually ‘anti-random’ so if you know neighbouring ones guess diff
12:34:46 <reification> generally they get better motbob
12:35:21 <reification> although i did pass a uni module i had abandoned and was forced to test for anyway purely on logic vs poor setting
12:37:21 <motbob> with the MPRE, it's a fairly easy test to BS, since you are answering questions on what legal rules are
12:37:22 <DoT|Phone1> lol
12:37:31 <motbob> you just have to think about what the best rule would be
12:39:49 <reification> oh diff states have diff passing scores :O
12:40:04 <reification> i guess we can tell which are more corrupt then :p

16:00:50 <DuB`> YO YO OHAYO
16:02:25 <DuB`> Quiet morning pons. >_>
16:04:12 <skram> HEY DUB
16:04:18 <DuB`> Ssshhh!
16:04:20 <skram> HOWS YOU DO DUB
16:04:22 <DuB`> This is a library.
16:04:28 <DuB`> hi skram
16:04:29 <skram> FUCK UR BOOKS
16:04:30 <DuB`> im gud
16:05:10 <skram> Did you win your exam?
16:05:15 <DuB`> Dunno.
16:05:36 <skram> How many % for pass
16:05:57 <DuB`> Will pass for sure, pls
16:06:12 <skram> Or do you need a certain grade for your scholarship
16:06:23 <DuB`> The question is whether I did well enough on all three to solidify my ranking for future masters program application.
16:06:31 <carcinisation> we believe in the dub that believes in himself
16:06:31 <DuB`> Our master program here is Top 5 USA
16:06:52 <skram> Do you get a special profile icon if you graduate then
16:06:56 <DuB`> Yeh
16:07:01 <skram> rad
16:07:29 <DuB`> If I don't make the masters here I can still get into... just about any MAcc program anywhere (and with scholarship $$$ too) though, so it's fine either way. :P
16:08:58 <skram> win win
16:09:12 <DuB`> Rather stay here though. 
16:09:16 <DuB`> Much more convenient! :D
16:11:03 <Dot`> DAB zounds!
16:11:24 <Zounds> Hey dot

16:12:52 <DuB`> Took brother to his first all-you-can-eat indocurry for his birthday with some friends.

16:15:40 <Zounds> indian is my preference but you can get all kinds
16:15:55 <skram> I would if I could, really
16:16:00 <DuB`> I greatly dislike thai curry.
16:16:04 <DuB`> It's spicy water!
16:16:09 <DuB`> Or at least what I had was.
16:16:24 <Zounds> I don't mind thai but it's noting compared to indian
16:16:45 <Zounds> I had moroccan curry once and it was rather good
16:19:03 <DuB`> Aw man...
