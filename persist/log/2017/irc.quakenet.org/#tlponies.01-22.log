00:00:08 <Camail> the big creature fights are a lot light monster hunter but they are kinda simple
00:00:33 <Camail> but my character is pretty and has daggers than murder everything in the game in less than 30 seconds
00:01:12 <Camail> playthroughs can vary from like 10 hours to...I am currently at 144 hours

00:01:58 <Camail> oh, also all 9 classes are mechanically distinct from each other in VERY meaningful ways

00:02:31 <Camail> and you can change between them at will and figure out what you want
00:03:18 <Camail> I went from fighter > mystic knight > fighter > assassin > (did end game exploits to level everything) > strider
00:03:44 <Camail> parries, counters, dodges, you choose what defensive options you want to use
00:04:29 <Camail> I guess the easiest way to phrase it is dark souls + monster hunter
00:05:08 <Camail> I would never recommend buying it until it goes on sale, which will probably be every single sale
00:05:21 <Camail> its a shit ton of value for 20 USD
00:05:28 <skram> it sounds kinda neat
00:05:36 <skram> i will put it on my wishlist
00:06:07 <Phearlock> I tried it but stopped at 7 hours. Can't remember why though
00:06:21 <Phearlock> might just have been other games hitting at the time that I wanted to play more.
00:07:01 <Camail> also when you hit max level (200) you go from 199 to âˆž
00:07:22 <Camail> thats 100% why i ground from 150 to 200
00:07:45 <Camail> which only took like 6-ish hours
00:07:57 <Camail> DD is totally a game you forget about
00:10:35 <Camail> I would suggest not summoning my pawn because it would ruin every boss fight
00:13:53 <Bio> asdf
00:14:00 <Bio> i did a nap
00:14:04 <Bio> hello

00:36:28 <Camail> Dot and I played EH and we got fukt
00:36:42 <Camail> The chef is really fun, but not for 2 players
00:36:51 <DuB`> Par for the course.
00:36:56 <Camail> I want to play that game at least one time with 4 people
00:38:54 <Bio> i'm around
00:40:02 <Camail> dort isnt tho
00:40:39 <Camail> i just figured out the logo of tlp boardgame stack
00:40:58 <Camail> its just one shitty pony with a piece of plywood precariously balanced on its back
00:41:02 <Bio> is it flipped tables
00:43:19 <Dot`> i am around tomorow to game things
00:43:38 <Dot`> and "we should play avalon, then secret hitler, then spyfall"
00:43:40 <Dot`> ok
00:43:45 <Dot`> i dont know avelon though
00:45:40 <Camail> https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon
00:50:51 <skram> spyfall is grrreat
00:51:07 <Dot`> ok, grabbed highest subscribed one on steam
00:52:04 <Dot`> there is a pony spyfall in the workshop, just saying
00:52:31 <Yolteotl> TERRANNNN
00:52:50 <Dot`> ?
00:52:58 <Dot`> gg Korea as well
00:53:12 <Camail> nevermind both the top rated avalon ports look like SHIT
00:53:40 <Camail> I kinda wanted to do avalon before secret hitler because its simpler, but its so ugly
00:54:08 <Dot`> ok
00:54:17 <Dot`> time to make your own cam
00:54:21 <Camail> lol no
00:54:51 <Camail> There is a list of things i don't want to do that i would need to do
00:55:13 <Camail> primarily scan every piece and implement them

12:53:39 <Yolteotl> This guy was almost as socialist as a french can be.
12:53:58 <Yolteotl> *right wing french guy can be
12:53:59 <Yolteotl> :D
12:54:21 <Micen> i forgot that your sides are just as backwards as the side of the road you drive on. 
12:54:40 <Yolteotl> ahaha, no, it is the same
12:55:06 <Yolteotl> just that your democrat are way more at the right than our republican :P
12:55:20 <Micen> ahh
12:55:33 <Micen> the true French fear of a fight.
12:55:41 <Micen> :P
12:55:54 <Yolteotl> almost socialist state \o/
12:56:08 <Micen> i have to ask, how do you keep your flags so clean.
12:56:16 <Micen> that solid white can be seen for miles around.
12:56:37 <Yolteotl> you know I can go to a hospital without any money :d
12:56:51 <Micen> so can I. 
12:56:58 <Micen> I am on my parents insurance still 
12:57:31 <Yolteotl> because my country is blessed by God :P
12:57:37 <Yolteotl> our white can't change
12:57:41 <Yolteotl> :D:D:D
12:58:03 <Yolteotl> the good God I mean, the one that did not choose Trump 
12:58:04 <Yolteotl> hahaha
12:58:46 <Micen> In all seriousness, all I can do is hope that trump is a painless 4 to 8 years
12:59:17 <Yolteotl> eeyup
12:59:26 <Yolteotl> 2 days, and he did not use nuke yet
12:59:35 <Yolteotl> I think that's a good start.
12:59:49 <Micen> its a weekend. 
12:59:53 <Yolteotl> ahaha
12:59:53 <Micen> one wasnt a full day
12:59:54 <Yolteotl> shit
13:00:06 <Micen> and today is sunday, so today he rests.
13:00:20 <Yolteotl> I want at least my new car
13:00:22 <Micen> now tomorrow will be the real test. 
13:00:24 <Yolteotl> before getting nuked
13:02:28 <Micen> where is your car being made at?
13:02:36 <Yolteotl> France! 
13:02:44 <Yolteotl> in Alsace, my native area :p
13:02:51 <Micen> should have bought one of those fancy foreign American cars
13:03:44 <Yolteotl> I'd like too
13:03:48 <Yolteotl> I want a Dodge Viper
13:03:58 <Yolteotl> but it is soooo expensive for a french guy :(
13:04:11 <Micen> just buy a tesla 
13:04:18 <Yolteotl> I may come working in USA to buy one :P
13:04:25 <Yolteotl> stealing your job
13:04:39 <Micen> sorry yolt 
13:04:45 <Micen> you will get TRUMPed

13:05:12 <Yolteotl> not really, I'm working in a french company, that have an american division :P
13:05:15 <Micen> because thats where they all come from
13:05:29 <Yolteotl> so, it is not really a normal immigration
13:07:18 <Yolteotl> my father bought a camaro some months ago
13:07:43 <Micen> my car is the best
13:08:10 <Micen> 0 upkeep, 0 fuel costs, 0 chance of it getting in an accident. 
13:08:17 <Micen> because it doesn't exist.
