00:02:54 <DuB`> WHAT
00:03:02 <DuB`> Lucio:
00:03:03 <DuB`> Song's area-of-effect radius decreased from 30 meters to 10 meters
00:03:11 <DuB`> Healing-per-second has been increased by 50% (also applies to LÃºcio's Amp It Up ability)
00:03:54 <DuB`> Assassin lucio got hug buff Kappa 
00:03:55 <DuB`> >:D
00:04:10 <ZK> so lucio needs to get real close to heal now?
00:04:11 <ZK> is that it?
00:04:16 <DuB`> More wall ride speed and extra speed burst in between wallrides
00:04:30 <DuB`> And +50% to amp it up
00:04:33 <DuB`> GOTTA GO FASTE
00:05:35 <Dot`> wooosh
00:05:44 <Dot`> zk, Hollow knight
00:12:21 <ZK> looks fun
00:12:29 <ZK> cute artstyle
00:14:09 <DuB`> LOL
00:14:16 <DuB`> Lucio boop is sooooo lethal now.
00:14:34 <DuB`> You can crouch and aim up while you do it and they go way far

01:21:50 <DoT_> cooman, why did your link crash my irc
01:22:10 <Caumen> wot
01:22:20 <Crisium> so they want more deathballs
01:22:24 <Caumen> I'm so sorry dots
01:22:36 <DoT_> <3
01:25:36 <DoT`> DUB
01:26:16 <ZK> dub do you like food
01:26:25 <Caumen> Lucio would probably be more fun with those changes, but his whole deal was about the large aoe buffs he gave
01:26:41 <ZK> yea caumen, dub was sayin he might main lucio now :o
01:27:08 <DuB`> I kinda already do.
01:27:34 <Caumen> He's already a lot of fun
01:28:22 <Caumen> Been playing him a lot lately, although his wall riding ability does get worse with higher pings :(
01:31:03 <Crisium> so lucio songs only covers 11% of the area he did before
01:31:13 <Caumen> Is it that severe
01:31:14 <Crisium> thats a gigantic change
01:31:17 <Caumen> Damn
01:31:39 <Caumen> In my head I thought it would be around 20% of original size, but 11%
01:31:51 <Caumen> That's absolutely nuts
01:31:55 <Crisium> thats why nerfing radius is a tricky thing to do
01:32:06 <Crisium> blizzard sees "1/3 radius" but thats not how math works
01:32:12 <Caumen> It's gonna make boosting people from spawn really annoying
01:32:40 <Caumen> Well they did make pretty huge buffs all around to mitigate it, so I'm sure they know
01:33:10 <Caumen> 50% better healing along with amp it up getting that buff makes his boost healing pretty good I think
01:34:06 <Crisium> "The big problem that I have with the Lucio changes is that you have attempted to make Lucio more fun by forcing him to stick with his teammates. However, Lucio was fun before because you didn't have to entirely stick with your teammates allowing players to develop their own flair/ playstyle with him. Lucio was the go-to support for dive comps but now I only see him being useful in deathball play (which is already dominated by Ana).
01:34:12 <Crisium> interesting comment
01:34:47 <Crisium> ana's grenade is the ultimate deathball
01:34:56 <Crisium> but... lucio and ana are already the go to healers
01:35:01 <Caumen> It's true, it limits his mobility quite a bit, since he's forced into a small area if he wants to support his team mates
01:35:15 <Crisium> so its not like you are encouraging ana mains to pick lucio, teams will have both anyway
01:36:43 <DuB`> Yeah, lucio will be pretty awful for soloQ/pub support now.
01:36:48 <DuB`> Not enough coordination.
01:37:35 <Caumen> https://i.imgur.com/Ju3HMCE.jpg new entrance on eichenwalde
01:37:44 <carcinisation> bliz screwed up the radius thing on window mine before
01:37:46 <carcinisation> "A new route has been added to Eichenwalde that connects the attacking team's spawn area to the capture point"
01:37:51 <DuB`> O snap
01:37:58 <DoT`> ooo
01:38:03 <DuB`> I can hate eichen less now? :D
01:38:13 <DoT`> and rawr
01:38:14 <DoT`> http://imgur.com/gallery/9PuI0
01:38:42 <Crisium> well thats the thing that made me remember how radius and area scale differently, sc2, not widow mine, but WoL psi storm changes
01:39:07 <Crisium> a little radius goes a long way
01:39:26 <Rawr|Phone> That is nice dot

02:45:53 <Crisium> nevar
02:46:10 <Micen> for the low low price of 80 dollars. 
02:46:27 <Micen> and a promise that they will never touch balance to preserve how the game is played.
02:47:24 <Micen> Or we get the first "Real" starcraft game "Call of Duty: Starcraft"
02:47:47 <Micen> Actually I would play the hell out of a Starcraft shooter game.

03:15:29 <Crisium> cant wait
03:16:23 <Micen> What if...
03:17:01 <Micen> those Showmatch games are the first ones played on the remastered engine?
03:17:44 <Micen> Literally the first thing we see of it is Jaedong playing. that would be sweet.  
03:18:43 <Crisium> theyd have to be sure they got it 100% right tho
03:19:12 <Crisium> i think it might be announcement at the end
03:19:23 <Crisium> but if they are playing it that'd be great
03:19:43 <Micen> that would be really fun.
03:24:27 <Crisium> well gn

17:40:39 <Cane> Oh, but if any of you know of a cloud storage site that allows direct links, let me know.

17:42:34 <Cane> Really? When I say direct links I mean I can put them in a post and have people do right click save as.
17:42:40 <Cane> Not "go to this link and then click download on it".
17:42:41 <motbob> oh ok

17:42:58 <Cane> Used to be more common, it's being phased out.
