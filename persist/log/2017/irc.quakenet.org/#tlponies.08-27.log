03:44:34 <Camail> legally obligated for twitch to hunt people down, but they know its a losing battle
03:44:41 <Camail> so they do as much as they are obligated to
03:44:55 <Camail> clearly not a human actively seeking out these channels

04:02:02 <Camail> our anthem is less cool
04:02:13 <DuB`> At least it's in ENGLISH.
04:02:16 <Camail> maybe because its in a different language
04:02:31 <Camail> our anthem is actually like...realy fuckin good

04:15:08 <Camail> that was unnecessary 
04:16:35 <Camail> ok so
04:16:38 <Camail> floyd lied
04:16:44 <Camail> he's just playing his normal game
04:16:52 <Camail> which is what he won with which is good
04:18:32 <Camail> wow connor wins round 1
04:18:39 <Crisium> its happening

04:22:08 <Camail> and throw him down
04:22:12 <Camail> wtf connor
04:22:14 <Crisium> lol
04:22:15 <Camail> what are you doing
04:22:27 <Camail> weird round
04:22:38 <Camail> by points probably connor again but thats normal?
04:23:03 <Crisium> i mean, a lot of press says first 4 rounds is mayweather feeling it out
04:23:10 <Crisium> real fight might not be until round 5
04:23:38 <Camail> STOP DOING THAT CONNOR
04:23:43 <Camail> YOU WILL BE DQ'D
04:23:47 <Camail> FOR FUCKS SAKE
04:27:01 <Crisium> hmm
04:28:44 <Camail> gg?
04:29:00 <Camail> connor seems tired
04:30:27 <Camail> floyd looked angry after that
04:30:30 <Camail> first time this match
04:30:37 <Camail> honestly? more exciting than anyone thought it would be
04:30:52 <Crisium> ya for sure
04:31:08 <Crisium> i knew first 4 rounds mayweather wouldnt go for much, but connor doing alright
04:31:16 <Crisium> though the illegal hits are unnerving
04:31:21 <Crisium> worried he gonna lose points
04:33:27 <Camail> connors getting good defense in
04:33:53 <Camail> lmao "no wrestling"
04:34:01 <Crisium> this aint wwe
04:34:38 <Crisium> did not see the round 5 breakout i expected
04:34:45 <Camail> he won it, tho
04:34:48 <Crisium> could he do it?
04:34:52 <Camail> ehhhhh
04:35:00 <Camail> floyd started fighting this round, you could tell
04:35:07 <Crisium> he tried more for sure
04:35:09 <Camail> i think its a matter of stamina
04:35:21 <Camail> connor looks REALLY tired compared to floyd
04:35:25 <Camail> like...wow
04:35:36 <Camail> floyd didnt take water for the first 3 rounds
04:35:43 <Camail> that tells you something
04:36:36 <Camail> gg?

04:53:42 <DuB`> respecc
04:53:44 <Camail> connor came out looking so strong
04:54:03 <Camail> "you're a tough mother fucker"
04:54:07 <Camail> lmao yea floyd he is
04:54:09 <Camail> he really is
04:54:14 <Camail> toughest alive, probably
04:55:55 <Crisium> definitely not a dissapointment.  the result we expected, but a very entertaining journey
04:56:41 <Camail> this FELT like a wrestling match
04:56:46 <Camail> great great narrative through this fight
04:57:41 <Camail> ok connor is a bit salty
04:57:52 <Camail> but now he gets it, what floyd does
04:58:35 <DuB`> Can't imagine spending $100 to watch that.
04:58:37 <DuB`> Sheesh
04:58:43 <DuB`> Cool stuff though.
04:58:45 <Camail> is he crying?
04:58:57 <Camail> DuB`  its just... a culture thing
04:59:07 <Camail> ppl woh watch boxing spend a ton of money on it
05:02:26 <Camail> it was a good stoppage
05:02:38 <Camail> maybe he makes it to another round but they had to stop it
05:02:49 <Crisium> ya it was a good stop
05:03:43 <Camail> this is a bit awkward
05:03:50 <Camail> wounded pride and running circles around the truth
05:04:21 <Crisium> now hes talking to the ref lol
05:04:32 <Camail> the ref was a bit of a prick, honestly
05:04:41 <Camail> at the beginning he didnt need to act like that
05:04:49 <Camail> eye contact with connor only
05:05:30 <Camail> wait wtf there were judges who though the first 3 could go to mayweather?
05:05:33 <Camail> thats dumb
05:05:48 <Crisium> ya they gave 2 out of first 3 to mayweather
05:05:49 <Crisium> i dunno
05:06:16 <Camail> floyd threw 8 punches and that was worth more than connor's work? please
05:06:52 <Camail> everyone wants to say notorious B I G

18:44:38 <carcinisation> you could watch moses play pubg https://go.twitch.tv/wtfmoses
18:45:30 <Runbunny> pubg is very boring game to watch though
18:46:04 <carcinisation> depends who is playing bun
18:46:30 <carcinisation> you could watch sum animu
18:46:43 <carcinisation> i shall go lift things and put them down again
18:47:08 <Runbunny> Streamer was shot in the back from somewhere -> back in queue -> wait on island -> jumps of a plane, lands, gets shot in the back while looting -> back in queue -> wait on island.
18:47:14 <skram> I have advice reif
18:47:30 <Runbunny> I can't really play video games and watch anime at the same time.
18:47:53 <skram> Just let things stay on ground so you went get sweaty
18:47:54 <carcinisation> if you are gaming why do you need stream?
18:48:12 <carcinisation> but getting sweaty is part of it skram
18:48:16 <Runbunny> So I don't feel lonely Reif...

21:53:59 <Runbunny> CCM didn't do the first episode?
21:57:21 <motbob> they probably did pull the raw from nyaa
21:57:50 <motbob> you have to be pretty advanced to get captures from japanese tv stations
21:58:14 <motbob> there's only a few people willing/able to do it and they don't share with everyone
21:58:59 <motbob> in fact there's this whole conspiracy theory based around that called "The Cartel" which theorizes that there's a fansubbing cartel that keeps all the raw sources to themselves so that no one else can fansub
21:59:33 <Camail> an anime yakuza, neat
21:59:56 <DuB`> Do they cut off one of your fingers if you try to leave?
22:00:51 <Camail> i dont entirely understand why ripping from a JP broadcast would be harder than any other tv station, is it not digital?
22:01:21 <Camail> eh, i guess there might be station watermarks you dont want
22:01:30 <motbob> -you have to live in japan
22:01:37 <motbob> -you have to have ripping equipment
22:01:48 <motbob> -you have to be willing to upload 4GB episodes on the regular
22:02:18 <Camail> true enough
22:05:05 <motbob> one manifestation of the Cartel phenomenon is that hiryuu would have much, much higher video quality than CCM if that one guy who posts public netflix rips didn't post them
22:05:32 <motbob> ripping netflix isn't common knowledge, the early episodes of [Asenshi] LWA didn't even have netflix video
22:06:05 <motbob> if anyone had wanted to compete with asenshi for some reason, they would have been stuck with really shitty japanese broadcast video
22:06:17 <motbob> unless they had connections
22:07:54 <Camail> It seems impossibly hard to have connections, judging by the price of dvd/blu-ray sets, companies dont like when people are able to effectively store and distribute anime on the internet
22:08:09 <Bio> how went the stak dot
22:08:37 <Bio> dub <3
22:08:50 <motbob> by connections i just mean connections within the fansubbing scene

23:27:09 <DuB`> I blame dot.
23:27:15 <Camail> maybe its because you stayed up too late
