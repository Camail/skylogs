00:00:00 <CockRoach|42> :(
00:10:32 <reification> night all
00:29:21 <Camail> dub pls
00:29:54 <Camail> we played an aids game
00:29:57 <Camail> a truly aids game
01:20:28 <Bio> GG
01:20:34 <Camail> bio your biggest hurdle is mental
01:20:46 <Camail> if you can solve that you could get way better
01:20:47 <Bio> I know
01:21:01 <Bio> I am pretty sure i've said this before
01:21:15 <Bio> If I feel like i'm letting my team down it gets me hard
01:21:20 <Bio> Kappa
01:21:27 <Bio> it hits me hard*
01:21:33 <Camail> why not both
01:21:39 <Camail> you seem like a sub
01:23:00 <Bio> lel
01:23:35 <Camail> well, it's certainly a large barrier... 
01:23:58 <Bio> Its probably why I liked swimming so much
01:24:26 <Bio> It was still a team sport, but races were individual, if I fucked up, I only fucked up my race
01:24:43 <Camail> like, i feel bad when i let people down, but not cripplingly so
01:24:50 <Camail> well, maybe thats not the mental barrier you break
01:25:18 <Camail> you seem to get overwhelmed and paniced sometimes, thats the easier mountain to climb
01:25:39 <Camail> and if you know how to play, even if you feel bad you can take a deep breath, and refocus
01:25:51 <Camail> i do that in the middle of the round a few times now
01:26:18 <Camail> ever since i came back, before peaking in a high impact situation, i just take half a second and breath 
01:26:55 <Camail> but as soon as you start feeling lost then theirs nothing to help you get out of it
01:26:59 <Camail> there's
01:27:27 <Bio> yeah
01:27:46 <Camail> also i was laughing because 1. that was hilarious and 2. I had to immediately resolve by anger and instead of being angry i just laughed
01:27:54 <Camail> mostly 1 tho
01:28:11 <Bio> Makes sense
01:28:23 <Bio> should have just stuck it
01:28:29 <Bio> pros don't fake
01:28:32 <Camail> watching pro matches really helps you learn angles
01:28:36 <Camail> well, also you were safe
01:28:42 <Camail> you came from ct and it was a safe plant
01:29:30 <Camail> 99% of quick thinking in this game is experience
01:29:39 <Camail> you've already thought about and have played this situation out before
01:29:51 <Camail> when its not new its easy to speed through the same old parts
01:30:36 <Bio> yeah
01:45:03 <Bio> SOLUTION: TAKE IN SOME AIR AND FUCKIN SLAY SOME BITCHES, HOPEFULLY THE ONES NOT ON UR TEAM
01:51:43 <motbob> <marttorn> aocowns is still raging about balance in the Letting off steam thread
01:51:50 <motbob> <marttorn> its so weird
01:51:50 <motbob> <marttorn> he was doing this when I joined TL in 2011
01:51:50 <motbob> <marttorn> I was 13 yrs old
01:51:59 <motbob> <marttorn> Now it's almost six years later, i'm a completely different person, 
01:51:59 <motbob> <marttorn> i have a girlfriend, i'm on my way to being one of the best young classical singers in norway
01:51:59 <motbob> <marttorn> i'm addicted to nicotine
01:51:59 <motbob> <marttorn> i've moved away from home

02:50:01 <DuB`> Wind is great, he'll be part of your necro team later.
02:50:17 <DuB`> Nah, I always recommend keeping one copy of every nat4 you get.
02:50:33 <Rawr|Phone> Are you pones being nerds
02:50:37 <Bio> yes
02:50:39 <Bio> are you?
02:50:46 <DuB`> Balance patches can always make a previously-lackluster nat4 something fantastic.
02:51:15 <DuB`> Water kung fu girl used to be considered "food", but now she's the single best raid dps unit and everyone who didn't keep theirs is sad. :P
