01:03:18 <Camail> hollow knight is a really good game!
01:03:31 <Camail> I'm totally gonna buy it
01:04:20 <Dot`> it looks good
01:05:20 <Phearlock> Yeah I'm not usually enticed by 2D platformers
01:05:23 <Phearlock> but it seems really ncie
01:15:28 <Camail> its really content rich
01:16:00 <Camail> but very much a 2d platformer
01:33:15 <Phearlock> It's not that I don't like 2D platformers
01:33:20 <Phearlock> I just suck balls at them
01:34:09 <Camail> well I'm only like 5 hours in, but its been quite easy
01:34:22 <Camail> some snags, but overall not threatening
01:34:52 <Camail> the healing mechanics are what lessen most of the difficulty 
01:35:42 <Camail> everything is very adorable
01:35:50 <Camail> and they fake language is equally as adorable
01:40:18 <Dot`> cam i am confised
01:40:25 <Dot`> <Camail> I'm totally gonna buy it
01:40:32 <Camail> i pirated it
01:40:35 <Dot`> <Camail> well I'm only like 5 hours in, but its been quite easy
01:40:36 <Dot`> ahhhhh
01:40:57 <Dot`> see how i forget about pirating no longer being third world
01:41:11 <Camail> well
01:41:13 <Camail> mainly because UK
01:41:21 <Camail> because lul you guys dont get to pirate shit
01:42:52 <Dot`> life is hard
01:48:58 <Camail> its on GoG so its really easy to torrent
01:49:27 <Camail> it says gamepad is recommended but i dunno
01:50:07 <Camail> the movement feels digital so its not like using a joystick is the most useful
02:06:14 <Camail> i could do that p2p irc thing
02:06:23 <Camail> i remember doing that a few years ago
02:06:32 <Camail> so weird to use ancient network tech

09:02:35 <Micen|Droid> hello
09:03:08 <Micen|Droid> That is pretty good. I'm saving that one
09:05:43 <Micen|Droid> I need to be up for the day in just under two hours. Do I nap or just stay up and get a red bull in the middle of the day
09:09:39 <motbob> NAP
09:10:16 <motbob> it's always better to get any sleep
09:10:31 <motbob> unless you have no faith in yourself to get out of bed
09:10:37 <Micen> I have no faith 
09:11:03 <Micen> When I sleep I crash for 9 to 12 hours.
09:11:35 <Micen> but if I nap on the couch...
09:12:05 <Micen> or since im not driving, nap in the car. 
09:12:20 <Micen> i think ill do that one.

09:50:18 <Micen> How are you today?
09:51:07 <DoT_> tired atm
09:51:09 <DoT_> you?
09:51:19 <Micen> tired. havent been to sleep
09:51:43 <Micen> did not plan out my night as well as I should have

10:04:51 <Micen> chillin out
10:04:55 <Micen> maxin'
10:04:59 <Micen> relaxin' all cool
10:12:57 <DoT_> micen, finding a silver ancestry dragonborn cleric portrait is hard
10:13:11 <DoT_> or any art of one really that isnt bad
10:17:59 <Micen> is this a request?
10:18:31 <Micen> I mean, I can certainly try, and it is just outside of my comfort zone
10:19:20 <DoT_> no , i was just lamenting my struggle
10:19:47 <DoT_> but if you want the challange i guess, go for it
10:19:47 <Micen> ill see what I can come up with
10:20:53 <DoT_> for refrance this is a silver dragon
10:20:55 <DoT_> http://brassdragon.deviantart.com/art/Silver-Dragon-with-blue-pen-96172025
10:21:16 <DoT_> offical DnD art on dragonborn is about 2 pictures
10:21:26 <DoT_> the struggle is real
10:21:38 <Micen> i know dragons. Ex-guildie from wow
10:21:39 <Micen> http://neondragon.deviantart.com/
10:21:58 <Micen> granted that was like a decade ago, but still good dragon references!
10:22:48 <DoT_> time to head down to charity store for volunteer work, where phone reception is practicly dead

22:35:50 <Dot`> Moana is a nice movie
22:36:20 <Runbunny> I like the pig character.
22:36:27 <Runbunny> It's cutesy.

22:45:54 <reification> he is clearly tsundere runbun
22:47:31 <skrma> you're all terrible
22:50:00 <Runbunny> That is just the way it is.
22:50:54 <Runbunny> I'm pretty upset.
22:51:15 <Runbunny> twitter changed something and now I need to make an account to see nsfw pictures.
22:55:30 <reification> twitter has been actively shitting up their site for some time now
22:59:48 <motbob> hmm
23:01:01 <motbob> hiding nsfw pictures from prying eyes is exactly the kind of move that will allow a site to offer the ability to see nsfw pictures in the future
23:01:42 <motbob> I have seen NSFW pictures on tumblr juxtaposed against ads for Starburst or whatever
23:01:59 <motbob> i tend to wonder, "Does Starburst know that this is where their ads are going"
