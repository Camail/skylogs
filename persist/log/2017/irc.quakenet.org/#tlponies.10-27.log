08:23:55 <Camail> dying light was quite fun
08:24:06 <Camail> also has multiplayer for the campaign
08:25:02 <Camail> Soma is a pretty good spooky game
08:25:24 <Dot`> i recall ppl liking soma when it came out
08:25:49 <Camail> shadow of mordor is $8, certainly worth that
08:26:03 <Camail> shadow of war is 95% SoM anyway so its basically like playing the new one
08:27:14 <Dot`> thats actually kind of sad
08:28:58 <Dot`> .tell dub` https://imgur.com/gallery/Jrrlu
08:29:42 <Camail> Freedom Planet is an indie retro sonic clone with more cool stuff
08:29:53 <Camail> if you liked sonic then thats worth a look
08:30:56 <Camail> Antichamber is $4, which is a fucking great game
08:31:15 <Dot`> i pirated that years ago, never finished it
08:31:32 <Camail> easily my favorite puzzle game
08:31:49 <Camail> the first polished game to really take advantage of how video games work
08:32:40 <Camail> torchlight is $4, i honestly might buy that
08:32:49 <Dot`> i see talos principle is on sale, people said that was good when it came out
08:34:09 <Camail> yea, its a puzzle game, kinda high concept
08:34:28 <Camail> i dont mix philosophy and gaming so i have 0 interest
08:34:38 <Camail> but it was received quite well
08:51:44 <Camail> sleep

22:42:09 <Dot`> i aws playing game, now i  am here
22:42:12 <Dot`> you skram?
22:47:53 <skrm> im at work, dot
22:47:54 <skrm> again
22:47:58 <Dot`> right
22:48:10 <Dot`> have you called the postal service to complain
22:48:44 <skrm> someone ate all the leftover pizza and atcha didnt buy eggs, so its bad times
22:48:49 <skrm> not yet no
22:49:08 <skrm> nor did i get a tracking number so someone probably stole it
22:49:27 <Dot`> probably
22:50:58 <Camail> it was dot
22:51:22 <skrm> well thats good
22:51:30 <skrm> as it was sort of the point of the whole thing
23:17:27 <Bio> asdf
23:17:28 <Bio> bek
23:20:26 <Dot`> wb
23:21:32 <reification> night all
23:26:09 <Dot`> gnight
23:30:53 <Camail> HOLY SHIT BIO THIS BOSS
23:31:12 <Bio> lol
23:31:18 <Bio> i'm still ccollecting fires
23:33:04 <Camail> how many have you done
23:33:29 <Camail> also this boss might be the hardest yet
23:33:32 <Camail> ignoring lvl 10 zote
23:33:43 <Camail> cuz like...thats just the same fight but you can never mess up
23:33:48 <Camail> its kinda artificial difficulty
23:33:53 <Bio> i have 2 fires now
23:33:57 <Camail> this one doe, is a doozy
23:34:30 <Camail> i just ran straight to the fires, are you doing this on you completed file or a new one
23:34:45 <Camail> getting the fires was actually pretty simple, fun but simple
23:34:55 <Camail> i imagine doing it during a full playthrough would be fun
23:35:11 <Camail> but despite my love of this game i have no desire to lose all my powers and play again
23:47:15 <Camail> alright so I've manage to land 1 real hit so far in like 5 attempts
23:47:18 <Camail> this is going good
