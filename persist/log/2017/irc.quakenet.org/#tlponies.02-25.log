16:39:55 <DuB`> I'm a bit sick.
16:40:08 <DuB`> Been half-sick for the last three days but was getting better.
16:40:24 <DuB`> ... and then I stayed up until 1am with my friends.
16:40:24 <skram> Better than being a whole lot sick though?
16:40:33 <DuB`> Finally saw mad max, though.
16:40:36 <Dot`> dub please
16:40:37 <DuB`> So WORTH.
16:40:40 <Dot`> dont spend tim ewith people
16:40:48 <Dot`> they are the source of disease
16:40:53 <skram> mad max is so good
16:43:10 <DuB`> I'll be a good boy tonight and go to bed at like 11 and get notsick.
16:43:48 <skram> you're already a good good boy dub
16:43:52 <DuB`> And yes, mad max was perhaps my favorite movie of all time after the first half hour.
16:43:54 <DuB`> Wowowow
16:46:01 <DuB`> Er, by* the first half hour?
16:46:06 <Rawr|Fone> It was meh
16:46:29 <DuB`> Rawr you seem to enjoy being wrong about many things.
16:47:22 <Rawr|Fone> I haven't even seen the movie, I just wanted to have a different opinion
16:47:35 <DuB`> That also sounds very you.

16:51:36 <skram> i recognize too many of these
16:51:52 <Dot`> i wish i didnt recall some of these
16:51:56 <DuB`> Official nerd.
17:00:14 <Dot`> Im so tired dub
17:00:22 <DuB`> Me too, dot. :T
17:00:42 <DuB`> Let's have a TLP naptime.
17:00:50 <skram> Have some relaxin' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ4KNMnTsIs
17:00:51 <motbob> it's unfortunate
17:01:07 <motbob> we've moved away from a set language of memes and into a more freeform world
17:01:20 <motbob> it's too chaotic
17:05:20 <Dot`> bring order to memes
17:05:27 <skram> what do you mean by that
17:05:47 <skram> far as i know, memes were always random jokes that got repeated over and over
17:06:30 <skram> or do you mean like rage comics and images with captions
17:07:22 <skram> i supposed image macros and memes were the same thing for a long while
17:08:45 <DuB`> skram I never knew how many things you could do with sticks!
17:09:12 <skram> primitive technology is the clickspring of cavemen dub
17:09:19 <DuB`> :D
17:09:36 <DuB`> Um!
17:10:01 <DuB`> Can't decide if I want to sickoverwatch today or just chill in warframe with my brother all day again.

17:18:29 <DuB`> It was best for him, he's been struggling.
17:18:53 <DuB`> And he got to have a ton of family there as he was fading which was nice.
