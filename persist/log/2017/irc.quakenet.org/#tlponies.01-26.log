01:05:17 <Golly> its hilarious
01:09:40 <DuB`> How does one do that? :o
01:11:23 <Golly> he took over a catapult with helm of the dominator and runs it around to scout
01:11:52 <Phearlock> So basically he should pick beastmaster
01:12:11 <Golly> or meepo maybe, eventually
01:13:17 <Golly> the fun thing is his mmr is low now because he lack knowledge, but his mechanical skill is high
