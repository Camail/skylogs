08:11:13 <Rawr|Fone> Beep beep
08:11:30 <Micen_> also working on some PV for the stream itself for if i ever decide to strim games as well
08:12:37 <DoT|Phone> tell me a story horses. I don't have a book with me for this bus ride
08:12:53 <DoT|Phone> hey phear
08:13:05 <DoT|Phone> dnd later!
08:14:02 <DoT|Phone> nice Micen
08:14:20 <Micen_> DoT|Phone, Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land.
08:14:32 <Micen_> To do this, the eldest used her unicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for their kingdom and their subjects, all the different types of ponies.
08:14:56 <DoT|Phone> great story
08:18:25 <DoT|Phone> what a story
08:19:11 <DoT|Phone> do you think calestia moves the sun or maintains the planet's orbit
08:21:16 <CockRoach|42> and they took help of a third, unsuspecting pony to do all their dirty work
08:22:26 <DoT|Phone> and made her think it was for her own good
08:23:03 <Micen_> Considering that Twilight when she had super sayian alicorn 3 powers was having trouble holding onto the sun, I think that she is rotating the sun around the planet. 
08:23:27 <Micen_> if it even is a round planet and not some discworld flat earth type thing
08:24:10 <DoT|Phone> so then. is the planet stationary in space or traveling with the rest of the galaxy
08:25:01 <DoT|Phone> not it also could have been twi losing control of the planet
08:25:09 <Emi> is there a galaxy
08:25:11 <DoT|Phone> but
08:25:46 <DoT|Phone> Well there are stars.... but I see your point
08:26:02 <Micen_> Planet is stationary, which would also make the fact the pegasui have to make wind for their planet  
08:26:09 <Micen_> make the fact make sense
08:26:38 <DoT|Phone> celestia is basically holding the planet ransom
08:27:07 <Micen_> all the unicorns of equestria had to do it before. Now that she holds that power, it keeps her kingdom safe. 
08:28:35 <DoT|Phone> pony lore is complex
08:28:42 <Micen_> Equestria seems to be safe even with species that evolved as predators like the catburds, dragons, and yaks present
08:29:04 <Micen_> She uses her power to give light as the ultimate tool to keep them in check.
08:29:51 <Micen_> putting some thought into it, it can be. But i am also of the opinion that its just a cartoon in a fantasy land that doesn't have this much logic supporting it. 
08:30:56 <DoT|Phone> yea but I have nothing else to do on this bus ride
08:31:17 <Micen_> become pony author dot. 
08:31:54 <DoT|Phone> The lore and physics behind the Sun.
08:32:26 <Micen_> Does their sun even radiate heat? Is this a thing that is controlled? 
08:33:23 <Micen_> Because if its controlled, Why didnt the unicorn tribe use it to melt the eternal winter that was plaguing them? If It cant be, is Celestia just screwing around and moving it farther away from the surface of the planet?
08:33:32 <Phearlock> Ponies have been shown to chill with sun shades, and those mirrory things people use to reflect more sun onto themselves for tanning.
08:33:52 <Phearlock> So I assume it does give off heat or at least some form of radiation.

08:34:05 <Phearlock> can it be controlled in terms of output? don'tknow
08:34:05 <Micen_> Good points Phear. 
08:34:18 <Micen_> cute pons CR
08:34:33 <DoT|Phone> but the weather has been shown to be effected by the ponies mental state to each other
08:34:41 <DoT|Phone> eternal winter
08:35:04 <DoT|Phone> so some mixture of Sun heat and magic

08:36:50 <Phearlock> depends on how you think of the windigos
08:37:15 <Phearlock> if they were the thing that usually bring excessive winter and are drawn towards negative emotions.
08:37:22 <DoT|Phone> true
08:37:44 <Phearlock> Or if the climate was caused by the negative emotions and they just really like both cold weather and bad company.
08:41:07 <Micen|droid> I think I'm gonna go watch some hulu  for a bit. Be back in a few hours
08:41:17 <DoT|Phone> later Micen
08:41:46 <DoT|Phone> I can only assume he means hula hooping
08:42:06 <CockRoach|42> that is the most probable assumption

22:27:36 <reification> it was ppl disconnecting after we had an easy winning round 1 D:
22:27:46 <reification> then losing cause 5v6
22:29:11 <DuB`> Well that's silly of them.
22:29:45 <DuB`> You should bully someone into pocket mercy for you and win with pharah.

23:35:29 <Dot`> http://imgur.com/gallery/pPT56fR
23:35:44 <Phearlock> We had some NPCs die
23:35:50 <Dot`> poor cook
23:35:53 <Phearlock> and some of us came pretty close to die
23:36:27 <Phearlock> cooked cook

23:38:30 <Phearlock> Really happy we got so much use out of the spiky thorn area spell haha
23:38:46 <reification> that was a pretty srs spell
23:39:16 <Dot`> that viny thing was amazing
23:39:34 <Phearlock> In hindsight, I think casting fog cloud right before we released the barrels might have been the better opener.
23:39:48 <Phearlock> but it's hard to tell

23:43:46 <Dot`> yea, it worked out well with the spike growth
23:44:00 <Dot`> could have cast it maybe earlier? its camo isnt it
23:44:11 <Phearlock> yeah I could have cast it earlier too
23:44:29 <Phearlock> Wasn't fast enough
23:44:57 <Dot`> there was probably many things we could have doe better haha
23:45:04 <Phearlock> yes lol
23:45:06 <Phearlock> But it's ok
23:45:10 <Phearlock> we had fun, we won fight
23:45:21 <Phearlock> I think biggest mistake was cook though.
23:45:28 <Phearlock> plz do not charge, alone, at the enemy line.
23:45:47 <Phearlock> As he clearly demonstrated, it is not a smart thing.
23:48:51 <Camail> https://www.facebook.com/Crunchyroll/videos/10154864750554340/
23:49:09 <Bio> anime was a mistake
23:51:01 <Dot`> maybe phear he was meant to be a demonstration to skram
23:51:06 <Phearlock> lol
