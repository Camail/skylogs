00:51:40 <skram> Dot, I know you miss the good old days of apartheid, but you need to move on
00:51:59 <DoT`> you dont know how good we had it skram
00:52:35 <DoT`> clean beachs, cheap labour, emergency food source
00:52:54 <Camail> did you bring up pineapple just so you could segue into slavery

01:27:28 <Crisium> BW team finals were today, if you watch nothing else, watch the ace match, best BW game iv seen this year by far
01:27:31 <Crisium> https://youtu.be/hdHWCuXlueE?t=2h9m56s
01:27:34 <Crisium> Flash vs Soulkey
01:27:52 <Crisium> such a craft of stars
01:28:46 <Camail> what does artosis do now
01:28:48 <Camail> other than this
01:29:09 <Crisium> i guess it pays the bills
01:29:52 <Camail> he has to have a behind the scenes job
01:29:57 <Camail> having a kid is expensive
01:30:54 <Crisium> time to get patreon
01:31:14 <Crisium> BW commentating is so random though
01:31:19 <Crisium> usually artosis and rapid
01:31:22 <Crisium> sometimes tastosis
01:31:25 <DoT`> wonder what he charges events like wcs to caste the finals
01:31:26 <Crisium> sometimes rapid and wolf
01:31:32 <Crisium> one time was rapid solo

21:51:12 <Camail> what if all his friends are really really fat
21:51:20 <Dot`> very
21:51:24 <motbob> "what if he dies while signing the divorce papers"
21:51:36 <Camail> or the truck was carrying volatile chemicals
21:52:04 <motbob> i think if he dies after he starts signing, there's a valid agreement between husband and wife, expressed in writing
21:52:20 <motbob> his assent is there on the page
21:52:30 <Dot`> so many variables
21:52:30 <Camail> how much of the signature needs to be there
21:52:40 <motbob> i think a molecule of ink
21:52:58 <Camail> she could forge that
21:53:01 <Camail> conspiracy!
21:53:17 <motbob> she'd have no reason to
21:53:26 <DuB`> She wouldn't want to. :P
21:53:27 <DuB`> Yeah
21:53:27 <motbob> since she gets everything if he dies during marriage
21:53:28 <DuB`> hahah
21:54:07 <DuB`> Also for the tax question filing jointly as married is by far preferable!
21:54:14 <Camail> what if his living will gave everything to his current ex wife
21:54:23 <Camail> who sued to be his previous wife
21:54:28 <Camail> but is now her
21:54:34 <motbob> ?
21:55:05 <Camail> if his living will was explicitly "give everything to my ex-wife" but no other details!
21:55:12 <Camail> I'm writing a soap opera
21:55:22 <Camail> so she kills him and forges the divorce papers
21:55:23 <motbob> umm
21:55:27 <Camail> thus making her the ex-wife
21:55:27 <motbob> i think in that case
21:55:40 <motbob> they would define ex-wife as of the day he wrote the will
21:55:42 <Camail> depriving his original love of the assets he accrued from his political wedding
21:56:20 <Camail> sorry mot there's just not enough precedence, i guess we'll just have to chalk this up to an unknown mystery of life, tsk tsk
21:56:26 <motbob> so the will would be interpreted as meaning a wife that's not the wife signing the death divorce papers
21:56:38 <Camail> i wonder if anyone actually does that
21:56:59 <Camail> creates convoluted thought experiments for law, then falls back on lack of precedent 
21:57:38 <motbob> there's usually precedent
21:57:38 <Yolteotl> pon pon pon
21:57:50 <motbob> because a lot of principles in law are general
21:58:08 <motbob> it's pretty hard to find a case where you don't know how a court will decide if you prove all the facts you need
21:58:20 <motbob> the fight's in the facts
22:01:34 <Dot`> cam, samurai jack yet?
22:01:40 <Camail> noooooooo
22:01:43 <Camail> I'll find it now
22:03:25 <Camail> downloading now
22:03:36 <Camail> man, i have the entirety of FMA:B on my hdd
22:03:40 <Camail> and is till  havent watched it
22:03:44 <Camail> i got 2 episodes in 
22:03:48 <Camail> and i really really want to!
22:04:42 <reification> i am return
22:05:12 <reification> i watched the original FMA and feel no urge to watch :B
22:05:15 <DuB`> Hi return
22:05:46 <skrma> IM DAD
22:05:56 <Camail> but brotherhood is so good
22:06:03 <Camail> honestly just what I've seen i like more
22:06:28 <Dot`> I always here FMA:B is far better
22:06:43 <Dot`> but i too watched the original and just havnt got around to watching B
22:06:48 <Dot`> hear*
22:07:03 <skrma> whats fma
22:07:19 <Camail> full metal animoo
22:07:25 <Camail> alchemist
22:08:26 <Runbunny> What is this anime talk?
22:08:59 <Camail> fucking
22:09:02 <Camail> go back in the hole
22:09:17 <Camail> also i would like to point out i never watched through every single episode of sam jack
22:09:41 <Camail> i watched it on CN
22:09:47 <Camail> so it was very out of order and missing pieces
22:10:08 <Camail> and i have no desire to go back and watch it, despite very much loving my memories of it
22:10:47 <motbob> fma:b is the greatest anime of all time
22:10:52 <motbob> probably
22:11:14 <motbob> it's like 60 episodes long, right? and it never gets bad
22:11:31 <motbob> it's basically a miracle
22:12:11 <Camail> it helps that they had a completed manga
22:12:24 <Camail> imagine if bleach had that, maybe they wouldn't have gone nuts
22:13:06 <motbob> well mangas usually get bad
22:13:27 <motbob> at that length
22:13:34 <reification> good anime over 26 eps is damn ra1hbGlnbjpsZWZ0O30NCmg0e2NvbG9yOiM2MDYwNjAgICFpbXBvcnRhbnQ7Zm9u

22:28:26 <Camail> and its been a nagging injury for like a month
22:28:35 <Camail> so typing is starting to hurt right now
22:28:45 <DuB`> Amputate.
22:28:50 <Camail> f u
22:28:58 <Runbunny> Are the things you have heard: Toothbrush? Shower scene? I bit  my tongue? I said with a posed look?
22:29:11 <Camail> oh right is that the incest one
22:29:15 <DuB`> Friggin' toothbrush...
22:29:27 <Camail> nvm wont watch
22:29:35 <reification> lol
22:29:39 <skrma> ??
22:29:45 <Runbunny> You should watch it regardless.
22:29:46 <Dot`> oh the toothbrush
22:30:10 <Camail> run, no
22:30:19 <Camail> incest belongs in hentai, not anime
22:30:32 <Dot`> i feel seeing a gif of the toothbrush scene was enough
22:31:26 <reification> you haven’t got the full experience then dot
22:31:50 <DuB`> Unless it was an awfully long gif.
22:31:55 <Camail> it was
22:32:13 <Camail> like 60 seconds of a guy giving his sister tooth orgasms
22:32:14 <Runbunny> You need the sound as well
22:32:25 <Camail> RUN WE DO NOT NEED THE SOUND AS WELL
22:32:28 <Dot`> I did not succeed in watchign the whole gif
22:32:40 <DuB`> Bahaha
22:33:09 <reification> it’s in nisemonogatari, so you could just watch bakemonogatari
22:34:20 <Runbunny> reification, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdkCwcFmz3s
22:34:26 <Runbunny> That freaking face
22:34:29 <Runbunny> it's so good
22:35:06 <reification> have you listened to the commentary track runbun
22:35:14 <Runbunny> I have not
22:38:46 <reification> see this runbun http://theeasternstandard.blogspot.co.uk/2009/09/bakemonogatari-in-character-commentary.html
22:41:08 <Camail> i think i might change to the m4a4
22:41:23 <Camail> having to relearn 2 sprays is annoying
22:41:39 <Camail> and the a4 and ak have basically the same 5 bullet pattern

22:43:57 <Dot`> cane, isnt the new Mount and Blade out soon?
22:45:14 <Cane> Yes, soon(tm). Far as I know the release date is "2017".
22:45:15 <Cane> So, there's that.
22:45:25 <Cane> I'm worried though.
22:45:44 <Cane> Taleworlds were looking into DRM for Bannerlord, and Denuvo specifically.
22:45:52 <Cane> At which point it's a no-buy from me, if it really does use Denuvo.
22:45:56 <Cane> Sicne it literally couldn't be modded.
22:45:59 <Dot`> ?ohdear
22:46:35 <Dot`> why do ppl ruin everything cane
22:46:55 <Dot`> we shoud remove all ppl from armStalker dev before it happens there too
22:48:15 <Cane> Hahah, better to let it be a "what could have been" than what the end result is likely to be?
22:48:21 <Cane> I didn't know you were this cynical Dot`. <3
22:49:25 <Rawr|Fone> You didn't?
22:49:33 <Dot`> we can visit a third world country one day cane and you too can experince ppl
22:49:40 <Rawr|Fone> Do you really know dot cane
22:52:52 <Micen> good morning
