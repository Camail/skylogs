05:41:27 <motbob> If you want to look at the sun (during the eclipse or anytime) just shout directly at the sun. The sound waves will cancel out the sun waves because they are both waves. 
05:42:10 <motbob> Don't point your fingers at the sun during the eclipse. It could result in you losing complete feeling in your fingers leaving you no way to read Braille.
06:02:07 <Rawr|Fone> Good advice motbob

18:46:34 <Bio> I got a good look, no clouds. The dots are going away now =D
18:48:18 <Camail> the clouds weren't thick enough to block it, i actually have some protective glasses but the light wasnt strong enough to be scene through them
18:48:47 <Camail> so i use naked eye + the blue tinted uv protection on my car's front window
18:48:55 <Camail> worked out really well
18:49:07 <Camail> where i live was only a 80% coverage but it was still cool
