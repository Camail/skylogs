04:01:58 <ZK> i kinda want to become better at sc2. And I kinda know what i need to do. But training doesnt sound that fun

04:03:06 <Bio> yeh!

04:03:59 <Bio> point and click adventure
04:04:06 <DuB`> 1. Play more
04:04:10 <ZK> well, actually just learning what each character does would help
04:04:13 <DuB`> 2. Learn heroes and maps
04:04:17 <DuB`> ... yeah. x)
04:04:29 <ZK> guess learning maps would help
04:04:34 <Bio> nah
04:04:40 <ZK> but im not used to 3d maps and learning where to move on em
04:04:51 <Bio> just think of high ground like ramps
