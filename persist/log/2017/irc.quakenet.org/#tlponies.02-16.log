20:54:13 <skram> hmm impossible
20:54:16 <DuB`> I dun even know what that is.
20:54:28 <skram> it seems very self-explanatory?
20:54:30 <Runbunny> https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Runbunny
20:54:33 <DuB`> But MAL means BAD in spanish.
20:54:33 <skram> its a list
20:54:34 <Runbunny> There you go.
20:54:36 <skram> of my animes
20:54:56 <skram> that is entirely intentional dub
20:55:00 <DuB`> SKRAM'S animes?
20:55:00 <skram> because anime was a mistake

20:56:15 <reification> did you read the nisioisin book?
20:56:33 <Runbunny> xxxholic is really good.
20:56:49 <reification> i would say it’s by clamp dub but i’m not sure that helps
20:56:57 <Runbunny> I really liked Clamp shows.
20:57:01 <DuB`> Hentai with clamps!?
20:57:07 <Micen|Droid> Clamp is good
20:57:10 <Runbunny> Sure is.
20:57:13 <Runbunny> Dub
20:57:17 <Micen|Droid> Chobits is the best
20:57:26 <Runbunny> What you need to find in my list is "Golden Boy"
20:57:27 <reification> ccs is best magical girl show
20:57:33 <DuB`> Is chobits that dumb porndroid one?
20:57:47 <DuB`> Or something.
20:57:54 <reification> wow dub rude
20:57:58 <Micen|Droid> It started as that, then kinda went Asimov
