00:12:57 <DuB`> Packed venue for mario. :o
00:26:00 <Dot`> .roll d20 to boop dub
00:28:00 <DuB`> Hi dot.
00:28:20 <Dot`> hows it going dubs
00:30:42 <ZK> he's doign well
00:30:44 <ZK> he has no homework
00:30:53 <DuB`> For one day! Hallelujah!
00:31:25 <Dot`> \o/
00:33:38 <ZK> the mario bros is fun
00:36:23 <Crisium> lol todays bw game
00:37:47 <Dot`> i saw some
00:38:22 <ZK> i feel bad for that top player
00:38:30 <ZK> i heard he was good
00:39:29 <Crisium> stork is arguably top 2 ever
00:39:33 <Crisium> top 2 toss*
00:39:38 <Crisium> but he got owned lol
00:39:42 <Crisium> my fav player, so sad to see
00:39:59 <Crisium> but he also came back to BW only in like November, so it will take a while
00:40:25 <ZK> who else would fight for top 2? Bisu and...? Other dragons?
00:41:28 <Crisium> probably #1 Bisu #2 Stork #3 Nal_rA
00:41:47 <Crisium> ra was an older player, but was the best player of his race until bisu and stork came around
00:42:23 <Crisium> but stork could be considered #1 since he was more consistant than bisu
00:42:39 <Crisium> bisu at his best was certainly better than stork, but he had lower lows than stork
00:42:45 <Crisium> depends how you view careers
00:44:15 <Golly> jangbi?
00:46:55 <Crisium> jangbi had a very high peak skill level, but he only demonstrated it a few times imo
00:47:26 <Crisium> he was also considered one of the worst players at the time before his first OSL win, so he has that against him
00:48:40 <Crisium> there was a good TL post on that a bit ago
00:49:10 <Crisium> basically jangbi had the highest potential of any protoss, but he only demonstrated this at select times, and at other times choked and lost horribly
00:49:14 <Crisium> too inconistant
00:49:38 <Crisium> horrible losing streaks, and no tournament pushes for years before he won OSL
00:49:57 <Golly> I see, I only mentioned him because i remembered him winning an osl or something towards the end of the bw era
00:50:20 <Phearlock> lol rip andrewG(G)
00:50:28 <Crisium> oh hes up there for sure Golly, you're right
00:50:32 <Crisium> but not top 2 imo
00:51:57 <Phearlock> Reach obviously best
00:52:14 <Phearlock> at 2v2
00:52:19 <Crisium> top 5 without a doubt even in 1v1
00:52:25 <Crisium> he was the only good protoss before nal_ra
00:52:30 <Crisium> and was good even years after
00:53:11 <Crisium> in peak skill levels the 6 dragons are the best, for for the time reach and nal_ra are higher than most of them in "best ever" imo
00:53:25 <Crisium> but for their time*

02:27:40 <Bio> dub
02:27:49 <Bio> i feel like im making zero progress in dummoners war
02:28:05 <DuB`> Hmm
02:28:26 <DuB`> Oke
02:28:37 <DuB`> 1. Be working on dark ifrit fusion
02:28:48 <Bio> k
02:28:52 <Bio> i got the dark yetu
02:28:52 <DuB`> He's most important thing in game until you've been playing for like... a year.
02:29:01 <DuB`> 2. Be working on your giants team.
02:29:03 <DuB`> Let's seee
02:29:19 <DuB`> I saw, you got dark yeti and bella. :D
02:29:23 <DuB`> Very gewd
02:30:20 <DuB`> Your first giants team will probably be Vero, Emma, Bella, Shannon, Bernard
02:30:22 <DuB`> Er 
02:30:22 <DuB`> Uh
02:30:42 <DuB`> Dark ifrit, water neo agent, light inu, wind pixie, and wind griffon
02:31:08 <Bio> hokay
02:31:20 <DuB`> All of those have super standard rune builds you can look up pretty easily, too.
02:32:37 <Bio> do I use the big fire dog
02:32:44 <Bio> for something
02:34:07 <DuB`> Ehhh
02:34:32 <DuB`> Don't really need him for anything.
02:34:48 <DuB`> If you reeaaally just want to build a damage dealer for fun then you can work on him.
02:35:07 <DuB`> He won't help any actual progression though.
02:35:44 <DuB`> Ifrit and bella should probably be your fir 6*
02:36:07 <Bio> hokay
02:37:48 <DuB`> first*
02:37:55 <DuB`> Dunno where the second half of that word went. >_>
02:38:13 <Bio> I got a blue cat lady from an orange scroll
02:38:17 <Bio> w/ purple stars
02:38:26 <Bio> so fancy
02:39:42 <Bio> apparenly she's for the blue bird fusion
02:39:45 <Bio> noice
02:39:46 <DuB`> Ooh, she's used in water pheonix fusion.
02:39:48 <DuB`> Ya
02:43:20 <Bio> guess i need to upgrade skills on bella too
02:45:01 <Bio> should i use my dark things
02:48:10 <DuB`> Dark wot
02:48:13 <DuB`> Oh devilmon?
02:48:24 <DuB`> Nah, save those for skillups that are really hard to get.
02:48:32 <DuB`> Bella you can just skill up by getting other inugamis.
02:48:45 <DuB`> Use devilmon on ifrit, neo agent etc.
02:49:13 <Bio> okie
