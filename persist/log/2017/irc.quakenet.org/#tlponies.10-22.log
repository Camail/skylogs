00:19:33 <Dot`> gee, i wonder why
00:20:54 <reification> night all
00:21:17 <Dot`> gnight reif
00:23:03 <reification> dot saudi arabia got put on the un womenâ€™s rights commissionâ€¦
00:23:29 <skrm> Maybe they'll learn something
00:24:07 <reification> well they are finally letting them drive iirc
00:25:25 <skrm> thats true
00:39:51 <Dot`> i believe that was explained that the people from saudi who got the position where part of the group for womens right
00:40:09 <Dot`> and that was a move to give them more influence in thier country
00:47:51 <DuB`> das good
00:51:45 <Dot`> where as Mugabe has been given a position because he has according to them made his country better????
00:52:01 <Dot`> to start with he is a Dictator
00:52:20 <Dot`> Zim use to be one of the main food exporters of the world and is now starving
00:52:29 <Dot`> white farmers are still being killed
00:52:35 <Dot`> and with his blessing
00:53:18 <Dot`> the country econamy failed so bad thier currency stopped existing
00:54:26 <skrm> Is Mugabe not also the dude that said child abuse was ok but only if its a girl
00:54:38 <Dot`> probably
00:54:41 <skrm> In an interview with Stephen Fry

02:45:05 <Micen|droid> I had company today for like an hour
02:45:08 <BioPhone> Factorio probably
02:45:28 <Micen|droid> Unexpected, but an old friend. That was good 
02:47:45 <Micen|droid> Never heard of it. Any good bio? 
02:48:33 <BioPhone> It's an automation simulator. It's pretty fun
02:48:46 <BioPhone> Can be pretty mindbending

10:07:35 <Dot`> hey tredc
10:07:46 <Micen> good morning horses
10:09:15 <Micen> Does anyone want to watch this goofy thing? my brother is going to be putting up a synctube of it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_People,_Dear_Reader
10:13:51 <Micen> https://cytu.be/r/Oubliette
10:27:41 <tredc> gg
10:34:25 <Dot`> yolt pon
10:34:27 <Dot`> what you up to
10:35:09 <Yolteotl> waiting soccer
10:35:15 <Yolteotl> at 3pm 
10:35:15 <Yolteotl> :p
10:36:41 <Dot`> the kickball
10:43:50 <Yolteotl> yes
10:44:00 <Yolteotl> my team is 18th / 20 at the moment
10:44:05 <Yolteotl> first league is hard
10:44:48 <Micen> do a win
10:45:07 <Yolteotl> I'm just supporting them :D
10:46:26 <Micen> pull a Remi Gaillard and pretend to be  a part of the team
10:46:33 <Yolteotl> ahaha
10:46:39 <Yolteotl> You know Remi Gaillard?
10:46:43 <Micen> yeah
10:46:51 <Yolteotl> great :D
10:47:06 <Yolteotl> they did an epic 3-3 against Marseille last week
10:47:14 <Yolteotl> almost won
10:48:58 <Micen> my state might be getting a proper soccer team in like two years. 
10:49:13 <Micen> they are building a Stadium just for soccer. 
10:49:20 <Micen> so even if no team we can get games. 
10:49:35 <Yolteotl> that's great, sad america doesn't like more non american sports
10:49:43 <Micen> its growing. 
10:50:36 <Micen> Its going to be fun to watch the US national team in the next few weeks since we didnt make it into the world up. 
10:51:24 <Yolteotl> https://youtu.be/NBgpsa5MoOM?t=896 hope you'll get something like this crowd one day :D
10:51:31 <Micen> Coach fired.  and speculation that there is going to be a complete new team
10:54:26 <Micen> and that would be fun. Closest things that happen like that are Pro wrestling fans
10:55:43 <Yolteotl> yes, soccer is so apart. 
10:56:06 <Yolteotl> I think the fact you only score 1 or twice in a game makes it special
10:56:21 <Micen> Well we have hockey which is like that as well
10:56:39 <Micen> unless you are my team, where we score 3 or more points a game
10:56:39 <Yolteotl> (even if the whole thing can be boring sometimes :DD)
10:57:55 <Micen> But soccer can be silly and close to wrestling with the over selling of the smallest taps or trips to try and get people carded 
10:58:58 <Yolteotl> yes, I saw, even if I don't like wrestling :P
10:59:30 <Yolteotl> *see
11:03:52 <Micen> wrestling is fun when you dont take it seriously. 
11:04:24 <tredc> gg
11:09:04 <Yolteotl> not sure how wrestling fans take it
11:09:27 <Yolteotl> I'm always thinking about South park having fun of those fans :D

17:31:54 <Phearlock> hi!
17:32:04 <Micen> how are you phear?
17:32:24 <Phearlock> Cozy
17:32:46 <Yolteotl> Hi Micen 
17:33:04 <Yolteotl> you the american, should I move to your country? 
17:33:36 <carcinisation> micen is in quite a different bit iirc
17:33:45 <Yolteotl> of course
17:33:47 <Yolteotl> but still
17:33:52 <Yolteotl> :D
17:33:54 <Micen> For what reason would you be moving? and where, east coast, west cost, mid west?
17:34:08 <Yolteotl> job, California
17:34:30 <Micen> That should be good. but it is expensive out west. 
17:34:42 <skram> move to the mississippi delta
17:34:44 <skram> make moonshine
17:34:59 <Micen> move to Kentucky, make Bourbon.
17:35:26 <Micen> at least advise Yolt to be classy skram. :P
17:35:45 <skram> im trying to do the opposite
17:38:11 <Yolteotl> My company is not the best in the area, I know they pay 95k$ minimum, and it's way easier to become architect or manager and get 110 / 120k or more 
17:38:25 <Yolteotl> (than in the same company in France)
17:41:02 <CockRoach|42> a manager sounds like a lot of trouble
