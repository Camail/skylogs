19:20:35 <DoT|Phone> what you do
19:20:47 <DuB`> Pig-liver-paste-eating onkel!
19:21:26 <skram> With PICKLES.
19:22:33 <DoT|Phone> what's the difference of pickles and gerkins
19:22:58 <DuB`> The difference is that I do not know what a gerkin is.
19:23:29 <DoT|Phone> D:
19:23:30 <DuB`> It seems that a gherking is a pickle.
19:23:32 <DuB`> Silly dot.
19:23:36 <DuB`> gherkin*
19:23:37 <skram> Gherkin is the language that Cucumber understands. It is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you describe software‚Äôs behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented.
19:23:51 <DuB`> No skram.
19:23:52 <DuB`> No.
19:24:32 <skram> Why no? That makes perfect sense to me.
