18:00:54 <Dot`> this whole EA debacle seems like its going to backfire, what people wanted was a removal of pay to win and outrages extra costs
18:01:09 <Dot`> what i keep seeing targeted is any form of reward system
18:06:34 <Zounds> I'm just hoping RNG progression somehow buggers off for good
18:06:57 <Camail> well, people are angry at lootcrates, and it makes sense
18:07:04 <Zounds> Even in Overwatch although it's just cosmetics it still irritates me a lot
18:07:35 <Camail> people are spending money and getting a small chance that they get something back, on the face of it there's really no distinction from gambling
18:08:39 <Camail> but there has been studies, referenced by james portnow during his desert bus interview, where they found that most "whales" aren't necessarily gambling addicts
18:09:08 <Camail> they are wealthy people who just...kinda want to spend a lot of money on it
18:09:16 <Camail> its a bit confusing and not entirely convincing tho
18:09:31 <Camail> honestly i just wish games would go to $75 as a base price
18:09:54 <Camail> games need to cost more for the consumer in general, we can't keep the $60 price tag anymore
18:13:11 <Dot`> its a genral problem all over, billing for a craft is hard
18:13:33 <Dot`> people are not willing to pay for not only the hours of work, or months even, but the years of experience behind it
18:21:25 <Golly> thats slightly bullshit camail, since they are focusing so much on big games instead of many, and save a ton on digital distribution
18:21:56 <Zounds> The manipulative gambling microtransactions shit on top of season passes and deluxe editions is just taking the piss
18:22:52 <Camail> Golly games haven't changed prices in over a decade, game creation has only increased in value
18:23:11 <Camail> they may save on distribution, but advertising and production costs FAR outweigh the savings
18:24:22 <Camail> in addition to the cost of creating high fidelity graphics being more expensive, we have the problem of inflation making games, at least, 25% more expensive to make
18:25:00 <Camail> that number alone covers anything they save by not making as many physical products
18:25:11 <Camail> which they still do make, so not all of those costs are gone

18:42:20 <Camail> golly there's two major issues i have with this perspective when it comes to this particular argument
18:42:38 <Camail> yes, i agree everything we see out of AAA studios is a money grab right now
18:43:00 <Camail> shadow of war, bf2, these games are trash because they are designed to take your money away and ti hurts the game
18:44:09 <Camail> but even this video shows, because they choose to focus more on a few games with the same adjusted company-wide budget, that games at the AAA level have become more expensive to make
18:44:51 <Camail> this video is making a conuter-point against the argument that games are too expensive to make for the companies that make them,  because before this they had a stable business model and chose to make more money
18:45:24 <Camail> but he never argues that companies could keep making games like this, a few releases every few years as opposed to many small releases, and still not change their business plan
18:46:14 <Camail> the big games have increased in price, after the change to being heavily focused on 1 or 2 AAA titles, could the company survive will keeping the old monetization plan while making a new production plan?
18:46:34 <Camail> there are no datapoints for that, we just know what they were making with the old method, and now what they make with the new method
18:47:16 <Golly> this is slightly above my level, but if they can get away with a higher price then im not stopping them

18:47:38 <Golly> im buying indie/sale/humble anyway
18:48:10 <Camail> thats the best thing, I'm ok with AAA price hikes because we aren't forced to only play big games anymore
18:48:33 <Camail> i havent bought a AAA game on release in years
18:48:37 <Golly> right
18:49:15 <Camail> but most people still do, a vast majority of sales are in the first month, to the point where they are fine selling something for 75% off a year later
