00:39:23 <DuB`> I'd love a golf gti hahaha
00:39:55 <skram> same
00:41:25 <skram> too bad they dont use the vr6 engine no mo
00:41:50 <DuB`> And then in 10 years after a few promotions I can get my nissan gtr and drive that forever and ever.

00:47:48 <Dot`> a bit of Q20 skram
00:47:49 <Dot`> sorted
00:48:24 <skram> is that some sort of knock-off WD40
00:48:44 <Dot`> knock off??? please, its the original
00:51:26 <DuB`> WD-40 was made for SPACE ROCKETS by NASA

00:53:44 <Dot`> q20 invented in South africa, supriour 
00:54:01 <DuB`> WUH

00:55:27 <skram> oh my sweet summer child
00:55:42 <skram> you know nothing about industrial lubrication products
00:55:48 <Dot`> the norwegion is just jelous
00:57:23 <skram> Actually all these products that does ALL OF THE THINGS are quite mediocre
00:57:40 <Dot`> thats pretty standard
00:57:53 <Dot`> thats why they ake specilised products skram
00:57:56 <Dot`> make*
00:58:04 <Dot`> to do things
00:58:09 <skram> quite so
00:58:10 <DuB`> Also 40 literally > 20, so...
00:58:36 <Dot`> dub, you lost that one already
00:58:40 <Dot`> minutes ago
00:58:42 <DuB`> ??
00:58:43 <skram> Thats why CRC 565 is the ultimate products
00:58:47 <DuB`> Hahaha
00:59:10 <DuB`> I shall invent ASDF 5000 and it'll be EVEN BETTER.
00:59:32 <skram> pls remember us lil people when ur a billionaire
00:59:55 <DuB`> No billionaire.
01:00:04 <DuB`> Not even gonna sell it, just be selfish and keep it to myself.
01:00:17 <skram> thats even worse!
01:00:33 <DuB`> But my things will be the best-lubricated and most rust-free things.
01:00:53 <Dot`> but how can you be true capatalist if you dont sell it
01:05:29 <Dot`> i shoud probably sleep

03:34:10 <Camail> what a terrible time for him
03:35:27 <DuB`> I already have enough games in my steam library that I haven't finished!
03:36:48 <Camail> what a terrible, dark, gruesome time
03:36:53 <Camail> even worse for his family, really
03:37:02 <Camail> they wanted to do something, but couldn't
03:47:34 <BioPhone> I cry every time
03:47:41 <DuB`> IRREDEEMABLE
03:47:47 <Camail> dub why is bio a phone
03:47:50 <Camail> SEE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
03:48:27 <Camail> we could be playing overwatch right now, but noooo
03:48:31 <Camail> you had to turn him into a phone
03:51:23 <DuB`> !?
03:51:31 <DuB`> Last time we played you guys left after 2 games anyway. :P
03:51:57 <Camail> thats 2 more games than i've played this year
03:52:17 <Camail> quite an increase
03:53:00 <DuB`> But two
03:53:04 <DuB`> Is a LITTLE number
03:53:09 <DuB`> Not very big
03:53:13 <Camail> fine
03:53:22 <Camail> play now
03:54:08 <DuB`> Am study~
03:54:20 <DuB`> Test this week on a topic I'm pretty behind on...
03:54:33 <Camail> see? i tried
03:54:36 <Camail> let the record show
03:54:41 <Camail> that dub didnt want to play overwatch
03:54:45 <DuB`> You did.
03:54:47 <Camail> and cam did, and was denied
03:54:53 <DuB`> I do though!
03:54:55 <DuB`> Just...
03:54:55 <DuB`> oi
03:55:12 <Camail> and he was burned so harshly by said denial, that he was justified to never play again
03:55:24 <DuB`> Oh dear
03:55:35 <Camail> really I'm just trying to get that sweet pro money before the bubble bursts
03:56:34 <DuB`> Pah
03:56:49 <DuB`> OWL means that only a fraction of pros even have a team or games to play in anymore anyway
03:57:32 <Camail> yup!, doesnt stop rando companies from putting 10s of millions into a local team that has no community built up yet
03:58:16 <DuB`> ... yeah.
03:59:22 <DuB`> Also I haven't seen a great explanation for each team signing like 10+ players
03:59:34 <Camail> wait for real???
03:59:37 <DuB`> Practice partner B team? Sounds yuck
03:59:41 <Camail> these fuckers have 2nd strings?
03:59:43 <Camail> ahahaha
04:00:13 <Camail> the entire esports world doesnt have the depth for a 2nd string
04:00:42 <Camail> well blizzard is making TONS OF MONEY
04:00:53 <Camail> which is fine, hopefully it goes into making another good game?
04:01:09 <Camail> like diablo 4, which is just two copies of diablo 2
04:01:38 <Camail> or maybe dub...maybe this is to fund the OW single player campaign
04:02:44 <DuB`> Meh
04:03:03 <Camail> it'd be cool
04:06:41 <DuB`> I just wanna sit on the payload and shoot everything in sight as Ana, man
04:07:28 <Camail> that sounds awful
04:07:45 <Camail> my hand hurts just thinking about it
04:57:35 <Camail> PATCH IS OUT WOOO
05:09:27 <DuB`> Hadn't seen/heard this game before: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jigRSeRYMzA
05:09:32 <DuB`> Very nice :O
05:27:59 <Camail> woo, did it
05:28:21 <Camail> took longer than it should've but i got the last bit really quick
05:28:39 <Camail> i bit under 30 minutes for my 3rd full attempt
05:53:23 <Camail> hmm... not sure what my reward does
05:53:27 <Camail> it doesn't change the ending
06:01:06 <Camail> maybe the final content patch is gonna deal with it? who knows
06:01:19 <Camail> was hoping for something more substantial but it was worth it
06:01:30 <Camail> at least worth doing once, 3 times was kind of annoying

19:39:02 <Dot`> its embarrasing how bad i am 
19:39:19 <Camail> you cant be embarrassed in a single player game dot
19:39:22 <Camail> thats unpossible
19:41:50 <Camail> i still dont recal which boss the first one is
19:42:53 <Dot`> i was trying to look for name
19:42:56 <Dot`> Revek
19:43:08 <Dot`> like the litral first spirit
19:43:12 <Camail> oh
19:43:15 <Camail> i didnt even do that one
19:45:20 <Dot`> she attacks you any time you use a dream nail on another ghost
19:46:31 <Camail> yea, there isn't really a reward for it so i never tried
19:46:48 <Camail> also i killed all the ghosts in there long before he was implemented
19:47:26 <Camail> the crystal guy can kinda just be brute forced if you have a high level nail and a lot of health
19:47:45 <Camail> there's also better bosses you aren't doing that are way more fun
19:48:15 <Dot`> but i need spirit
19:48:24 <Dot`> and i thought killing those would get me spirit
19:48:28 <Dot`> its a spirit glade
19:50:13 <Camail> only like 10
19:50:20 <Camail> its not worth it and not necessary
19:50:54 <Camail> you get all the essence you need from dream bosses and the ghosts at tombs
19:51:01 <Camail> revek is an after thought
19:52:32 <Dot`> hmm, i must be missing sometihng, i only have bouncy ghost in the deep left to kill and have 990 spirit only
