20:25:19 <skram> good

20:29:56 <skram> He is pretty awesome
20:30:21 <Zounds> Yeah he's cool, I like him a lot better when I changed my build a bit
20:30:57 <Zounds> I'll play whoever I think will be useful dot :P
20:31:04 <Zounds> Though I enjoy Pakko and Voden the most so far
20:31:13 <Zounds> And Wu is pretty baller
20:32:13 <skram> I thought Voden was kind of boring honestly
20:32:46 <Zounds> Did you take the talents that means when he poisons someone it spreads in AoE?
20:32:56 <skram> did not try that
20:33:03 <Zounds> It's fun and satisfying
