22:45:34 <Runbunny> also.
22:45:43 <Runbunny> Shh no tears. Only dreams now.
22:47:02 <Camail> the first time i heard that was during the infamous destiny and itmejp h1z1 stream and all of a sudden after that i heard it everywhere
22:47:11 <Camail> is there another reference?
22:47:21 <Crisium> Micen|droid ready when you are, or will be when i get a link
22:47:23 <Camail> is it 4chan meme?
22:47:44 <Camail> oh no it wasnt jp at all
22:47:57 <DuB`> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa what a video hahaha
22:49:18 <Runbunny> I thought it was the rustle jimmy gorilla thing, if you are in fact refering to what I said.
22:49:50 <Runbunny> also this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygr5AHufBN4
22:50:39 <Camail> destiny predates that
22:50:49 <Camail> but he's a piece of shit so he probably visits 4chan
22:51:09 <Camail> i can only assume its a 4chan meme that he used, then it exploded around the same time
22:51:15 <Runbunny> I guess.
22:51:33 <Runbunny> anyhoo
22:51:34 <Runbunny> http://i.imgur.com/3u5kLx9.png
22:51:37 <Runbunny> It's time to sleep.
22:51:43 <Camail> gay
22:51:46 <skram> good night anders
22:51:53 <Dot`> gnight
22:52:17 <DuB`> Aw, I just got here!
22:52:29 <DuB`> Oh that was for ranban
22:52:31 <DuB`> Not dot
22:52:42 <Crisium> dot will  never sleep
22:52:49 <DuB`> Uh oh
22:53:43 <Dot`> i almost went to sleep 2 hours ago
22:53:44 <skram> dot is a big boi and he does what he wants
22:53:48 <Dot`> but then i  started waking up
22:55:52 <skram> having a bird that talks seems very exhausting judging by these talky bird video compilation things
22:56:47 <Dot`> birds are viciuos dumb creatures
22:56:52 <Dot`> the larger tlaking kinds at least
22:57:32 <skram> unless its a duck
22:57:33 <skram> they're great
22:57:46 <Dot`> yes
22:57:53 <Dot`> but they do make a mess
22:58:04 <skram> true
22:58:08 <skram> wouldnt want one indoors
22:58:53 <Camail> the smarter the animal the more work it takes
22:59:21 <Camail> which is why people like cats
22:59:48 <skram> eh, cats are clever but they give 0 shits about you
22:59:53 <skram> well sorty of
22:59:55 <Camail> also Dot`  today amrks the day that youtube has every single CR episode, as the video became listed a few hours ago
23:00:27 <Camail> all animals are clever because they're specialized
23:15:43 <Camail> man the ending to critical role is still so emotional
23:16:27 <Camail> the actual content was meh as an epilogue but i think that was because everyone was really taken off their game by how emotional it got
23:17:46 <Micen|droid> Sorry crisium. Give me one sec
23:19:35 <Micen|droid> Cytu
23:19:48 <Micen|droid> Cytu.be/r/micen
