02:50:35 <ZK> ooooh pinepapple pizza
02:50:36 <ZK> good
03:07:31 <ZK> heh actually calculated xp, would have been about 600 per char, but we'll level up anyways :P
03:09:40 <DuB`> How much for lv2 normallY?
03:10:36 <ZK> 1000
03:10:46 <ZK> lvl 2 is more fun as a character, so im happier this way
03:12:18 <DuB`> Huh.
03:12:27 <DuB`> So normally you REALLY have to get murdering things.
03:12:31 <DuB`> Waow.
03:14:30 <ZK> or probly just stronger things
03:14:36 <ZK> we only murdered a lot of smaller things
03:14:58 <ZK> say like, one dragon would bring you to level 3
03:15:22 <ZK> 4th level*
03:15:25 <ZK> oh waitttt no
03:15:29 <ZK> lol, im in the wrong edition
03:15:33 <ZK> its 300 xp to level 2
03:15:36 <ZK> so we were gooood
03:16:00 <DuB`> LOL!
03:16:03 <ZK> so yea, beat double whats necessary to get to level 2
03:16:12 <DuB`> Bahahaha
03:16:17 <ZK> that makes more sense
03:16:27 <ZK> but still killing one dragon would get you to level 4!
03:16:37 <DuB`> I should have had channel divinity BEFORE we even did the seige fight. :P
03:16:53 <ZK> yea, probly
03:16:56 <DuB`> Then I can do aoe lucio heals.
03:16:57 <DuB`> Weee
03:17:03 <DuB`> Can't go fast, though. :T
03:18:39 <ZK> after short rest, not bad
03:21:12 <ZK> so now you cam and dot want short rests a lot
03:21:27 <DuB`> Every ten minutes: BREAK TIME
03:21:51 <DuB`> Need our naps.l
03:21:55 <DuB`> -l

08:09:41 <Rawr|Fone> How are you today yolt
08:13:21 <Yolteotl> a bit confused :D did not sleep well, cloudy weather outside, cold temperature, girl not in town this week end 
08:13:34 <Yolteotl> I'd like to be monday yet :D:D
08:13:53 <Micen> go take a drive, clear you head.
08:14:26 <Yolteotl> I'm about to jog
08:14:27 <Yolteotl> <3
08:15:32 <Yolteotl> Hi Micen!
08:16:01 <Micen> Hi Yolt
08:17:42 <Yolteotl> girl tried VR yesterday, first thing she did in Job simulator was to draw dick pic with paint 
08:18:11 <Micen> sounds like a winner. first thing i did was lay in bed and watch netflix
08:18:23 <Yolteotl> ahaha
08:18:24 <Yolteotl> silly
08:18:36 <Micen> but then again i have one of those Gear VR headsets for the phone and not a PC hookup vr
08:18:57 <Yolteotl> mine is playstaiton vr
08:19:05 <Yolteotl> so, less good than pc vr
08:19:36 <Micen> ahh, yeah, mine is just a glorified holster and gyroscope for my phone. 
08:19:46 <Yolteotl> ahah
08:19:55 <Micen> But you a step above me. 
08:20:29 <Yolteotl> I may not move to USA as soon as I said last time
08:20:36 <Micen> I wonder how long until we have SAO or .hack levels of VR
08:20:55 <Micen> Thats what I want. true, full escapism.
08:21:25 <Yolteotl> hmm, when you will be ok to have a USB 5.0 port at the back of your neck ? :D 
08:21:43 <Micen> Any time. 
08:22:21 <Yolteotl> hehe
08:22:40 <Micen> I think it was sony that was looking at some kind of sensor you just place on the back of your neck that reads the electric impulses going down your spine
08:23:17 <Micen> so it would be more like a line for an exo-spine rather than a literal plugging in. 
08:23:32 <Yolteotl> Alphago will kill us before this kind of technology may be ready
08:23:53 <Yolteotl> first go, then starcraft, then world.
08:25:04 <Yolteotl> I come back later ;) 
08:25:14 <Micen> making my ui look nice in wow is hard
08:25:59 <Micen> bye yolt. have good run

08:49:07 <Lynda> hi
08:50:37 <CockRoach|42> hai
08:53:31 <Lynda> anyone started playing BW again in anticipation of SC: Remastered?
08:56:25 <CockRoach|42> i believe so, but cant remember who
08:58:47 <Micen> ive been starting to read strats and watch all the BW content being put out  but havent started playing again yet
09:00:16 <Lynda> I can't wait for the ladder functionality because my predisposition to carpal tunnels made me not want to play on iCCup for years due to the too rough competition there even at D- rank, and without a ladder otherwise it's bleh
09:02:56 <CockRoach|42> Micen: dont forget to watch this match: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dqYxpxegrk
09:03:02 <CockRoach|42> the most important one :)
09:05:08 <Micen> combat-ed!
09:05:16 <Micen> combat-ex, even
09:05:50 <Lynda> I hate dash combat dash ex dash because he kept me away from Teamliquid for a long time when I first got interested in competitive BW
09:06:07 <Lynda> I found his videos first, and he kept badmouthing Teamliquid in many of his videos
09:06:40 <Lynda> and I got the impression that Teamliquid was way too extremely pretentious and elitistic
09:07:00 <CockRoach|42> :/
09:07:22 <Micen> well its intimidating. At least it was for me. 
09:07:26 <Lynda> Day9 commentating that match was what got me interested in checking out other content from Day9 and then from Teamliquid
09:07:48 <CockRoach|42> \o/
09:08:09 <Micen> I hear Day9 is calling a tourney soon.
09:08:27 <CockRoach|42> oooh
09:09:12 <Lynda> anyway I was really surprised to hear years later that Scarlett publicly thanked combat-ex for helping her practice for a tournament
09:11:40 <CockRoach|42> that was unexpected
09:19:33 <Lynda> if anyone will be up for some BW matches, let me know on Discord
10:02:17 <Yolteotl> SC: Remastered killed the last part of myself wanting to play Sc2 :P :( 
10:14:34 <CockRoach|42> pls yolt
10:19:08 <Yolteotl> That's true, I'm happy for BW fans, but I did not launch SC2 since the announcement ;) 
10:23:24 <CockRoach|42> is it because of the announcement or because you're lazy? :)
10:24:07 <Yolteotl> since I was the last here to play Sc2 ::P
10:24:10 <Micen> I havent launched sc2 since LotV came out
10:24:44 <Micen> I would have been playing, i just dont have the last game. and now there isnt a reason to. 
10:26:04 <CockRoach|42> sgdq is begins tomorrow!
10:26:08 <CockRoach|42> -is
10:26:27 <Micen> Anyone we know in it?
10:28:09 <CockRoach|42> not that i know of... nuclear is probably roaming behind the scenes, as usual
10:32:59 <Micen> I will say, until you pointed that out last time they were in here, I never noticed Raels name was Nuclear backwards. 
10:34:19 <CockRoach|42> bad hors :|
10:34:19 <Lynda> there are many people on Teamliquid with backwards names: Grobyc, rekrul, etc.
10:34:59 <Lynda> I like the fact that BW just always makes games feel like they were very exciting and fun and intense even when losing. SC2 and dota just failed to give me that feeling for many years
10:35:48 <CockRoach|42> i havent watched sc2 in ages ._.
10:36:30 <Lynda> just held off a Terran push with a superior army because I just got Consume researched and got off some sick Dark Swarms. I still lost, but it was so fun
10:40:19 <Lynda> also playing BW really makes one appreciate BW progamers' skills that much more
10:41:11 <Micen> my sister refuses to watch Korean BW play. It makes her feel bad how lacking she is and just how slow she really is
10:41:25 <CockRoach|42> haha
10:41:38 <Micen> She also wont play me 1v1. :(
10:41:42 <CockRoach|42> :O
10:41:47 <CockRoach|42> become GM!
10:42:24 <Micen> because she knows that i have enough knowledge from watching to be able to out strategy her into the ground. 
10:42:40 <Micen> Also, she refuses to make any comp but Ling/Hydra. 
10:42:50 <Micen> She doesn't even get lurkers!
10:43:05 <CockRoach|42> what a scrub!
10:47:37 <Micen> There we go, sent it to her
10:47:45 <Micen> took a screenshot of chat.

14:00:40 <Dot`> these thigns happen runbun
14:01:19 <ZK> "Rape just happens" -DoT. I'm preparing notes for DnD
14:02:18 <Runbunny> Dot Dot.
14:02:19 <ZK> gotta knock you unconscious again
14:03:21 <ZK> 90 minute game of thrones episode
14:03:23 <ZK> that should be fun
14:03:39 <ZK> tv show episode longer than some movies, not bad
14:03:52 <Lynda> I'm finding my main problem in BW is getting contained early and by the time I can push out, my opponent expanded and I am way too behind on economy
14:04:42 <Dot`> hey lyn
14:05:04 <ZK> oooh, i should try BW again.
14:05:25 <ZK> Which race you play lynda?
14:05:37 <Lynda> Random
14:05:44 <Lynda> though Zerg is arguably my best
14:05:51 <Lynda> except ZvZ
14:05:57 <Runbunny> I think you can push out earlier if the opponent is expanding a lot.
14:06:19 <Runbunny> Dot I am greatly in need of your expertise.
14:06:21 <Lynda> I just lost a TvT because the opponent had superior Tank positioning and also got some Goliaths before I brought out a Wraith and a Dropship
14:06:34 <Lynda> and then he just outmacro'd me due to superior econ
14:06:46 <ZK> TvT seems hard
14:07:00 <Lynda> like not superior Tank positioning but he had his Barracks over my cliff so I couldn't siege on the high ground against his Tanks on the low ground
14:07:06 <Runbunny> TvT is like chess, you make one wrong move and everything goes to shit.
14:07:17 <Lynda> late-game TvT is pretty epic though
14:07:28 <Lynda> requiring mass Wraiths or BCs or Nukes to break Tank lines
14:08:02 <Lynda> up for some BW games later today ZK?
14:08:40 <Lynda> I've been watching a lot of Sean's BW dailies
14:08:50 <Lynda> he offers so much excellent insight
14:08:52 <Lynda> (well duh)
14:08:57 <ZK> Sure, havent played in forever nor have i ever really played, so should be fun
14:13:00 <Lynda> also I got back into watching BW VODs and now they seem even more entertaining than longer ago somehow
14:13:09 <Lynda> I guess it's due to the fact that I'm hyped for matchmaking
14:13:55 <ZK> matchmaking will be pretty hype
14:14:34 <Runbunny> Dot` fix steam please :/

19:32:19 <ZK> you know what happens in each ep? Dannng
19:32:47 <ZK> ok, i want to try critical role again, but last time i started at ep 1, i didnt finish it, is there a good place to start to get hooked?
19:33:22 <Micen> umm... yeah
19:33:50 <ZK> could you tell me where it is? :P
19:33:52 <Micen> theres a few spots. 
19:33:57 <Micen> im looking 
19:34:15 <Micen> do you want still low level stuff, or the best spot to start thats close to live?
19:34:39 <ZK> either or
19:34:48 <ZK> if i enjoy it, i'll probly go back, if i dont, well, i dont
19:37:36 <Micen> http://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-episode-85-a-bards-lament/
19:38:26 <Micen> thats the start of the transition between the last big arc and the one we are currently in. 
19:38:39 <ZK> kk sounds good
19:42:22 <ZK> ok lets try this
19:50:59 <ZK> says story arc starts at 84 though?
19:51:06 <ZK> on wikipedia anyhow
19:54:14 <carcinisation> can't trust wikipedia, anyone could edit it. even you!
19:55:12 <Micen> yeah watch 84. its technically the end of the previous arc, but its still a great episode. and it has a boss fight. 
19:55:43 <Micen> wait no. 
19:55:58 <Micen> this is odd i was geting my episodes backwards. the crit role wiki is bad
19:56:03 <Micen> start at 84. 
20:28:18 <ZK> people are crying, but not invested enough yet to feel it :(
20:37:37 <DoT`> i dont know about starting so far into it
20:37:55 <DoT`> but it depends i guess on how much time you have to invest in it
20:41:19 <ZK> yeaaaaaaaa, i probly dont have 300 hours
20:41:36 <ZK> unless i really like it, i wont watch 103 episodes so a primer like this is better
20:41:59 <ZK> might have the podcast while im driving or somethin

22:28:56 <DuB`> They don't even have ice in nashville.
22:31:24 <DoT`> how they cool thier drinks?
22:31:55 <ZK> fridge
22:32:13 <ZK> its a big box that makes inside it cold
22:32:28 <ZK> works through black magic
22:33:23 <ZK> i think from now on, instead of looking for characters names with name generators, im just going to take them all from the bible
22:33:35 <DoT`> haha
22:33:53 <BioPon> Remove nashville
22:35:13 <ZK> hey maybe they'll lose a defenseman, you know, like trade ekholm for duchene. Wouldnt that be great?
