20:17:17 <Camail> i know its bad to take 1v1's in a xv1 scenario but he had a really good position
20:21:24 <Camail> they almost dropped that trophy 3 times

21:31:27 <Camail> also its a game for 2-4, i played it with 3, and you dont always have to have the same people
21:31:39 <Camail> but the game is persistent regardless of who is playing
21:32:54 <Camail> thne its up to us if we want to play a warm up game of the normal pandemic before we play legacy
