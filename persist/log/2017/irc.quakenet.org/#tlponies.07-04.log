00:27:52 <ZK> oh mirrors edge

00:37:22 <ZK> ok, so DnD Wednesday 12 EST good?
00:37:56 <Camail> well i dont know to whatr extent it is glitchless but the two major glitches it avoids seem to be kick glitch and out of bounds glitches
00:38:17 <Camail> sounds good zk
00:39:01 <Camail> kick glitch is a mid air kick done in such a way that an invisible platform is created and faith gets mid air jump
00:39:18 <Camail> oob stuff is mostly clipping oob then jumping into the loading zone
