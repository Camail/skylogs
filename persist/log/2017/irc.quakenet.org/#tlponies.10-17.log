23:29:52 <Bio> rip
23:30:10 <DoT_> learn to pirate pls Bio
23:30:19 <Bio> i'm the worst dto
23:30:50 <Camail> i can give you the torrent file that i used, i tried before but you didnt take it
23:31:17 <Bio> i already dl'd it from skidrow-games
23:31:32 <Bio> thats the same one yeh?
23:31:47 <Camail> oh bio did you follow the instructions
23:31:57 <Camail> add a firewall blocking the exe
23:32:13 <Camail> put the crack in the game folder
23:32:18 <Camail> those are the two things you need to do
23:34:50 <Bio> remind me how 2 firewal
23:35:35 <Camail> ok
23:35:47 <Camail> go to "windows firewall with advacned security"
23:35:56 <Camail> spelled correctly tho
23:36:14 <Bio> kay
23:36:19 <Camail> in the first column on the left there is an option for outbound rules
23:36:24 <Camail> click that to display your rules
23:36:31 <Bio> kay
23:36:37 <Camail> on the farthest right column there is a create rule... option
23:36:42 <Camail> new*
23:36:50 <Camail> click program, next
23:36:52 <Bio> kay
23:36:57 <Camail> this program path:
23:37:00 <Camail> go to the .exe
23:37:07 <Camail> use the path to the game's .exe there
23:37:26 <Bio> k
23:37:30 <Camail> then choose block the connection
23:37:37 <Camail> then all three, domain private and public
23:37:49 <Camail> name it something you will remember once you read it
23:37:54 <Bio> k
23:37:55 <Camail> such as "[name] blocker"
23:37:57 <Camail> and thats that
23:38:00 <Camail> hit finish
23:38:10 <Camail> there should be a new rule with a giant circle crossed out
23:38:35 <Bio> yup
23:38:41 <Camail> thats it for the firewall
23:38:49 <Camail> thne you have to have the crack folder in the game folder
23:39:06 <Camail> i always click the option during instal on the codex client that does it automatically
23:39:12 <Camail> so i cant remember exactly what to do there
23:39:15 <Camail> but its google-able
23:39:32 <DoT_> normaly just a copy paste
23:39:45 <Camail> yea but which folders and where exactly to put them i cant recal
23:39:49 <Camail> it is just a copy and paste tho
23:40:45 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNsTZH8QepU
23:41:06 <Camail> i dunno if thats a generalized rule
23:41:16 <Camail> but it should look very similar to what this guy does
23:41:21 <Bio> there we go
23:42:16 <Camail> yay!
23:42:40 <Camail> enjoy your uruk romance game
23:42:52 <Bio> yar har and such
23:42:53 <Camail> i made so many orcs kiss
23:43:10 <DuB`> katawa sauron
23:43:30 <Camail> i accidentally dominated like 5 captains in a span of 10 minutes because they all kept ambushing me and had easily exploitable weaknesses
23:43:35 <Camail> dub go sit in a corner
23:43:39 <Camail> you were here the entire time
23:43:40 <Camail> lsitening
23:43:48 <DuB`> Ye
23:43:56 <Camail> and you deemed that comment an appropriate time to jump in
23:44:01 <Camail> how dare you
23:44:14 <Camail> dot, tell dub to be ashamed
23:44:20 <DuB`> Well commenting on file installation is far less interesting.
23:44:21 <DuB`> I thought.
23:44:50 <Camail> IF YOU DONT LOVE ME AT MY WORST YOU DONT DESERVE ME AT MY BEST
23:45:41 <DuB`> i luv u alway
23:46:12 <DoT_> Duuub
23:46:19 <DuB`> doot doot
23:47:15 <DoT_> giant robot fight tonight dub

23:49:31 <DoT_> i have to sleep before that
23:50:07 <DoT_> oh and cam, i now dont work on fridays so if Crit roll was still on i could have stayed up 
23:50:13 <DoT_> but they went and stopped
23:50:23 <Camail> rip
23:50:35 <Camail> well they still have a show with them
23:50:59 <Camail> its just that the next campaign wont be fore 2.5 months
23:51:09 <DoT_> THATS SO LONG
23:51:15 <Camail> matt deserves to have a life, tho
23:51:21 <Camail> he hasnt had one for years
23:51:40 <DoT_> no ones saying they dont deserve it
23:51:49 <DoT_> but can still be unhappy for no games
23:52:30 <DuB`> We can compromise
23:52:40 <DuB`> He can have ONE month of life then gib dnd
23:54:54 <Camail> also they are getting married in like 3 days so he woont be around until november
23:55:03 <Camail> but then we might even see him as a player for a bit!
23:55:14 <DuB`> oho
23:55:38 <DoT_> ive only seen him as a player once and it was in a weird system
23:55:41 <DoT_> was good though
