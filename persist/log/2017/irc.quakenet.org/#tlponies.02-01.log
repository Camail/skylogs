00:33:43 <motbob> youtube has been steadily increasing their video length limit
00:34:02 <motbob> for example, it used to be 10 hours a few years ago. Now it's 12 hours.
00:34:22 <motbob> Once it increases again, I can make a video of mario building up speed for over twelve hours
00:34:23 <ZK> didnt it used to be 10 minutes or so?
00:39:40 <Micen|Droid_> When they had the old producer system in place if you signed up you could do 24 hours. 
00:40:19 <Micen|Droid_> And those accounts were grandfathered in. 
00:41:30 <Runbunny> I was wondering my stick wasn't working, it turns out it actually wasn't plugged in :/
