00:18:34 <Dot`> hows you
00:18:52 <Bio> ok
00:20:11 <motbob> https://i.gyazo.com/734a80a7a10c89fe23cc94dfe491d100.png
00:20:43 <Dot`> haha
00:23:27 <Micen> yeah. Cant wait to get it all listed up and get money coming in. Then I might try and flip a box of the new magic set with the funds. 
00:23:52 <Dot`> cunning
00:23:58 <Micen> It wont be a 3000% return like that find, but it will start more growth.
00:25:16 <motbob> i passed the lawyer ethics exam
00:25:22 <motbob> i got below the median
00:25:52 <Micen> Does that mean you are slightly more unethical than the average lawyer?
00:26:08 <motbob> that's not saying much, but I suppose you're right
00:26:25 <motbob> lawyers care a *lot* about rules
00:26:29 <Dot`> gj passing mot, maybe you where TOO ethical to be a lawyer
00:26:32 <motbob> and there are a *lot* of ethical rules
00:26:52 <motbob> which means that if something falls outside the rules, most lawyers will celebrate and take the opportunity to be unethical
00:27:04 <Micen> Its k mot, I trust you. 
00:27:10 <Micen> What kind of law are you going into? 
00:27:37 <motbob> it looks most likely to be personal injury work
00:27:40 <Dot`> the slightly less than average ethical law
00:29:05 <Micen> You already start working on your terribly cringy slogan and catchy name. 
00:30:02 <Micen> We have a local injury lawyer who is fat and for years he advertised as "The Heavy Hitter." You need something like that to get people to remember you. 
00:31:12 <motbob> i'd be part of a firm, which has its own brand, so i'll be OK
00:32:23 <Micen> Just jump out on your own
00:32:35 <Micen> explode onto the scene mot. 
00:32:39 <Micen> take the world by storm
00:55:37 <Runbunny> alright, I think I am done.
01:05:02 <reification> night all
01:05:51 <Dot`> gnight reif
01:06:40 <Camail> oh motbob should replace his hands with live bees, it's easy to remember the lawyer with bee hands
01:06:45 <Camail> never have to pay for marketing

11:16:22 <motbob> yesterday I had a poop. normally this would not be noteworthy.
11:16:57 <motbob> But when I looked in the toilet bowl, the stool was nowhere to be found. This never happens in my toilet. For some reason this broke my brain.
11:17:28 <motbob> For the following hour I had a paranoid fear that the stool had gotten stuck to my buttocks or leg or something

11:37:41 <Dot`> you pick one of those
11:37:42 <reification> just says favoured enemies in 5 mile range as far as i can see
11:38:04 <reification> no you can pick 2x humanoid subtypes
11:38:09 <reification> for orig 5e
11:38:17 <reification> i went drow/orc
11:38:21 <Dot`> Primeveil awareness
11:38:27 <Dot`> not favoured enemy
11:38:40 <Dot`> you get it at 3rd level
11:38:51 <reification> yes that is what i am reading dot
11:41:08 <Dot`> my PHB pdf looks like this http://i.imgur.com/A8QZGvW.png

11:42:33 <reification> just the one you sent me
11:42:49 <reification> Unearthed Arcana: The Ranger, Revised
11:44:20 <Dot`> ok, thats what i thought originaly you where using, bu tthen you said PHB last time we talked
11:45:41 <Dot`> but then favoured enemy you have the PHB version
11:46:49 <reification> this has all been less a considered decision and more cluelessness dot
11:47:04 <Dot`> its no real problem
11:48:02 <Dot`> you dont seem to have used any of the revised stuff and as far as hunter archtype goes there is no diffrence i think between the 2
11:48:43 <Dot`> nope, no diffrence

12:01:37 <Dot`> so the 3 main diffrences of the 2 rangers is 1) revised has no favoured terrain its abilities work for ALL terrain. 2) you have advantage on initiiative rolls 3)your favoured enemy choice can be humanoid instead of 2 subtypes of humanoid
