00:20:46 <DuB`> Horseman :o
00:21:35 <DuB`> YEY
00:22:13 <DuB`> 7-0 on necro
00:22:20 <skram> pretty good
00:22:21 <Bio> huskar
00:22:25 <Bio> or troll
00:22:30 <skram> yeah
00:22:42 <Bio> troll is probably better
00:22:49 <DuB`> PA! :D
00:22:55 <Bio> wards plus centaur is pretty good vs huskar
00:23:09 <skram> whAT ABOUT BROODMOM
00:23:17 <Bio> it could be
00:23:19 <skram> ooh
00:23:20 <skram> yunero
00:23:24 <Bio> JUGGR
00:23:37 <Bio> more sustain for push
00:23:47 <DuB`> First time liquid play this?
00:23:50 <DuB`> On mainstage, at least.
00:23:56 <Bio> think so
00:24:06 <carcinisation> is there some indication if they let time reserve time elapse?
00:24:08 <skram> Not seen yunero at all so far actually
00:24:21 <carcinisation> and has it happened in tourney?
00:24:39 <Bio> if reserve time runs out and there isn't a pick/ban, its random
00:24:43 <motbob> miracle doesn't have his choice of heroes for once
00:24:47 <Bio> and I don't think its happened
00:24:48 <skram> probably not reif
00:24:54 <motbob> let's see how that affects him
00:24:59 <skram> it did happen in the allstar match
00:25:02 <skram> in banning phase
00:25:06 <Bio> oh did it
00:25:18 <skram> yass
00:25:23 <Rawr|Fone> Newbee randomed alch against og
00:25:26 <Rawr|Fone> They lost
00:25:26 <carcinisation> i understand bio, the question is how we tell a lucky random vs last millisecond pick
00:25:45 <skram> I dont think there is reif
00:25:47 <Bio> i think in the client it will say random
00:25:54 <Bio> could be wrong
00:26:03 <Rawr|Fone> If the time is at 0 it is random
00:26:28 <motbob> where's the carry????
00:26:33 <Rawr|Fone> If it's a pick it will be 00.01
00:26:44 <motbob> butterfly veno let's go
00:26:44 <skram> I remember when windrunner was META
00:26:48 <skram> those were better times
00:26:52 <carcinisation> ok ty rawr <3
00:27:07 <Bio> shackle too hard, better to take ez stuns
00:27:10 <Bio> =3
00:27:29 <skram> shackle is a ez stun bio
00:27:32 <skram> just ask LoH
00:27:45 <Bio> i did, he told me to get off his lawn
00:28:06 <skram> in russian?
00:28:17 <Bio> it was like half and half

00:28:31 <skram> cyka blyat comrade bio, davai off my lawn
00:28:46 <skram> miracle
00:28:47 <skram> nej
00:29:25 <Bio> the conflict

00:44:07 <skram> veno is getting fat tho
00:44:08 <Bio> es blink close
00:45:11 <Bio> i'm less worried about a fat veno 
00:45:30 <Rawr|Fone> Looking like a 3-0
00:45:38 <Bio> the later this game goes the better for liquid i think
00:45:41 <motbob> this game is so fucking over
00:45:47 <Bio> also this^
00:46:46 <DuB`> Wall seems so meh
00:47:02 <Bio> it is, newbee don't really have any good rightclickers
00:47:29 <skram> Wall is really scary when there are dudes who do damages
00:47:31 <Bio> veno illusion and cent illusion probably best, but illusions are really weak right now
00:48:05 <skram> sometimes its very useful as a zoning tool too
00:51:35 <DuB`> Tower Offense
00:52:18 <motbob> what does diffusal purge here
00:52:48 <skram> surge
00:55:17 <motbob> ya but dark seer is on jugg's team 
00:55:34 <Bio> maybe its just for the slow
00:55:42 <skram> rampage
00:55:44 <skram> is what i mean
00:56:01 <Rawr|Fone> Euls, atos(?), silence

01:03:15 <motbob> newbee still don't have a carry
01:05:51 <Rawr|Fone> Liquid should be able to get the next aegis
01:06:20 <DuB`> DUNKS

18:50:44 <Zounds> I met a lot of canadians
18:51:04 <reification> that bad eh?
18:51:37 <Zounds> Lots of canadians have scottish ancestry
18:52:22 <Zounds> There's even a province called nova scotia ofc
