02:53:20 <Camail> he might have more legendary resists tho
02:53:30 <Camail> traditionally they have 3 but maybe 4 or even 5
02:54:12 <Camail> also guys matt didnt say it
02:54:18 <Camail> but right now vax's eyes are glowing
02:54:24 <Camail> because he's near his target
02:54:31 <Camail> i hope matt mentions it
02:55:43 <Camail> but really if they can save 8th or 9th level spells until after the legendary resists are burned this fight might be over?

03:09:42 <Camail> but the way matt thought about it i doubt it
03:09:52 <Micen|droid> Travis is great. 
03:09:56 <Camail> he hesitated using it, like it was a bigger decision than the other two
03:10:06 <Micen|droid> Thats true
03:10:22 <Camail> and i HOPE he doesnt have another one
03:10:23 <Micen|droid> You know. This might be the end. But I am okay with this
03:10:48 <Camail> well, okay with what, VM being done in general or them dying and the world ending
03:11:10 <Camail> I'm fine with vm being done but i have a minor emotional investment in the entire world
03:11:16 <Micen|droid> Vm being done
03:11:54 <Camail> it needed to be done
03:12:04 <Camail> this is where campaigns end, by fighting a god, there's nothing left to do
