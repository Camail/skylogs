09:13:57 * Micen is excite -.-
09:14:23 <Micen> I get to spend all morning reading state and federal labor law for my sister because her work is super shady. 
09:14:56 <DoT_> gl micen
09:42:52 <DoT_> Rawr rawr rawr
09:46:31 <Cane> DoT_, didn't have time to climb, otherwise obviously I'm a GM quality player. You can tell by how I still think Scattershot is a broken ability that should be removed from the game.
09:47:41 <DoT_> you should have clearly been placed directly into GM with your game knowledge
09:48:01 <DoT_> back in 10 minutes, need to find a particuler bus
09:48:55 <Micen> Dots finding the bus to GM land
10:15:02 <motbob> my law school professor was arrested for stalking
10:15:17 <motbob> i found out because I got an email saying thursday's class is cancelled
10:16:14 <Micen> this good or bad?
10:18:25 <Phearlock> Sounds like it is on the bad spectrum
10:18:28 <motbob> what a complicated question

10:18:57 <motbob> it's bad in the sense that either (1) he stalked someone in the past or (2) he was unjustly arrested
10:19:12 <motbob> it's bad because it creates unpredictability for me in this class
10:19:23 <motbob> it's go7099809.15

21:18:40 <motbob> 40 light years is a long way
21:18:56 <motbob> it would take a probe 40 years to tell us what's there...
21:19:11 <motbob> ...after it got to the system
21:19:39 <motbob> the problem with sending a probe that far is that you run into the Ender's Game problem
21:20:02 <motbob> where space travel tech improves after you launch the first ships and so the later ships arrive first
21:20:14 <reimeuk> how fast could we send a probe with current tech?
21:20:15 <motbob> so in the end you would have been better off just waiting to send a probe at all
21:21:25 <motbob> the newest advances in long-distance space travel are basically untested iirc
21:21:41 <motbob> so i don't know the answer to that and I don't know if anyone knows
