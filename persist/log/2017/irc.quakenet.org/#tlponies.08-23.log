21:11:58 <BioPhone> They did a reaction vid on a dude, dude got butthurt and filed dmca
21:12:13 <Camail> who was suing them, again?
21:12:19 <BioPhone> Then they filed counter, then lawsuit
21:12:31 <CockRoach|42> http://time.com/4349864/ethan-klein-h3h3productions-fair-use-protection-account-fupa/
21:12:34 <BioPhone> Some dude Matt Hoss
21:15:21 <BioPhone> They filed for summary judgement and won, didn't have to go to court
21:16:40 <Camail> even better, don't waste that time or money
21:17:21 <Camail> maybe this makes IP abuse less likely
