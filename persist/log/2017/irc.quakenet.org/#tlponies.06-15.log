15:28:42 <Phearlock> hey doot
15:29:15 <Dot`> ferlak!
15:34:46 <Phearlock> Found out there's a WIP tabletop RPG of a sci-fi setting that's eerily similar to starsector lol.
15:34:49 <Dot`> .tell dub` http://imgur.com/gallery/xnxRzPK
15:35:03 <Dot`> sounds cool phear
15:35:55 <Phearlock> I do like the setting. Collapse of a golden age of interstellar colonization that doesn't go entirely WH40k about things.
15:36:34 <Phearlock> (Stars without number btw, to actually name the thing)
15:37:11 <Dot`> i recognise the name
15:37:25 <Dot`> doesnt that work of the Fate system?
15:37:46 <Phearlock> I'd answer that if I knew what the fate system was
15:38:06 <Dot`> and i would give you an explanation if i knew it well enough to describe
15:39:15 <Dot`> ah no, its the other one
15:39:44 <Dot`> itmejp ran a RollPlay with stars without number

16:44:54 <skram> time is money, friend
16:50:17 <Emily> maybe 1 hour of him is totally worth working 4 hours for it
16:52:50 <skram> maybe im actually a high class escort
