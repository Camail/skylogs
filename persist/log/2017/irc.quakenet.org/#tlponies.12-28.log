23:01:27 <DuB`> Tom Clancy's The Division Free Trial installed!
23:05:17 <carcinisation> i just solo killed a teleporter as moira, holy crap it takes a long time

23:14:03 <DuB`> carcinisation who dat?
23:14:08 <DuB`> The stream
23:14:40 <Camail> BioSC  you here? thinking we could begin the division trial tonight
23:14:57 <Camail> Dot i will paly with you whenever you get it downloaded, but it is a big ass game
23:15:01 <Camail> also it looks AMAZING
23:15:13 <Camail> like god damn it makes shitty NY streets look pretty
23:15:18 <Camail> grimy as fuck but pretty
23:16:12 <Camail> holy shit did they make bits more expensive on twitch
23:16:41 <Camail> they take a baseline 29% cut
23:16:47 <Camail> thats so not worth it
23:17:13 <Camail> even dealing with the assholes who chargeback on pay pal thats still not justifying the cost
23:18:40 <Camail> i know small microtransactions are inflated to make the mid level ones feel like a better deal, but even the first mid level purchase is twitch taking a 25% cut
23:18:44 <Camail> for basically no reason
23:19:01 <Camail> just purely as a money transferring service and a fucking badge
23:19:45 <Camail> ok nvm its always been this shitty, i thought i remembered it being lower
23:20:09 <BioSC> i can play for like an hour and a half
