19:55:27 <Zounds> 2011 feels like an eternity ago yet also no time at all :P
19:57:20 <Micen> I havent heard this one in awhile zounds
19:57:57 <Zounds> I remember when it got released
19:58:06 <Zounds> Folks lost their collective shit in glee at the mention of Bronies
19:58:18 <Micen> I remember that
19:59:02 <Micen> I was in one of the filly synctube channels when it came on. 
19:59:14 <Zounds> Ah it's too bad The Hub couldn't stick around
19:59:20 <Zounds> They had good promos and stuff
19:59:25 <Zounds> Dan vs was also a really fun show
19:59:49 <Micen> Havent seen it. only know of it through the pony related memes that came from it 
20:00:08 <Micen> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRC4Vk6kisY
20:01:04 <Zounds> haha
20:01:14 <Zounds> Well you should check it out at some point if you're looking for some entertainment
20:01:22 <Zounds> Nothing world shattering but it's a good time
20:01:48 <Micen> yeah, i have a backlog. Legend of Korra, Star vs the forces of evil, Gravity falls, and now Dan vs. 
20:02:09 <Zounds> Gravity Falls is also real good
20:02:17 <Micen> thats what ive heard
20:02:26 <Zounds> Never seen Star vs though I've heard it's good
20:02:53 <Zounds> Korra wasn't for me
20:03:03 <Zounds> Though The last Airbender is one of my fave shows of all time
20:03:43 <Micen> Star was fun, i caught a Groundhog's Day style episode and it had some fun twists on the formula. 
20:06:17 <Zounds> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV_0n5gp1fE
20:06:23 <Zounds> Classic PMV goodness
20:06:30 <Micen> and Airbender was good, but i watched it so broken up it didnt have as much impact as it would have
20:06:53 <Micen> i have one song i think of when i think of early fandom
20:07:34 <Micen> Ive linked it a few times, but its good. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaSKYmpWXZw
20:08:04 <Micen> and any of the Odyssey eurobeat.

20:20:52 <Zounds> :D
20:21:21 <Micen> i actually burnt myself out on this song to a point where i didnt listen to it for years 
20:21:33 <Micen> put it on again a couple of months and forgot how fun it is
20:22:14 <Micen> The early days of the fandom were truly great in how much was made on so little
20:22:28 <Zounds> I'm allergic to that sort of music
20:22:32 <Zounds> I used to like it
20:22:38 <Zounds> But now that I works raves and stuff so much
20:23:00 <Micen> oh it can get tiring but every once in awhile.
