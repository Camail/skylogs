02:17:59 <Micen> hello
02:19:20 <ZK> whats firearmor?
02:19:22 <ZK> hi micen
02:19:44 <Micen> firearmor is armor that is made of fire. duh
02:20:09 <Micen> and i have a dilemma
02:20:19 <Micen> I was invited to play some D&D
02:20:36 <Micen> this is the dilemma. 
02:20:57 <Micen> (not now, but next Saturday)
02:20:58 <DuB`> Nice Bio!
02:21:11 <ZK> why is that dilemma?
02:21:18 <ZK> are other players mean?
02:21:19 <Micen> because its 3.5
02:21:24 <DuB`> Do you like dungeons?
02:21:27 <DuB`> Do you like dragons?
02:21:31 <ZK> pathfinder or 3.5?
02:21:33 <Micen> and I cant decide if I want to break the game in amazing ways
02:21:35 <Micen> 3.5
02:21:53 <ZK> when playing roleplaying games i abide by two rukes
02:21:55 <ZK> rules*
02:21:59 <ZK> 1. Have fun
02:22:01 <ZK> 2. Don't be a dick
02:22:21 <ZK> both are very very important
02:22:40 <DuB`> 3. Get pickles.
02:22:51 <Micen> but the DM is basically challenging my ability trivialize the game, and insisting that the game is balanced. 
02:23:19 <ZK> yes, pickles are fun
02:23:31 <Micen> Pickles are important
02:23:56 <ZK> and na, he's saying he enjoys 3.5 and doesn't want to argue further with you saying that others are superior and just wants to play a game he likes
02:28:42 <Micen> thats the thing
02:28:54 <Micen> hes never played it. 
02:29:25 <ZK> oh then lol, why pick 3.5?
02:29:43 <Micen> because he had friends that played it years ago
02:30:31 <Micen> and he is also worried about other guy who hasnt played D&D before breaking the game because thats how he plays any tabletop game.
02:31:52 <ZK> RPing isn't about abusing the rules...
02:31:56 <ZK> Well, in my mind anyhow
02:32:34 <Micen> well still building a bard that has 50+ to bluff rolls at level 5 makes for a fun character. 
02:32:44 <Micen> I can talk anyone into anything
02:32:45 <ZK> so i guess you tried convincing him to go with 5e instead, but no dice?
02:32:51 <Micen> until i roll that Critical 1
02:33:48 <Micen> i mentioned 5e, PF, the group likes evil stuff so I also did OWoD since he is aware of that as well
02:34:09 <Micen> i mean i know PF is similar, but its getting better. 
02:34:40 <ZK> i thought pf was just 3.5, but kinda better
02:34:59 <Micen> PF was that, but its been seperating more since like 2015
02:35:09 <Micen> and becoming more of its own thing
02:35:19 <Micen> brb got to put pizza in before CritRole tonight

03:04:43 <Phearlock> I had fun playing some sins of a solar empire again today though, been like a year or more since last time lol.
03:05:13 <Phearlock> Still a nice game. If you combined that combat with stellaris planet management you'd have like almost a perfect 4x game.
03:06:56 <ZK> what s a really good 4x game?
03:07:48 <Phearlock> 4x is just like the modern term for those strategy games. It's like, um. Explore, expand, exploit, exterminate?
03:07:53 <ZK> i remember there was one about gods or somethin
