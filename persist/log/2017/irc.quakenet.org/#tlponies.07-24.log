21:33:20 <Camail> Twitch Is a Gaming Stream Service Where Streamers Can Share Their Gameplay With Their Viewers
21:33:26 <Camail> what a world we used to live in
21:33:33 <Camail> also people getting banned for not streaming games
21:33:39 <Camail> and now, they weebin
21:34:34 <skram> the weeb will inherit the earth cam
21:35:01 <Camail> so dub i'm watching an anime and i dunno if i hate it or not. But people are having orgasms because of high stakes gambling
21:35:46 <Camail> it's the only thing i've picked up this season...
21:36:04 <DuB`> Sounds reasonable.
21:36:06 <Camail> its like food wars but instead of food its high stakes games of chance
21:36:10 <DuB`> Hahah
21:36:13 <DuB`> Don't you hate those? :P
21:36:34 <Camail> obviously i hate playing them
21:36:49 <Camail> but watchjing someone get off to betting 100,000 on a dice roll is amusing
21:37:01 <DuB`> I see.
21:37:04 <DuB`> skram
21:37:08 <DuB`> I feel like you need this. http://nutiminn.is/kattarshians/
