11:50:09 <Dot`> that was HOURS before i got up
11:51:22 <Dot`> its really annoying when they show a scheduale on a stream without giving local time.....
11:51:37 <Dot`> as ias in the time the event is runnig on
11:51:47 <Dot`> so you have no point of refrance

11:56:55 <Dot`> https://www.twitch.tv/twitch
11:57:05 <carcinisation> or maybe that's just the pubg

11:57:26 <Dot`> haha
11:58:45 <Dot`> i saw pugb on the scheduale, but no idea on time

19:21:20 <Dot`> rawr pls, you should have done more ping pong
19:21:48 <Rawr|Fone> I agree, but there is only so much time in a day :/
19:23:37 <Zounds> gg Camail
19:23:41 <Camail> u done?
19:23:46 <Camail> oh
19:23:48 <Camail> yea it was nice
19:23:57 <Zounds> That tripp at the end though
19:23:59 <Zounds> what a dive :s
19:24:05 <Camail> yea, they wre mad
19:24:18 <Camail> she was stalking me for like 30 seconds before that
19:24:24 <Zounds> I saw them approaching you in stealth because she was poisoned
19:24:28 <Zounds> That's why I came to you
19:24:40 <Camail> she should've killed me
19:24:43 <Camail> she whiffed her dagger
19:25:31 <Camail> we won early game so hard
19:25:31 <Zounds> damn I clicked the screen after alt tabbing and it left queue
19:25:42 <Camail> aisling and oru had two pretty dumb deaths
19:25:45 <Camail> but other than that it was good
19:26:02 <Camail> oru diving for the first wound was...questionable
19:26:32 <Camail> i won a 1v2, i thinkt heir knossus was really bad
19:26:38 <Camail> he should've wrecked me
19:26:41 <Camail> maybe he didnt skill right
19:47:35 <Dot`> dub
19:50:27 <Camail> what a dumb team
19:50:31 <Camail> what a dumb, dumb team
19:50:50 <Camail> making me tank into a  xenobia
19:50:53 <Camail> fucking morons
19:50:59 <Zounds> :p
19:51:13 <Camail> they have a HEALER as their farthest creature
19:51:14 <Zounds> Yes the ranged were not really willing to co-operate with us
19:51:27 <Camail> are you kidding me, why did we not kill it ever
19:51:34 <Camail> why did we sit outside their point waiting for the attack
19:51:53 <Camail> they managed to play this long and not understand fundamental tactics, how

20:16:08 <Camail> why did they bum rush middle one at a time
20:16:09 <Camail> weird
20:16:25 <Zounds> Good for us :D
20:16:43 <Camail> that becket made a desperation 1v4 on our point...ok then
20:16:48 <Zounds> My talent build was all kinds of terrible that game
20:16:53 <Camail> or however you spell the name
20:17:15 <Camail> i worked mine out once i skilled into ranges primary attack
20:17:23 <Camail> mainly gave me freedom to work around the margrave
20:17:48 <Zounds> I should have gone the long range tounge build
20:17:52 <Camail> also getting better at using the melee attack in conjunction with the beam
20:17:53 <Zounds> instead i went for the combo reset one
20:18:03 <Camail> tongue is so good in team fights
20:18:28 <Camail> i tried saving you vs that voden
20:18:32 <Camail> it was a sad chase
20:18:38 <Zounds> I didn't actually know he was hurt already
20:18:44 <Zounds> All I knew was I was on the brink of death
20:18:51 <Camail> yea he was like 40%
20:19:07 <Camail> when recharging stamina there's no reason to walk forward, imo
20:19:14 <Camail> i think its the same speed
20:19:20 <Camail> as walking backwards, that is
20:19:29 <Zounds> Didn't know that
20:19:54 <Camail> just cant run backwards, thats th eonly downside

20:51:24 <Camail> worst team so far, easily
20:51:43 <Zounds> that game felt pretty long
20:52:08 <Camail> i admit i specced one skill wrong because i tought they were gonna initiate with knossus
20:52:24 <Camail> but they didnt because our range was bad at the game and couldn't kill anyone ever
20:52:40 <Camail> i dont understand why people just sit there and fight, and do nothing
20:52:59 <Camail> like...wtf have you seriously palyed this game 20+ hours and just stood there the entire time
20:53:22 <Camail> did not expect the knossus lurk
20:53:28 <Camail> but we gave him the entire map to roam for kills
20:53:35 <Camail> because our team is retarded

21:10:28 <Zounds> Yeah
21:10:32 <Zounds> Quite a lot of fun
21:10:41 <Zounds> idk if you noticed the most MLG play of all time at C point
21:10:54 <Camail> i saw you solo it twice but i was never there
21:11:08 <Zounds> I baited the Tripp in with half hp and ran to the edge of the cliff
21:11:09 <Camail> surprised we kept it
21:11:11 <Zounds> then knocked her off with the bounce goo
21:11:15 <Camail> ahaha
21:11:17 <Camail> she mad
21:11:40 <Zounds> I was pretty satisfied
21:11:46 <Zounds> That'll do me for now though

22:52:00 <Camail> we'll probably get something with that
22:52:05 <Camail> nothing so far
22:52:10 <Dot`> it was kind of implied with the egg
22:52:11 <reification> runbun you should be sleep by now!
22:52:15 <Camail> grubs and stag are important
22:52:21 <Dot`> RUNBUN
22:52:31 <Dot`> Hob got hit!
22:52:32 <Camail> i want something with the grubs
22:53:27 <Dot`> maybe old grub is like one of those fish that protects its young by swollowing them cam
22:53:36 <Camail> yea but i want to know
22:53:39 <Dot`> and he isnt just a complete bastard!
22:53:49 <Dot`> i too want to know
22:54:24 <Camail> did you complete the nail in your last run dot?
22:54:33 <Dot`> yea
22:54:42 <Camail> did you get the Good End for him?
22:54:45 <Dot`> im almost back to where i was
22:54:51 <Dot`> in like half the time
22:55:00 <Camail> so pro
22:55:12 <Dot`> speedrun
22:56:00 <Dot`> i saw an achievment for completing in under 5 hours
22:56:15 <Dot`> was there a speedrun of this at last agdq?
22:57:08 <Camail> yea
22:57:37 <Dot`> once i complete the game i tihnk i will like to have a look through that
22:57:40 <Camail> any% wr is 38 minutes
22:57:48 <Dot`> its fun to see how they break things
22:57:56 <Dot`> once you know the places
22:58:25 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1WWtWz1TBw
22:58:53 <Camail> i might be inclined to learn this game, maybe
22:59:32 <Dot`> 38 minutes is a nicelength for a speed run i feel, a bit on the high end but still nice
23:00:53 <Camail> well a normal run would probable be between 40-50 minutes
23:01:34 <Dot`> well yea, but over an hour i tihnk is getting long for anything i would want to do
23:01:45 <Camail> yea
23:01:48 <Dot`> i feel that 30-50 minutes is good
23:02:31 <Camail> https://youtu.be/X1WWtWz1TBw?t=4m18s
