14:19:42 <Dot`> skram
14:20:51 <skram> what are your plans today
14:20:58 <skram> i am bored
14:21:28 <skram> maybe you should scope out that gin and pizza place and tell me more about it
14:21:45 <Dot`> i played some games, and am now trying to study C programming again
14:21:47 <skram> ill wire you a few sterlings so you can get a G&T as thanks
14:22:09 <Dot`> ive been there before skram
14:22:14 <Dot`> its nice
14:22:52 <skram> kinda like you then
14:23:03 <skram> why are you studying C though
14:23:08 <skram> isnt that rather antiquated?
14:24:03 <Dot`> well a derivitive of C
14:24:08 <Dot`> becuase I didnt have the monies this year to study through uni 
14:24:28 <skram> what about next year!
14:24:29 <Dot`> so  ipicked up an ardunio board and then realised its been years since i programmed anything
14:24:35 <Dot`> will have to see skram
14:24:45 <skram> oh neat
14:25:06 <skram> I got an arduino too
14:25:26 <Dot`> you made it do things?
14:25:30 <Dot`> like blink an led
14:25:39 <skram> I prefer PLCs but I dont have 20k to drop on hardware and then another 20k on licenses
14:25:47 <skram> yeh
14:25:59 <skram> I bought the sparkfun kit and did the things included in that
14:27:23 <Dot`> nice
14:28:30 <Dot`> my uncle wants to do a thing for his model airplane battries that discharges them and monitors/plots the output
14:28:35 <Dot`> to test for failing battries
14:28:55 <skram> neat
14:28:58 <Dot`> shouldnt be too hard, but its a nice start, it has a few tricky parts in it
14:29:27 <skram> so you need some sort of load then
14:29:46 <skram> and to measure voltage and current and some sort of app that lets you output it to a graph
14:30:20 <Dot`> the arduino will have to detect the number of cells in that particulaour battry
14:30:43 <Dot`> then receive form a analouge to digital read of each cell
14:30:57 <Dot`> log and output a graph
14:31:11 <Dot`> and cut off the battries when ones output drops too low
14:31:48 <skram> what sort of batteries are these
14:31:53 <skram> LiPo?
14:32:19 <Dot`> i forget actually, i recall they range from 4 to 8 cells
14:32:23 <Dot`> it was a lithium
14:32:52 <Dot`> hence the need to stop the discharge
14:33:09 <skram> yeah
14:33:15 <skram> short circuits make them boom too
14:33:44 <Dot`> yea
14:34:34 <skram> how do you measure voltage and current with an arduino
14:35:27 <Dot`> thats what the analouge to digital converter is for which then feeds the data to the arduino
14:35:51 <Dot`> its been so long since i used all my electronics knowledge i forget the name of the device
14:35:57 <skram> what sort of AD converter
14:36:01 <skram> also why do you need that
14:36:06 <skram> arduino has analog inputs
14:36:28 <Dot`> but you dont know th enumber of cells to start with and you need to mesure each seprately
14:36:44 <Dot`> i think it only has 1 analouge input
14:37:00 <Dot`> there was a reason
14:37:45 <skram> it has 6
14:37:46 <skram> iirc
14:38:15 <Dot`> so it does
14:39:00 <Dot`> hmm, trying to recall now why we wanted the converter to feed to 1 input
14:39:27 <Dot`> i think it was so the development board didnt have to go into the device
14:39:48 <Dot`> you could remove the microcontroller and put it in the dedicated circuite
14:40:30 <skram> So you can run your thing without the arduino board?
14:40:47 <Dot`> the arduino board is a develpoment board
14:42:01 <Dot`> so its far cheaper to remove the atmel chip once programmed
14:42:19 <Dot`> and use it in a dedicated board
14:45:31 <reification> https://twitter.com/harrino_/status/911324062634438656
14:46:39 <skram> breadboards are permanent Dot`
14:46:44 <skram> did you not know this
14:46:55 <Dot`> ?
14:47:05 <Dot`> lol reif
14:48:15 <skram> Well if you make a thing you want to make on a breadboard and then decided to make it a permanent circuit, 9/10 times it stays as a breadboard prototype
14:48:16 <skram> 4ever
14:48:44 <Dot`> wxcept i have 1 breadboard so it gets taken apart
14:49:06 <skram> maybe you want breadboards for christmas then
14:49:14 <Dot`> and even if you remove the atmel at place it on the breadboard, you would still not have it on the develpoment board anymore
14:49:44 <skram> thats why you have jumper leads
14:49:56 <skram> so you dont have to pick the mc out
14:50:32 <Dot`> but the mc is like less than a pound
14:50:45 <Dot`> its far cheaper to buy that than a 20 pound development board
14:51:06 <skram> but its so much work dot
14:51:28 <Dot`> and i am poor
14:51:29 <skram> have to figure out all the pins and then make some sort of power supply and all that stuff
14:51:54 <Dot`> theres like 1 pound devices that convert ac to 5v dc
14:52:21 <skram> if you wanna be a kool kid you design your own
14:52:41 <Dot`> its what happens when your too poor to just rebuy develpoment boards skrammmen
14:53:04 <skram> or if you are lazy

15:36:01 <DuB`> I UNNO
15:37:30 <skram> i thought we was frens
15:37:38 <skram> and frens tell stories about butts to each other
15:37:45 <DuB`> Um
15:37:57 <Crisium> its a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake
15:38:09 <DuB`> I'm pretty sure this guy liked butts: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0b/9c/f9/0b9cf9aba9967a26573cce680ba65c6b.jpg
15:38:13 <reification> surely it‚Äôs rude to talk about cam when he‚Äôs not here?
15:38:16 <DuB`> Cuz' he had like a dozen ladies.
15:38:24 <DuB`> The Original Genji!
15:38:50 <skram> no doubt
15:38:52 <skram> very handsome
15:39:02 <DuB`> http://www.ohmigallery.com/Gallery/Ebina/Images/Ebina-Genji-51-1-x300.jpg
15:39:09 <DuB`> Look at all those ladies.
15:39:23 <skram> very nice hat too
15:39:35 <DuB`> (That's probably how he got so many ladies)
15:39:40 <DuB`> Gotta have a great hat.
15:40:27 <DuB`> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3KCapwu0QDU/TpUgpQD3hLI/AAAAAAAAADk/IVxVmYAU9_w/s1600/Tale_of_Genji_Toyokuni_Utagawa_print+2+%25282%2529.jpg
15:40:32 <DuB`> MMM dem eyebrows.
15:41:08 <skram> oh yeah
15:41:15 <skram> lady has serious eyebrow game
15:42:35 <skram> where do i find me a girl like that
15:43:22 <DuB`> Um
15:43:26 <DuB`> Heian-era Japan!
15:43:38 <skram> right
15:43:41 <skram> how do i get there
15:44:57 <reification> time machine
15:45:05 <DuB`> Well
15:45:06 <DuB`> https://i.imgur.com/XPFtLpz.png
15:45:20 <DuB`> As a resident of the ?MYSTERY BELT? perhaps I can help you there.
15:45:48 <DuB`> You'll have to come here first though. ;D
15:46:36 <skram> Hmm that doesnt seem so bad
15:47:32 <DuB`> They had to label it something because it's the actually-safe-place. :P
15:47:56 <DuB`> Besides the Future Impending MegaEarthquake I guess, but Cali is more famous for that. ;D
15:48:03 <skram> There's snoo though?
15:48:34 <DuB`> Yeh, just the north half though.
15:48:46 <DuB`> South half of utah is scorching redrock mars desert.
15:49:20 <skram> when are we going to moab to drive 4x4s?
15:50:20 <DuB`> Well it'd have to be before I move out of utah in 2 years!
15:50:50 <skram> nest year
15:50:52 <skram> get your jeep
15:50:55 <DuB`> But then I'll hopefully be in Cali or NY/Boston and there are plenty of things to do there too.
15:51:09 <DuB`> No fjords though. ;D
15:51:16 <skram> fjords are overrated
15:51:53 <DuB`> GASP
15:52:11 <Dot`> lies skram
15:52:32 <DuB`> I think skram just committed Norway Treason.
15:52:49 <Golly> its mountains next to water, so
15:52:54 <Golly> hes right
15:53:06 <DuB`> Mountains are the best!
15:53:09 <DuB`> And water is nice.
15:53:29 <skram> salt water is the worst
15:53:47 <DuB`> skram is no ocean man?
15:54:09 <Golly> he's a woodland creature
15:54:19 <DuB`> Right
15:56:15 <skram> what you really want is some neat pine trees and a shitty old stream
15:56:36 <skram> maybe a moose looking stupid and glaring at you
15:56:39 <skram> n a t u r e
15:57:14 <Golly> + a million gnats
15:57:46 <skram> thats why you bring a shotgun
15:57:58 <skram> to shoot mosquitos and hunt for pike
16:00:59 <Crisium> bees/10
