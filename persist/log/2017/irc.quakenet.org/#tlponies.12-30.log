05:54:03 <Camail> DuB`  this game is fun
05:54:39 <Camail> i tried the DZ, every enemy is the purple mega enemy
05:54:50 <Camail> makes life harder

06:33:12 <DuB`> DZ seems pointless, my experience was: try to extract stuff-> it gets hijacked -> try to stop guy from hijacking it and he one-shots me, and then can attack me for free from then on, and spawncamps the only nearby entrance
06:35:44 <Camail> eh, i got some stuff out, had more issues with the deluge of enemies coming tot he evac site than players
06:35:58 <DuB`> Like, a "manhunt" has started for this guy and he's just wandering around the area oneshotting everyone
06:36:43 <Camail> is he really high level or something
06:36:50 <Camail> maybe there's twinks in this game
06:37:29 <DuB`> 14
06:37:32 <Camail> i got killed then camped by a lvl15/99 guy then i just switched spawns
06:37:38 <Camail> yea but was his DZ rank high
06:37:42 <DuB`> 99
06:38:03 <Camail> yea probably just hangs around in dz1 killing people with the best gear for his level
06:38:18 <Camail> that's old school mmo trolling
06:38:49 <DuB`> Also, can ANYONE hijack regardless of rogue/attackable status?
06:39:16 <Camail> what exactly is hijacking
06:39:19 <Camail> stealing your stuff?
06:39:28 <DuB`> Players
06:39:50 <DuB`> As soon as I call extraction like 5 people show up.
06:40:27 <Camail> anyone can use the line, i think, but then people might just kill you because you're there
06:40:52 <Camail> for me only one player came in and it was a guy i was fighting with for a bit
06:40:56 <Camail> then like 20 npc's came
06:41:28 <Camail> i mean, people can roam around taking 4v1's if they really want to
06:41:33 <DuB`> I dunno, extracting things solo seems impossible
06:41:46 <Camail> we can DZ tomorrow or something
06:42:00 <Camail> maybe once everyone gets to 10 or 11 we can get a 4 man
06:42:25 <Camail> i got my dz rank up to 10 so i can by stuff from the dz1 stores, which is nice
06:42:41 <Camail> honestly, getting to rank 10 and just killing mbos to get dz money is good
06:42:57 <Camail> you can buy normal blue from the dz store without needing to risk extraction
06:43:05 <Camail> blues*
06:45:22 <Camail> i can join you now, if u want
06:46:47 <DuB`> No point unless there's a way to get a different instance that doesn't have this 14/99 guy.
06:47:42 <Camail> i kinda want to fight him
06:49:44 <Camail> yup thats a twink alright
06:49:51 <Camail> i dont know why you keep trying
06:50:03 <Camail> after one death I'd just relog
06:50:09 <DuB`> I did, lol
06:50:15 <DuB`> This was second try.
06:51:05 <Camail> join on me
06:53:15 <Camail> wat
06:53:37 <Camail> ok so i have an idea
06:53:45 <Camail> I'll go to the higher level one
06:53:48 <Camail> and we'll work ourw ay down
06:53:51 <Camail> to avoid the twink
06:54:26 <Camail> oh wait nvm better idea
06:54:37 <Camail> we just dont do DZ because lvl 14 twinks are a big thing
06:54:44 <Camail> eh, I'll try one more time
06:59:00 <Camail> DuB` 
06:59:03 <Camail> we call extrac when we want
06:59:07 <Camail> then we run to the other one
06:59:10 <Camail> juke the twink
06:59:12 <DuB`> Sure
06:59:22 <DuB`> He might be gone?
06:59:25 <DuB`> Don't see manhunt alert.

07:32:21 <Camail> invite him lul
07:35:27 <Camail> LMFAO
07:35:29 <DuB`> LOL
07:35:33 <DuB`> Oh hi named boss
07:35:43 <Camail> we killed named guys before
07:35:46 <Camail> but not in dz2
07:35:48 <Camail> lol
07:44:46 <DuB`> They all spawned already on top of the roof >_>
07:44:51 <Camail> DuB` extracting in dz2 maybe not the best idea
07:45:10 <Camail> lets grab our stuff then head back to 1
08:03:29 <Camail> DuB`  think i am done with dZ for the night
08:03:39 <Camail> ah
08:03:40 <Camail> convenient
08:03:45 <Camail> i was done anyway
08:03:45 <DuB`> ...
08:08:32 <DuB`> Ye gg
08:08:42 <DuB`> DZ is pretty fun when you can just roam and fight
08:09:05 <Camail> its also fine when there are rogues, just not twinks who power trip on easy kills
08:24:44 <Camail> well i should probably be done playing games for the night
08:25:01 <Camail> DZ is kinda nerve wracking, just cuz all the enemies are so resilient

10:58:13 <Micen> is it you Cam?
10:58:45 <CockRoach|42> it could be literally anyone
11:00:00 <Camail> well, its a gendered pronoun
11:00:05 <Camail> so that cuts out a majority of humanity
11:00:24 <CockRoach|42> you'd be surprised
11:01:10 <Camail> i dont think the number of transgendered people even puts a dent into the 1% majority women have
11:02:28 <Camail> micen we had our first run in with a lvl 14 twink in the DZ
11:02:30 <Camail> it was rough
11:02:44 <Micen> ouch 
11:02:46 <Camail> like...why tho
11:02:56 <Camail> lvl 14 but rank 99
11:03:24 <Camail> why do they spend so many hours grinding just to have meaningless victories over vastly undergeared people
11:03:40 <CockRoach|42> it's just a prank, bro
11:03:55 <Camail> well, it adds to the idea of it being a wild town
11:04:16 <Camail> i sure wish the DZ was bigger to make this kind of gameplay less about spawn camping tho
11:04:38 <Camail> I'm not new to over powered bullshit trolling, I played Ultima on a pvp shard
11:04:48 <Camail> you had to work real hard just to get out of the first town
11:05:08 <CockRoach|42> sounds like a lot of fun

11:05:27 <Camail> but i have a tolerance for it

17:06:05 <Camail> solo DZ is hard
17:06:16 <Camail> i'm in the 15-19 zone now
17:06:24 <Camail> instead of 10-14
17:06:47 <Camail> i managed to get a purple SVD out tho
17:06:57 <DuB`> Wew
17:07:13 <Camail> i called an extraction, held out, got fucked and died, ran to my body and hooked onto the line 10 seconds before it left
17:07:22 <DuB`> lolol
17:07:26 <DuB`> I got a 10kdps SCAR yesterday but hate that gun. :P
17:07:35 <Camail> the dps on scars are a lie
17:07:40 <DuB`> Somehow still prever 4k bolt action
17:07:44 <DuB`> prefer
17:07:45 <Camail> i trashed a 20k dps scar for this svd
17:07:53 <DuB`> Ye
17:08:24 <Camail> unless you can make a build that ups the stabilization its too hard to actually use the dps
17:09:17 <Camail> I'm leaning more towards using rifles, anyway
17:10:21 <Camail> dub, dot didnt like his character so he restarted, but my theory is he saw his time limit of 6 hours on the trial and panicked so he skipped all the cutscenes
17:10:48 <Camail> he's almost back to the level of his first character

17:15:37 <Camail> dub i got like 5 scarves but none of them are exactly what I want
17:15:43 <Zounds> I see!
17:15:45 <Camail> I think i understand some of your daily despair
17:15:49 <Zounds> I've played it a bit in the past on PS4
17:15:53 <Zounds> My brother likes it a lot
17:16:34 <Camail> its fun so far
17:16:37 <Camail> we havent played much
17:17:02 <Camail> well I've palyed a lot, but mainly just the first 10% of the game 5 times
17:17:12 <Camail> as I've co-oped with trial ppl
17:17:42 <Dot`> cam, your theory about me wanting to watch cutscenes is correct! amaxnig how you guessed it after i told you thats why i restarted
17:17:52 <Bio> lel
17:18:04 <Camail> but you didnt tell me that you skipped thme for your first guy
17:18:23 <Camail> i assumed you took the 2 minutes out of your time to watch
17:18:35 <Camail> but then i had to put myself in a dot state of mind
17:18:45 <Camail> and the panic made we realize you mashed through it all
17:19:04 <Dot`> constant state of panic!
17:19:26 <Camail> it doesn't explain why you then decided to level the alt character, but I honestly don't care beyond a passing curiosity
17:20:00 <Dot`> i havnt got the third wing up and running
17:20:05 <Dot`> lvl 6 atm
17:21:55 <DuB`> I got med wing to 70% and there's STILL trash on the floor!
17:22:07 <DuB`> Someone get me a broom, I'll do it myself.
17:28:18 <Dot`> im also going around looking around corners and stuff
17:28:31 <Dot`> found 3 doors to lockpick!

18:12:35 <Camail> ok so i had division on in the background for a long time today and now i cant stop hearing sirens in my head
18:13:00 <Dot`> lol, i use to get that with the phones at work
18:13:23 <Dot`> in IT our main office had a call center section
18:14:00 <Dot`> could still hear those phones ring when i got home
18:14:21 <Camail> but what if a real cop car crashes into my house
18:14:26 <Camail> and blazes its sirens
18:14:31 <Camail> i wont be able to hear it
18:15:26 <Dot`> what you need to do is move country where the sirens are a diffrent sound
18:15:33 <Dot`> then you can tell

23:18:28 <skram> tell me more
23:20:14 <Dot`> whiskey is a large orange tomcat
23:20:35 <Dot`> who enjoys crawling inside my bag
23:42:20 <Camail> i read your last message first
23:42:27 <Camail> and got really confused to whom you were asking
23:43:34 <Camail> So I think I'm gonna sit at 19 and slowly build gear in the DZ
23:43:49 <Camail> wait for everyone to catch up, and be relatively kitted out by that time
23:44:01 <Camail> levelling is incredibly fast if you do all the side missions
