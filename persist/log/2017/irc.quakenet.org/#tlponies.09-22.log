19:31:46 <DuB`> dun did
19:31:53 <Dot`> .roll d20 for dub badness
19:32:03 <DuB`> Oh hey, .tells.
19:32:10 <Camail> yup
19:33:58 <Bio> sweetiebot pls never leave us
19:35:09 <Dot`> cam, once its on sale i will look at it
19:35:16 <Camail> I've always kinda wanted to get the bot to auto reconnect but the code is so fucking messy
19:35:29 <Camail> well it just came out dot so I'll have beaten it
19:35:33 <Camail> but honestly, this story is replayable
19:35:47 <Camail> especially because there are 5 main characters and you only get to hear one story each playthrough
19:36:32 <Camail> or was it 6? i think 6
19:36:43 <Rawr|Fone> Not enough dub
19:36:58 <DuB`> Is ther
19:37:03 <Camail> Dot`  also this game is fucking hard
19:37:09 <DuB`> an evil girl sorceress character? ;D
19:37:16 <Camail> like there's 3 difficulty mode, easy, medium, and hard
19:37:21 <Camail> they dont need a very hard, or a nightmare
19:37:25 <Bio> dub tonedown the anime
19:38:34 <Camail> the best part of the game so far is me learning that dogs cant use ladders
19:38:52 <Camail> so a teleported an enemy dog onto a platform and functionally took him out of the fight in a single turn
19:39:09 <Bio> so realism!
19:57:36 <skram> can goats use ladders though
19:58:19 <Bio> yes
19:58:29 <Bio> I played goat simulator

22:39:13 <Runbunny> Completely legal. Since I didn't make any mistakes and didn't harm myself with the chemicals.
