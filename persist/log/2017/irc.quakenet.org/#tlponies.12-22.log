02:09:36 <DuB`> Oho
02:10:09 <DuB`> Divinity still only 10% off
02:10:15 <DuB`> $40 bah
02:17:22 <Dot`> sillyness
02:17:36 <Dot`> thats many pizzas
02:22:09 <Camail> I'm thinking of buying the division
02:23:12 <Camail> oh neat, there's a free trial
02:23:25 <Camail> well I'd be willing to try it with a stack if we can get it coordinated
02:27:57 <Dot`> i was dissapointed with it when i tried the open beta
02:28:28 <Camail> it got an overhaul patch recently, which is the onylr eason its on my radar
02:29:14 <DuB`> Trial, sure!
02:29:39 <Dot`> i can play free things
02:30:06 <Camail> fpsrpg is like, my unicorn
02:30:39 <Camail> i have always wanted one to really get into, and the closest is destiny but thats really not what I want
02:30:59 <DuB`> UHHH MY TERABYTE DRIVE IS FULL
02:31:04 <DuB`> wat do
02:31:14 <Camail> dub you probably have some junk files to erase
02:31:22 <Camail> i just cleared 100gb off my ssd like a month ago
02:32:09 <Camail> https://windirstat.net/ this is the one dot(?) linked me
02:32:21 <DuB`> Why was there 140gb of HEARTHSTONE???
02:32:22 <DuB`> ???
02:32:33 <Camail> you should check that out
02:32:39 <Camail> maybe they don't deleted installers
02:33:28 <DuB`> Ok 200GB free now haha
02:33:30 <DuB`> That was easy. :P
02:33:44 <Camail> pls
02:34:31 <Camail> also if you have an AMD gfx card you can delete th eAMD folder
02:34:46 <DuB`> Naw
02:34:50 <Camail> they unpack installers there then never clean up because they like keeping full fucking back ups
02:39:52 <Camail> having to figure out what to get people for christmas is rough
02:40:19 <Camail> i have 2 out of 4 and those are 5* gifts, but i have no fucking clue what to get my parents
02:41:33 <DuB`> We do a sibling-gift assigned rotation every year
02:41:43 <DuB`> Just buy one good gift for one sibling
02:42:18 <Camail> well that'd be easy more me, seeing as i have one sibling
02:42:54 <Camail> his Gift to me this year is tickets to evo, so that's a solid win for me
02:43:23 <DuB`> Noice
02:45:15 <Camail> oh wait no i have 3, forgot i already got my dad something
02:45:27 <Camail> still...the comfortable deadline for figuring out what to get is tonight
03:42:56 <Camail> I'm replaying KOTOR and i have a pretty decent 30 AC
03:43:07 <Camail> this is the only game I've ever replayed, and its my third run
03:43:13 <Camail> dunno if its nostalgia...i dont think it is
03:43:20 <Camail> I'm pretty sure its just a great game
