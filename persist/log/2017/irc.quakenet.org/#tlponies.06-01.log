01:28:01 <DuB`> Bah, I hate packing.
01:33:37 <Camail> shirt a day, pants for each potential climate, toiletries, tada?
01:33:58 <Camail> or just a speedo
01:37:30 <Bio> i actually found an aglet in the jangl
01:37:44 <Bio> sk8r boi boots get
01:37:52 <Bio> though not as usefull now with wings
01:38:51 <DuB`> In quite a few hours of fishing and pretty exhaustive exploration of our entire original world I found 0 aglets.
01:39:10 <DuB`> Eventually just made a bunch of new worlds and searched easily accessible surface chests.
01:39:16 <DuB`> ... still took two whole worlds.
01:48:25 <Camail> Bio  spectre boots are still important for movement speed and it also increases wing flight time
01:48:37 <Camail> movement effects stack
01:48:41 <Bio> ah
01:48:43 <Bio> k
01:49:06 <Camail> also i forgot that our world has titanium, which also works for the armor set
01:49:24 <Camail> also fuck the travelling merchant i'm waiting forever for a chance to get the dps meter
01:49:54 <Camail> all i need are the 3 fisherman items and 2 travelling merchant items 
01:50:11 <Camail> also after 6 wall kills i finally got my ranger emblem

02:12:10 <Camail> DuB`  Bio  we should do twins tonight, i have some fright souls so we can share those and make stuff that requires all three souls
02:12:22 <Camail> i have 2 eyes on me
02:12:38 <Bio> hokay
02:12:39 <Camail> i tried solo but they ended up despawning because i wasnt quite sure how their despawn worked =/
02:12:56 <Bio> we can do heart statues and honey if it helps
02:12:59 <Camail> killed one and got its trophy and the other one was too far away
02:13:11 <Camail> honey isn't worth it imho
02:13:23 <Camail> honestly health regen isnt as important as not getting hit
02:13:28 <Camail> because damage is so mcuh higher
02:13:54 <Camail> just have a quick teleport finger when you get below 100
02:14:07 <Camail> dying is way way way worse than the walk back
02:14:13 <DuB`> Um
02:14:18 <DuB`> Right now or never for me.
02:14:21 <DuB`> Gotta pack.
