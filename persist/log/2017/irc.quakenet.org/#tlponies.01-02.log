06:15:04 <Camail> .tell dot` pandemic is 2-4,  Samurai Spirit is 1-7 players, those are the two purely cooperative board games I suggest. Mice and Mystic looks fun but I haven't learned it yet so someone else would have to figure that out
06:18:51 <Camail> .tell dot` as for deception games, dead of winter is 3-5, spyfall is 4-8, betrayal at house on the hill is 3-6, spyfall is 5-10, and battlestar galactica is 4-6
06:21:13 <Camail> .tell dot` those are in order of least deception to most deception, then comes secret hitler at 5-10 players. Then moving on to purely adversarial/competitive games we have Love Letter at 2-4 players. And lets keep the list to about that length for now.
06:24:02 <Camail> .tell dot` In conclusion: I suggest we play Pandemic or Samurai Spirit first, then go from there. Love letter is a good stepping stone from there because it is really simple.
06:36:42 <DuB`> :o
06:41:05 <Camail> these 8 games can easily cover like, a years worth of play

06:54:22 <Camail> was brutal

07:02:24 <Bio> do we all have to buy it
07:03:58 <Camail> buy what
07:04:02 <Camail> you dont have to buy anything
07:04:19 <Camail> these are all marketplace mods
07:04:27 <Bio> o
07:08:33 <Bio> thats a better thing
07:10:04 <DuB`> Mods for what?
07:10:56 <Camail> table top simulator
07:12:46 <Camail> hmm, dead of winter has a new version that came out last year, will have to check that out tomorrow to see how well it was implemented
07:13:17 <Camail> the mod said it has scripts so i dunno if the automated stuff will make it easier or harder
07:24:51 <Camail> OH SHIT
07:25:03 <Camail> markman is jwong's agent
07:25:05 <Camail> thats weird
07:25:26 <Camail> jwong's contract probably wasn't that good tbh
07:25:31 <Camail> he's had a full time job all this time
07:25:43 <Camail> maybe now he can hunt for a really solid contract? who knows
07:26:33 <Camail> most esports communities aren't aware of this, but jwong is top 5 in america and doesnt even play every day
07:26:40 <Camail> if he really put that work in that'd be great

18:19:24 <Zounds> I got similar things in my placements
18:19:37 <Runbunny> lel
18:19:38 <Zounds> One blowout after another but thankfully I was on the right side of half of them
18:19:46 <Runbunny> Placements is understandable.
18:20:00 <Runbunny> I don't think I had people below diamond though.
18:20:03 <DuB`> My placements were super consistent.
18:20:12 <Runbunny> as were mine :D :D :D
18:20:16 <skram> If you place a group of masters against a group of diamonds/plat/grandmasters, the group of masters is probably gonna win even if avg rank was equal
18:20:16 <Runbunny> 7 losses :D
18:20:34 <DuB`> Yeah, I saw only two people out of 120 I played with who weren't diamond.
18:20:42 <DuB`> Even though I had never been diamond before?
18:21:08 <skram> Well they changed rankings somehow in s3
18:21:15 <DuB`> Yup.
18:21:50 <skram> Its not perfect but it seems to be way more even in s3 than it was in s2
18:22:06 <DuB`> Even?
18:22:08 <Dot`> DUB <3
18:22:31 <skram> And some of my friends who were around the same rank as me in s2 struggle to reach diamond in s3 so thats an added bonus
18:22:35 <DuB`> Dot <3
18:22:36 <skram> Yes DuB`
18:22:43 <Runbunny> Dub you should make the journey to 1 rating.
18:23:26 <DuB`> 1!?
18:23:45 <Runbunny> 1!
18:23:56 <Runbunny> Claim the title of "Ichiban"
18:24:13 <DuB`> 1 rating, not rank 1? :P
18:24:20 <skram> DuB` Runbunny Dot` Zounds reification we plej now
18:24:22 <skram> go eu
18:24:24 <skram> Cane too!
18:24:26 <DuB`> Okej
18:24:51 <DuB`> I heard that the first time someone got to 1 SR in the first season it bugged and looped him back around to the highest rating.
18:24:59 <DuB`> Went from 1 rating to rank 1! :D
18:25:07 <skram> :D
18:25:20 <Runbunny> O:
18:25:54 <DuB`> Event over yet?
18:26:11 <DuB`> Gotta decide whether or not to spend 3000 of my 4500 on zen skin.
18:26:11 <skram> few more hours
18:26:37 <skram> not big enough of a fan of it to spend 3000 points on it
18:26:49 <skram> even thought i have almost 9k lol
18:26:59 <DuB`> ...
18:27:15 <DuB`> It's the only winter legendary for a character I play at all.
18:27:22 <DuB`> Besides meis, which isn't THAT great.
18:27:32 <skram> but it is
18:27:37 <skram> iceblock has a santa hat!
18:27:58 <DuB`> But she's not nearly as cute as yeti hunter. >:T
