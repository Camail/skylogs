00:00:20 <motbob> it's kind of hard to believe that games like Anthem could exist

00:03:03 <motbob> oh, camail, do you watch THE READS?
00:03:15 <Camail> DuB`  want me to give you the yoyos before i forget so you can do stuff
00:03:16 <motbob> the cross counter series?
00:03:17 <Camail> yea mot i do
00:03:26 <Camail> its pretty great
00:03:32 <motbob> i helped produce the next batch of episodes
00:03:36 <Camail> nice
00:03:52 <motbob> and made a trailer that may or may not be used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8EWueDgkCw
00:03:59 <motbob> no leakaroni pepperoni
00:04:05 <Camail> rip
00:06:27 <Camail> "cross counter blah blah"
00:06:33 <Camail> haha
00:06:38 <Phearlock> lol nice
00:06:41 <motbob> please tell me if/why it sucks so that i can make a v3
00:06:53 <motbob> i want to please my bosses
00:07:00 <motbob> which are gootcks and bobby scar
00:07:49 <Camail> well I'm always a fan of post splash screen footage so thats good
00:07:56 <Camail> lemme watch it again
00:09:44 <Camail> the text at the beginning can be polished, it's aliased and the way it comes on screen is static not really attention grabbing. I like the beginning with toph and scar lamenting, thats a fun idea
00:09:55 <Camail> the idea of the opener is super solid wouldn't change anything conceptually
00:10:19 <Camail> I like all the clips
00:11:12 <motbob> what I personally like about this trailer is that it doesn't even spoil the best shit
00:11:59 <Camail> thats good, thats usually the fatal flaw of a trailer
00:12:05 <motbob> I agree the text is boring
00:12:09 <motbob> i don't know what to do
00:12:32 <motbob> this is really not my area of expertise, i have literally never made this type of content before and I'm struggling
00:12:58 <motbob> actually i guess I can watch some excellent adventre trailers
00:13:03 <Camail> also the text for introducing phil covers some of the footages and it just so happens to be exactly where the foxes are
00:13:37 <Camail> yea I'm not entirely sure what to do with the text, maybe look at their previous trailers or some movie trailers
00:14:19 <motbob> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoXFqyT8S-0&t=50 WHAT THE FUCK
00:14:49 <Camail> yea thats dope
00:15:31 <motbob> i'll just use all the default Vegas Pro fx until the text is fancy enough
00:15:42 <motbob> just keep adding them
00:16:04 <Camail> make that Frankenstein's monster  text
00:16:19 <motbob> i think it's OK for the text to be covering the foxes
00:16:24 <motbob> i want people to be reading the text
00:18:44 <motbob> at the very least I can add a little bit of blur to get rid of the aliasing
00:19:24 <motbob> ^ this is actually a skill i learned from typesetting anime
00:19:51 <motbob> actually, come to think of it, I could probably do the text in my anime subtitling program and make it look fancier...
00:21:32 <Camail> doesnt hurt to try
00:21:34 <Camail> unless it does
00:24:13 <motbob> now i'm finding all these cool effects
00:24:19 <Phearlock> Bit more of a border on it to make it a bit easier on the eyes when it's overlayed on the bright backgrounds
00:24:22 <motbob> like something to blur the scar/toph boxes in the intro
00:25:20 <motbob> this is an Anime Standard border size and so I'm not gonna change it
00:26:12 <motbob> no, the real reason is that to change the border size, Vegas makes you change each text box's properties individually
00:26:45 <Phearlock> oh
00:31:31 <motbob> looks like they want me to scrap the text
00:31:45 <motbob> oh well see you guys later after i take a course in video editing
00:43:18 <Bio> https://i.redd.it/2phpainklz2z.jpg

01:00:18 <Camail> puerto rico wants to be a state
01:00:27 <Camail> thats interesting
01:02:23 <carcinisation> wasn't there a boycot of the vote by largest party?
01:05:12 <Dot`> .tell runbunny http://imgur.com/gallery/7CBMV
01:19:15 <motbob> my highly advanced video editing skills led me to change the font https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZJ0Bnkgayg
01:23:34 <Phearlock> I wonder if just "magic" is maybe better than "some magic"
