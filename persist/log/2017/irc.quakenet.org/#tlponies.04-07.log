01:01:19 <motbob> <DoT_> motbob, can you explain in english what this is about
01:01:35 <motbob> it just makes the united states into a more majoritarian syste,
01:01:50 <motbob> it's easier to get things done with a bare majority now
01:02:00 <motbob> that's all
01:06:19 <DuB`> Oh yeah, dot.
01:06:22 <DuB`> Why riots? O_o
01:08:33 <DoT`> The #SA1st Forum has called for a human chain along key main roads into the Cape Town city centre, including the main road from Simons Town, Voortrekker Road from Bellville, and the West Coast Road, Marine Drive.
01:09:01 <DoT`> apparently a lot of people not plannign to go into work, its expected to get nasty
01:09:37 <DoT`> ty mot, though that sounds like a bad direction
01:10:29 <DuB`> ... but why human chain!
01:11:07 <DoT`> i guess a mixture of disruption and showing unity
01:27:32 <Bio> asdf
02:06:33 <motbob> anyone have some adderall
