08:25:11 <Runbunny> O:
08:25:47 <Runbunny> Who do we pray to Dot?
08:26:15 <DoT|Phone> it's a chance to put your small animal killing skills to use!
08:26:50 <DoT|Phone> hmm. does buddah like sacrifices?
08:27:46 <DoT|Phone> we can pick one of the ancient Egyptian gods
08:29:17 <DoT|Phone> there are options
08:30:03 <DoT|Phone> there is one other person on this bus and they seem to be about to cry
08:35:10 <Runbunny> hmm.
08:35:56 <Runbunny> if we pick like small rodents under 150g of weight it's legally fine to kill them while they are conscious.
08:36:32 <DoT|Phone> if we starve a rabbit it may get there
08:36:37 <Runbunny> above 150g they have to be sedated. 
08:37:07 <Runbunny> rabbit is a problem since it is not sufficient to kill them by cervical dislocation
08:37:54 <Runbunny> but we can overdose it on anesthetics and exsanguine it for a lot of blood.

14:14:26 <Zounds> how is skram, skram?
14:16:29 <Dot`> reif, what gets elected in a genral election?
14:17:56 <skram> skram is good good zounds
14:17:59 <skram> how a boat you
14:20:18 <Zounds> i'm okay skram
14:20:38 <Zounds> Each constituency votes for an MP to represent them in parliment dot
14:24:44 <Dot`> so why we doing one of those votes?
14:31:59 <Zounds> depends on who you ask I guess
14:32:34 <Zounds> perhaps she's confident that more tory MPs will win so she has more support and less people acting against her in parliment
14:55:52 <reification> clearly generals dot :p
14:57:22 <reification> polls suggest may is in an incredibly good position (+20)
14:57:52 <reification> wants to take advantage of corbyn failings and get a proper mandate as pm
14:58:42 <reification> remember she was never elected as such, only got the job cause of cameron screwing up bigly
15:03:01 <reification> oh and had to wait till now cause article 50 actually triggered
15:04:15 <Dot`> but this isnt going to replace the PM is it? its for replacing MP's
15:04:17 <reification> on the whole itâ€™s likely to turn out nicely for lib dems and blairites (labour faction)
15:04:36 <reification> the pm is decided by the mps
15:05:09 <reification> you win majority of mps (or form coalition)
15:05:24 <Dot`> i thought we had elections for ruling party who would have a PM kind of being the face
15:05:31 <Dot`> politics is confusing
15:06:05 <reification> no the whole system was setup before parties where really a thing
15:06:27 <reification> they in fact functioned partly as a workaround to harsh campaign spending limits
15:06:47 <Dot`> so there is only 1 election and whoever holds the most of parliment is then the ruling party
15:06:49 <Dot`> kinda
15:07:12 <Dot`> and parliment is made of of the varies MP's from the constituancies
15:07:25 <reification> yep
15:08:05 <Dot`> so there is nothing like in america where they vote in a party, its a culmination of all the areas voting in individuals
15:08:29 <Dot`> this seems very ad-hoc
15:08:31 <reification> there are no primaries if thatâ€™s what yourâ€™e talking about
15:10:12 <Dot`> one more to clarify
15:10:32 <Dot`> so no one would for instance vote of labour, they would vote the the labour MP in thier area
15:10:33 <reification> regular mps used to have a lot of power dot, itâ€™s been slowly eroded but the ruling party does face rebellions fairly often
15:10:42 <reification> yes you got it
15:11:29 <Dot`> i mean , it kind of sounds like an ok system, like it may allow for balancing of various parties
15:11:34 <reification> for example when carswell defected from tory to ukip he still won easily cause voters liked him personally
15:12:52 <Dot`> so whast an MP do if he isnt elected to parliment? how many MP's are there in each area
15:13:11 <Dot`> potential MP's*
15:13:31 <reification> go back to your day job
15:13:39 <reification> 1 mp per area
15:14:13 <reification> the system of linking mp to region is quite popular see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum,_2011
15:14:15 <Dot`> so a potential MP is just a regualur random person?
15:14:36 <reification> you can run dot
15:14:41 <Dot`> woohoo
15:14:50 <reification> you must merely register and put up a deposit
15:15:03 <reification> which gets refunded if you get 5% vote
15:15:24 <Dot`> this vote you linked looks like what brexit vote was suppose to look like
