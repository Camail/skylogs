01:48:39 <DuB> Checkmate!
01:48:42 <Micen> Then its civil war
01:48:56 <skram> Apparently they dont care about foreign nationals visiting and beating the shit out of american civillians, Micen

16:32:44 <Yoltphone> Hi pones !!
16:32:46 <Dot`> bio
16:32:53 <Yoltphone> Dot <3
16:33:02 <Dot`> hey yolt
16:33:04 <Rawr|Fone> Yoltphone â¤â¤â¤
16:33:31 <Yoltphone> Hi rawr !
16:33:39 <Yoltphone> My soccer team did it !
16:33:43 <Yoltphone> http://m.bbc.com/sport/football/39973807
16:33:45 <Rawr|Fone>  ğŸ‘Œ
16:34:15 <Dot`> a kickball thing
16:34:20 <Dot`> gj
16:34:28 <Yoltphone> 4 promotions in 6 years ğŸ˜„
16:34:48 <Yoltphone> Next step is champion's league
16:37:34 <Yoltphone> I cried a bit
16:38:29 <Micen_> its a big deal for fans of teams
16:39:11 <Yoltphone> Even more for a team which faced bankruptcy 6years ago
16:39:14 <Micen_> its a shame that there are not sports like that here in the states where teams can move leagues based on skill
16:40:09 <Yoltphone> Yes, american leagues suck
16:40:12 <Yoltphone> :P
16:40:15 <Dot`> rawr http://imgur.com/gallery/4laut
16:40:20 <Yoltphone> Not enough passion
16:40:38 <Micen_> its true 
16:40:55 <Micen_> players can move up or not move at all. but they cant be demoted if bad. 
16:41:42 <Micen_> Here's a question about your sportsball
16:41:56 <Micen_> how do you keep good players from sitting in lower leagues and dominating? 
16:42:14 <Micen_> or is it just there is too much pride to want to do that?
16:42:41 <Dot`> you all know rugby is best
16:42:50 <Dot`> a sport for manly men
16:43:11 <Micen_> I tried watching Rugby. 
16:43:19 <Micen_> I had no clue what was going on. 
16:44:43 <Yoltphone> There is money too micrn
16:45:15 <Yoltphone> Let's say a second ligue player will earn 4000 or 5000kâ‚¬ per mpnth
16:45:21 <Micen_> true. but if i could make a little less moeny for a lot less work in just beating scrubs all day i would do it
16:45:32 <Yoltphone> First ligue player will get 15000 or more
16:45:49 <Yoltphone> Then you have bonus if you win
16:45:52 <Dot`> micen, it splayed by peope tha hit thier heads a lot, the rules are simple
16:46:08 <Micen_> i guess im used to real sports. Like Baseball
16:46:32 <Yoltphone> Lazy players go to Saudia, or China, or Turkey, earning lot of money in bad championship
16:46:43 <Dot`> can only pass back, no head tackles(still happens), get the ball across the lilne for 3 points, then get a free kick to try get it through the posts for more points
16:46:51 <Rawr|Fone> If a good player wants to play in a bad league, there is nothing that stops him
16:47:29 <Rawr|Fone> Here in sweden, there is a top 50 player who plays in the sixth division
16:47:37 <Yoltphone> https://twitter.com/_Dhean/status/865968668743790592?s=09
16:47:39 <Rawr|Fone> Hasn't lost a game in several years
16:47:53 <Yoltphone> Celebration time !
16:48:13 <Yoltphone> 10k people :D
