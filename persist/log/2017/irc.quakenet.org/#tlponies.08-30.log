03:02:07 <Raelcun> asdfwefa;lkjfweafsd
03:02:12 <Raelcun> too cute
03:17:33 <Camail> MENAT IS OG
03:17:42 <Camail> she is the best
03:40:51 <Cane> http://i.imgur.com/uWv0rim.gifv
04:41:38 <Camail> Cane have you seen menat
04:51:32 <Cane> Camail, yeah I have, she's like the only character so far that made me question my decision not to pick up the game.
04:51:57 <Cane> She reminds me of Viola from Soul Calibur with her orb attacks.
04:53:26 <Camail> i've only ever seen viola played, but the whole translation into 2d makes it pretty different
04:53:47 <Camail> its kinda like rosalina
04:53:54 <Camail> whre if she has the orb her normals are nutso
04:54:09 <Camail> and if she places the orb her normals are shorter, but comboable
04:54:37 <Camail> also all her v trigger orbs are stored negative edge style like sf4 juri
04:54:40 <Camail> but one for each button
04:54:53 <Camail> and no start up or recovery animations
04:57:12 <Camail> her movement is where her weakness is
04:57:23 <Camail> so probably not your  kind of character
04:58:03 <Cane> I played the hell out of Juri. She was my main towards the end of SFIV.
04:58:28 <Cane> Still disappointed in her transition into SFV.
04:58:34 -!- Golly [~Golly@1.92-221-121.customer.lyse.net] has joined #tlponies
04:58:40 <Camail> I'm not, but we can agree to disagree
04:58:47 <Cane> Sounds good.
04:59:10 <Cane> Who do you play? I've barely talked SFV with you.
04:59:13 <Camail> juri
04:59:34 <Cane> Cool, how's she treating you?
04:59:38 <Camail> she's waaaay better than people think
04:59:48 <Camail> not a tier, but at least mid tier
05:00:26 <Camail> she's the opposite of menat, juri's neutral is stupidly hard but very rewarding
05:00:46 <Camail> second best mobility in the game
05:01:01 <Camail> and her s.mk is probably like the 5th best move in the game
05:01:06 <Cane> Does Infiltration still pull her out some times?
05:01:22 <Cane> Feels like a silly question since he plays every character.
05:01:27 <Camail> he tried, but he also doesnt play much at th emoment
05:01:33 <Camail> newly married and doing non-player things
05:01:34 <Cane> Poo.
05:01:50 <Cane> Has he been doing the IRL streamer thing that's so popular in Korea?
05:02:00 <Camail> he doesnt even stream much
05:02:06 <Camail> i rarely see him online
05:03:23 <Cane> That's kinda disappointing.
05:04:10 <Camail> its more of a lifestyle thing, he definitely didnt quit the fgc cuz of sf5
05:04:20 <Camail> he played sfxt
05:04:29 <Cane> I just hope he's happy. I really like that guy.
05:05:03 <Camail> hard to know, but i doubt he's had any issues
05:05:17 <Camail> honestly, punk is the new hotness
05:05:31 <Cane> I've heard.
05:05:34 <Camail> like, top 3 fighting game players alive right now
05:05:47 <Camail> top 1 sf5 player, arguable with tokido but still the best
05:06:09 <Camail> he has the best reactions on the planet free
05:07:46 <Camail> i also thought you'd care about the scene especially when nuckledu has been playing so well

16:52:41 <DuB`> You have to learn to embrace it.
16:53:06 <Micen> but skooks paved the way for pony. 
16:53:36 <Micen> and I am not a weaboo. I am full on Otaku. 
16:54:09 <Dot`> otaku sounds super weeb
16:54:34 <Micen> its like the cool opposite of a weeb. 
16:54:40 <Micen> weebs are nerds 
16:55:03 <Zounds> Doesn't otaku have major negative connotations
16:55:13 <Micen> most likely. 
16:56:48 <Micen> "When these people are referred to as otaku, they are judged for their behaviors - and people suddenly see an “otaku” as a person unable to relate to reality" direct quoted quote from Wikipedia Zounds
17:01:46 <Zounds> Unable to relate to reality, I've some sympathy for that
17:01:59 <Micen> I know, right?!
17:02:19 <Zounds> I've been a hairs width away from slipping into hermit nerd my whole life
17:02:34 <Zounds> But with a lot of effort it's been getting better throughout the years
17:03:03 <Micen> I accept that i am destined to be a hermit 
17:03:48 <Micen> and now places like the local Kroger and Wal-mart  allow you to order online  then just go pick it up and someone will bring it out to your car and load it for you.

18:52:57 <DuB`> Not even on sale, hah!
18:53:28 <motbob> well
18:53:37 <motbob> if someone couldn't make it to the eclipse
18:53:47 <motbob> but someone else caught it on camera for them
18:53:57 <motbob> obviously they need eclipse glasses to watch that
18:54:03 <motbob> so there's still a use for them
18:54:29 <motbob> or if they recorded the CNN eclipse newscast on DVR

19:36:02 <Runbunny> O: Camail.
19:36:11 <Camail> roon do u wanna play
19:36:55 <Runbunny> Nah, not right now.
19:37:11 <Runbunny> playing distorted travesty 3 atm.
19:37:26 <Camail> that sure is a name
19:37:41 <Camail> is that an anime game
19:38:07 <DuB`> Hah
19:38:10 <Camail> gonna restart my game
19:40:23 <Camail> my meta restart is strong
19:40:38 <DuB`> You WERE the problem.
19:41:34 <Camail> DUB
19:41:39 <Camail> ITS YOUR FAULT NOW
19:41:43 <DuB`> Nuh uh
19:41:52 <Camail> i fixed my problem
19:42:04 <Camail> if this one fails you two should restart
19:42:18 <DuB`> It was someone on their team that time, though.
19:42:19 <Camail> the networking is kinda shitty sometimes
19:42:29 <Camail> it doesnt matter what the message says
19:42:40 <Camail> it says whatever it thinks is right
19:42:55 <Camail> but with disconnects its impossible to tell if the network is unstable enough
19:43:24 <Camail> also DuB`  if you wanna play margrave take allt heother character off your queue list
19:43:38 <DuB`> Ye
19:43:48 <DuB`> Perhaps we're less likely to get tripp mains this way? :P
19:45:31 <Dot`> cr http://imgur.com/gallery/oHVsv
20:07:23 <Camail> DuB`  margrave isnt trip
20:08:43 <Runbunny> Camail it's like kinda an anime.
20:09:16 <Runbunny> http://distortedtravesty.blogspot.dk/
20:10:29 <Camail> thats not anime
20:10:31 <Camail> thats pixels
20:10:40 <Runbunny> It's very anime
20:10:47 <Runbunny> and like no fourth wall at all.
20:11:29 <Zounds> camail why do you hate my blue goo of safety
20:12:10 <Camail> its almost impossible to see anything during a team fight
20:12:36 <Zounds> It's fine it's just sometimes I notice when you're retreating it looks like you're actively avoiding it
20:12:48 <Camail> I'm just trying to be unpredictable
20:12:53 <Camail> so they dont follow me
20:13:17 <Zounds> Ah well it gets some use anyway when I just throw it amongst us all for the 20% armour
20:13:17 <Camail> so you try and guess where I'm trying to go
20:13:23 <Camail> but I'm also juking you unintentionally
20:13:39 <DuB`> It was just hard for me to play in the front against HK until I got my reflect.
20:13:48 <DuB`> Should've skilled that sooner.
20:14:17 <Camail> also during a clash, just because its 100v100 and we're defending, we sohuld still all be in base
20:14:33 <Camail> they were still able to dps it down
20:14:48 <Zounds> Yeah I chased the HK like a big dummy there
20:14:57 <Camail> is fine
20:14:58 <Camail> we learn
20:15:04 <Zounds> Was a good win though in the end
20:15:13 <Zounds> decent match
20:15:23 <Camail> we floundered in the mid game
20:15:29 <Camail> the griselma made us scatter
20:15:34 <Camail> because we put a healer in the back
20:15:36 <Camail> terrible idea
20:15:43 <Camail> healers are usually trash in this game
20:15:49 <Zounds> I was about to say
20:15:54 <Zounds> I really don't like the bloomers

20:21:30 <reification> good timing for dnd :p
20:23:02 <Camail> DuB`  do you have reflect yet?
20:31:44 <Camail> yea we had a mozu and a margrave and the hk kept doing damage
20:31:50 <Camail> thats how you lose
20:32:12 <Zounds> That trip lived in my asshole
20:32:14 <Camail> that mozu was terrible
20:32:29 <Camail> the hk should've never been able to fire
20:32:34 <DuB`> As soon as I'd hold still to reflect in a choke the tyto+ramsay would 100-0 me in 3 secs
20:32:43 <DuB`> :T
20:32:53 <Camail> yea our team comp didnt do enough damage
20:33:34 <Camail> margrave/zandora/sven only works if the other two are pure dps
20:33:44 <Camail> that vadasi was annoying
20:33:52 <Camail> we never had any focus fire on her
20:34:03 <Camail> we didnt have any fast dps to deal with her
20:34:14 <Camail> they wont he team fights for free
20:34:17 <Camail> and we never flanked
20:34:23 <Camail> also we never upgraded our creatures
20:34:31 <Camail> which was really bad early game
20:49:53 <Dot`> rawr http://imgur.com/gallery/4zC1c
20:50:35 <Rawr|Fone> .tell Dot` <3
20:50:50 <Camail> we started that game off with 2 immediate kills
20:50:52 <Camail> was pretty nice
20:50:54 <Zounds> ggs Camail DuB` that'll do me for now
20:51:05 <Camail> dub you almost get rank 5?
20:51:07 <DuB`> ... I think it's applying all my xp to tripp?
20:51:16 <DuB`> Still at like 4.4 with margrave, at 8 now with tripp.
20:51:17 <Camail> thats not a thing tho
20:51:22 <Camail> wtf
20:51:35 <Camail> does it show margrave's icon at the end fo the game
20:51:47 <Camail> lets play a bot game
20:51:51 <Camail> and see if what happens
20:52:17 <DuB`> gg Zounds
20:52:19 <Zounds> Their Imani left in that last game btw at the clash
20:52:26 <Zounds> I dunno if you even noticed because she was awful
20:53:03 <Zounds> Or at least having a bad game
20:58:49 <DuB`> That one worked, I think?
20:58:54 <DuB`> Not a lot of xp.
20:58:55 <Camail> yea i noticed she rage quit, was amusing
20:59:08 <Camail> yea its not a lot, was just seeing if you were actually getting it
20:59:14 <Camail> brb
21:01:31 <Camail> back
21:01:39 <Dot`> are you
21:01:44 <Camail> maybe

21:01:54 <Dot`> still dnd
21:02:00 <Dot`> there are orcs
21:02:02 <DuB`> 2long >:T
21:02:03 <Camail> THEN PAY ATTENTION TO THE ROLE PLAYING 
21:02:04 <Camail> GOSH
21:05:57 <Camail> WHY
21:05:59 <Camail> WHYYYYYYYY
21:06:01 <Camail> WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

21:19:18 <Dot`> thats nice
21:30:48 <Camail> DuB`  our dps this game was so shitty
21:30:53 <Camail> ou8r shooters didnt do anything
21:31:06 <DuB`> 60% of my life every kill was imani >_>
21:31:35 <Camail> worst becket i've ever played with
21:31:53 <Camail> dub you played in bad positions vs her, tho
21:32:01 <DuB`> Never fight -> no deaths -> great efficiency rating!
21:32:03 <Camail> in the early game you were hiding behind a rock
21:32:14 <DuB`> Once!
21:32:22 <Camail> i saw 2 times, at least
21:32:26 <Camail> one pillar, one rock
21:32:31 <DuB`> I got trapped between mozu and her
21:32:33 <Camail> the one at th epillar you were at full health!
21:32:43 <Camail> they couldnt kill you!
21:32:52 <DuB`> k
21:32:58 <Camail> but yea our ranged was garbage and didnt know how to play
21:33:17 <Camail> voden was particularly useless
21:33:21 <Camail> didnt even shut down the imani
21:33:44 <Camail> becket didnt get ANY kills...like wtf

21:59:01 <Camail> oh, you wre the one who DCd
21:59:14 <Camail> nah i think if you rejoin you get it
21:59:26 <Camail> i got an honor bonus
21:59:28 <Camail> so that was nice
21:59:39 <Camail> also getting 20 kills was nice
21:59:48 <Camail> they didnt understand that i had burst damage
22:01:01 <Camail> the built i picked was really good anti knossus
22:01:16 <Camail> if i switched the healing to weakening it might've been better
22:03:54 <DuB> I enjoy when they have no range and I can pick the pure-damage right hand thing.
22:04:21 <DuB> Loses all reflect+defense and does lotsa burst+slow as you hold it on them.
