03:24:26 <skram> its like 4 years old
03:24:28 <Camail> especially because nvidia made a response to the budget gpu amd released
03:24:32 <Crisium> you could stick with ivy bridge for a bit more
03:24:42 <Bio> I dunno Dot`, most of the shit we were stuck on seemed like strange interactions and remembering the 100 of things we could do
03:24:45 <Bio> with items
03:25:03 <Crisium> skram just get a new gpu
03:25:28 <Crisium> you COULD get an all new build, but unless your budget is very large, youd get more value just upgrading GPU
03:25:37 <Crisium> since you said "budget" ill assume you're not aiming for the stars
03:25:51 <skram> got like 500 dollarinos
03:25:54 <skram> so no
03:26:01 <Crisium> GTX 1070
03:26:04 <Crisium> call it a day after that
03:26:15 <Crisium> re-evaluate CPU + MOBO + RAM in a few years
03:26:48 <Crisium> dunno what rune stone to usd evaluations are, but 1070 is under $400 here
03:26:49 <skram> so do you think gpu is the biggest bottleneck at this point?
03:26:57 <Crisium> for gaming, yes
03:27:07 <skram> could i play witcher3 at like medium
03:27:08 <Crisium> for other things, no
03:27:18 <Crisium> with a 1070 you could play ultra ish
03:29:06 <skram> cheapest I could find is 505 dollars
03:29:17 <skram> soo maybe go for that then
03:29:20 <Crisium> well there you go
03:29:24 <Dot`> bio, knowing the rules helsps understandig item interaction
03:29:41 <skram> ...If it can physically fit inside my tower that is
03:29:50 <Crisium> there is a mini version if you need it
03:29:53 <Crisium> might cost more
03:30:19 <Crisium> https://www.techpowerup.com/223807/gigabyte-unveils-the-geforce-gtx-1070-itx-graphics-card
03:30:25 <skram> Eh, ill just bring out the hacksaw
03:30:38 <Crisium> i assume the fewer fans and smaller heatsink the louder tho
03:31:54 <skram> how much does manufacturer matter
03:32:08 <skram> im assuming all 1070 cards have the same parts/speccs
03:32:31 <Crisium> 1) noise and power consumption 2) warrenty 3) factory overclocks
03:32:44 <Crisium> warranty*
03:32:47 <Crisium> what is engrish
03:33:03 <DuB`> skram do you have any more lovely "maching a clock in a home shop"-esque video series hanging around?
03:33:05 <Crisium> i have no idea what is best
03:33:05 <Bio> YOU CALLIN ME A SCRUB DAWT
03:33:07 <Bio> <3
03:33:28 <Crisium> some US sights use cowboy talk to determine best card
03:33:30 <Crisium> https://www.google.com/search?q=gtx+1070+roundup
03:33:32 <Crisium> round em up
03:33:37 <Crisium> us sites*
03:33:38 <Dot`> .butt bio
03:33:42 <Crisium> again, english is hard
03:34:10 <DuB`> OH, I HAVE BW TO GO WATCH.
03:34:13 <DuB`> Weee~
03:34:24 <skram> DuB`: THere's always Colinfurze's channel. None as lovingly edited as clickspring though.
03:34:29 <Dot`> bio, i think its silly to trust ME to recall all the rules
03:34:44 <DuB`> I want to marry clickspring.
03:35:16 <Dot`> like how i interpreted boons :P
03:35:30 <DuB`> Probably the only person who could make me watch 5 hours of home machining and then want to spend an hour of my morning researching various escapement designs.
03:35:42 <DuB`> Grasshopper escapements are wild!
03:36:49 <skram> I do have some parts laying around that I was never able to make work, even though I sent them in to the store who promptly told me it was working properly
03:38:05 <DuB`> Stork v Jaedong VOD time, woop woop~
03:38:57 <Crisium> *restrain from saying anything*
03:39:02 <Crisium> *maybe i said too much already*
03:39:21 <DuB`> Eh, I'm already spoiled. Still hype. :D
03:39:24 <skram> Crisium: A 4th generation i5 will not work with a 3rd generation motherboard y/n?
03:39:31 <skram> I have no idea about any of this stuff anymore.
03:39:38 <motbob> use pc part picker
03:39:56 <Crisium> look up your specific mobo
03:40:02 <Crisium> manufacturer should have it on the website
03:40:24 <Crisium> you have a spare haswell i5?
03:40:58 <skram> Yes. Though I dont know if it works or not.
03:41:09 <Crisium> i dont think so
03:41:29 <Crisium> yeah, haswell is lga 1150, ivy bridge is 1155
03:42:06 <skram> Oh dang
03:42:23 <DuB`> O_o
03:42:30 <DuB`> This is why I haven't built my own pc.
03:42:35 <Crisium> theres usually only 5-10% improvement per intel generation, its not the biggest deal
03:44:01 <Crisium> as in, 1070 + your ivybridge > than if you bought new mobo +1060 or rx 480
03:48:08 <DuB`> Off to find food out in the cold.
03:48:33 <skram> Yeah, think i'll just get the gpu
03:49:25 <DuB`off> Ooh, fun.
03:50:11 <skram> I built a PC for my dad about 2 years ago for his office, but I never got the damn thing running
03:50:29 <motbob> that's bad
03:51:46 <skram> It would bluescreen right after installing OS, sometimes during the restart stage, but I couldnt figure out WHY
03:52:05 <skram> The bluescreens all had different messages that would point to different things
03:52:35 <skram> Which I thought would mean a faulty mb, which I sent in to gigabyte
03:52:44 <skram> Who sent it back to me and told me it was working properly
03:52:52 <skram> So either they're wrong or the cpu is dead
03:53:08 <Crisium> if you get 1070, cause you going from amd to nvidia make sure you use DDU right before you install it http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html
03:53:46 <skram> cool
04:02:14 <skram> thanks cris

17:42:38 <skram> but if we git gud it will probably take us way less time to find moves
17:42:54 <skram> and that would probably make it more fun
17:42:55 <skram> i think
17:43:20 <DuB`> My thoughts are that I can only play any games at all on the OCCAISIONAL fri+sat, and really can't do 7 hour sessions of anything anymore.
17:43:59 * Zounds baps Cane
17:44:03 <Dot`> dub, as i said to skram, a game of 4-6 people SHOULD take a max of 4 hours
17:44:03 <skram> fair enough
17:45:13 <Dot`> dub, we can play one with us 3 and see how that goes? or we can play pandemic? or even any other game someone wants
17:45:28 <skram> regardless we should finish the one we currently got going
17:45:30 <skram> at some point
17:45:40 <Dot`> ya
17:46:00 <Dot`> i think it will end soon and not well :P
17:46:06 <DuB`> I would also like to OW for the first time all week before EU zZz. >_>
17:46:55 <skram> that reminds me

20:34:29 <Camail> i didnt know they found ACE in a link to the past
20:36:28 <Camail> well they couldnt have programmed the game itself, or else the glitches wouldn't work
20:36:52 <Camail> unless they are literally the best programmers in the world

20:37:26 <Camail> yea its some sort of emulator

20:49:39 <Camail> why is james chen at agdq!?!?!?
20:52:01 <Camail> lmao
20:52:05 <Camail> using 3 consoles
20:52:05 <Cane> This is some ridiculous shit, hahahaha
20:52:11 <Camail> to make one emulator
20:52:16 <Camail> HOW DO THEY TOP THIS
20:52:19 <CockRoach|42> that is quite impressive :)
20:52:25 <Camail> do they just build an actual person next year
20:52:35 <Bio> i feel like we say this every time
20:52:40 <Bio> but they always do
20:53:04 <CockRoach|42> they seem to be able to impress us each year :)
20:53:20 <Phearlock> Probably make TASbot play BW vs Flash or something
20:53:26 <CockRoach|42> haha
20:53:31 <Camail> well is the anywhere to go
20:53:35 <Camail> that actually means anything
20:53:44 <Camail> like..after this you are just using old chips to do w/e you want
20:53:55 <Camail> is it even a console if you push farther
20:53:57 <CockRoach|42> Phearlock: that should be suggested to them :)
20:55:29 <Bio> last 4 games
20:55:41 <Bio> ds3, windwaker, supermetroid, then undertale
20:55:43 <Golly> i saw a raelcun
20:55:50 <reification> yep
20:55:53 <Camail> nah that was nuclear backwards 
20:55:55 <Phearlock> I'll probably sleep after windwaker
20:56:29 <Bio> nucleaR
20:58:51 <Cane> TASBot is always fantastic.
