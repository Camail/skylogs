00:04:37 <DuB`> Uh oh
00:04:51 <Micen|droid> Walking a big doggo
00:05:22 <DuB`> Dot is the bakewell tart named after your bakewell?
00:05:27 <DuB`> I want one now.
00:08:36 <Dot`> yes
00:08:46 <Dot`> we have many places here tha sell them
00:08:50 <DuB`> O boi
00:08:51 <Dot`> feel free to come get
00:08:53 <DuB`> Also
00:08:57 <DuB`> https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g209968-Activities-Bakewell_Peak_District_National_Park_England.html
00:09:17 <Dot`> the monsel trail does indeed start here
00:09:21 <DuB`> It looks like literally the most stereotypical "british countryside" place ever.
00:09:22 <DuB`> Hahah
00:09:34 <Dot`> chatsworth house is indeed fancy
00:09:39 <Dot`> as is haddon hall
00:09:50 <DuB`> Those look very nice.
00:09:53 <Dot`> you see that old house museum
00:09:59 <Dot`> thats next door to me
00:10:02 <DuB`> :D
00:10:21 <Dot`> its good stuff bront
00:11:24 <Dot`> why are you stalking my town
00:11:28 <DuB`> Man, the VERY oldest buildings in my entire state are barely 150yrs.
00:11:45 <Dot`> i live in a 500 year old barn
00:11:51 <DuB`> :O :O :O
00:12:13 <DuB`> Well this book takes place in UK and it made me wonder randomly if your little town had ever shown up in literature or something.
00:12:29 <Dot`> it was used to hold the tithes from bakewell
00:12:44 <Dot`> its been converted to houses now though
00:12:47 <Dot`> no more tithes
00:12:50 <DuB`> Such history.
00:13:00 <DuB`> You should make people pay tithing to you.
00:13:01 <DuB`> ez
00:13:13 <Dot`> true
00:13:53 <DuB`> Man, I wish I lived in a thousand-year-old town.
00:13:58 <DuB`> We don't have a medieval bridge!
00:14:14 <Dot`> its a pretty bridge
00:14:20 <Dot`> the swans are nice too
00:14:25 <skrma> DuB`, old houses are kinda overrated unless its been fitted with modern insulation :P
00:14:41 <DuB`> But to LOOK AT, skram! 
00:14:43 <DuB`> Haha
00:15:20 <DuB`> I can take comfort in my pretty mountains and fast net, at least.
00:15:47 <skrma> My friend lived in a 300~ year old farm house and it was ALWAYS cold
00:16:06 <skrma> ...He also claimed there were bats in the loft but I never saw any
00:16:19 <DuB`> That's so ooooooooooold
00:16:24 <DuB`> Like, as old as my COUNTRY.
00:16:25 <DuB`> Waow
00:16:37 <Dot`> your country also has bats
00:16:44 <DuB`> Um
00:16:48 <DuB`> I suppose so, yes.
00:17:05 <Micen|droid> But they are not old bats
00:17:21 <DuB`> A melting pot of bat cultures.
00:17:22 <reification> night all
00:17:35 <DuB`> Reef!
00:17:36 <Dot`> gnight reeeef
00:17:37 <DuB`> G'night.

00:18:09 <skrma> There's viking/iron age burial grounds around where I live too.
00:18:20 <Micen|droid> Dub, the detached garage at my house or the old stable has bats in it
00:18:45 <Micen|droid> I think. 
00:18:59 <Micen|droid> You should come find out. K

00:20:16 <skrma> n e a t

00:20:55 <skrma> very neat dirt mounds though
00:21:01 <Dot`> true
00:21:06 <Micen|droid> Come visit our mounds of dirt! They are historic! 
00:21:15 <skrma> oh and there's a petroglyph near where a live

19:59:00 <reification> today’s important paper - giving crocodiles helium to learn about dinosuar speech http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/15/2442
20:00:06 <Dot`> SCIENCE
20:00:51 <Rawr|Fone> Advanced science
20:00:55 <reification> hmm i saw that bill nye video dot. i’m not sure about science anymore
20:03:30 <Zounds> he ruined it for everyone
20:10:38 <DuB`> o boi
20:11:01 <DuB`> I did a regedit thing to make things install/download properly to my terabyte drive instead of the tiny ssd.
20:11:13 <DuB`> Now I can find word/excel and all my shortcuts are broken.
20:11:27 <DuB`> In better news, I am okay at quake!
20:12:41 <reification> robot https://twitter.com/25bravofox2/status/854907610692173824
20:14:46 <DuB`> Pharah and zarya trained me well for rocket launcher and lightning gun. <3
20:15:11 <reification> usually it’s the other way round
20:21:42 <Rawr|Fone> I bought the lego racers game for ps1
20:21:47 <Rawr|Fone> Who wants to play
20:22:09 <DuB`> Haha!
20:22:24 <DuB`> I think I had game on our old family pc.
20:23:49 <Rawr|Fone> I had it on pc when I was younger, but it doesn't work on any computer I have
20:24:06 <Rawr|Fone> But the ps1 version is the exact same, so I bought that one
20:24:45 <Rawr|Fone> It's too bad I can't do that with the harry potter games
20:25:03 <Rawr|Fone> The first harry potter game on pc is 12/10
20:25:18 <Rawr|Fone> But the console version is an entirely different game
20:30:53 <DuB`> I remember in lego racers the only powerup worth going for was the green boost - you could get it up to lv3 and it turned into a wormhole that would let you skip like half a lap.
20:30:54 <DuB`> So OP.

23:16:54 <DuB`> Otherwise not really.
