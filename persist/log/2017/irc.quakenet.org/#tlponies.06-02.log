15:21:54 <Dot`> ONE DAY
15:23:20 <ZK> your turn to dm Dot`?
15:24:09 <Bio> One day...
15:24:18 <Dot`> i have actually considered it, but I would make a bad DM, cant do voices/accents and probably get picky on rules even if i try to not be
15:24:45 <Micen__> Dms dont have to do voices dot
15:25:07 <Bio> matt mercer makes everyone look bad
15:25:18 <skram> screw that, i wanna hear dot do voices
15:25:20 <Micen__> and if you establish you are playing a game rules as written, your players will know what to expect
15:25:21 <Bio> cuz its his jerb to do voices
15:25:23 <skram> DOT DO VOICES
15:25:34 <Bio> i can only do horse voices
15:25:36 <Bio> neigh
15:25:39 <ZK> yea, fak matt mercer
15:25:55 <ZK> he too good
15:26:13 <Micen__> I recommend this video series by Mercer and Satine Phoenix. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT9570U87GhK_20NcbxM43vkom
15:26:31 <Micen__> He's so good he gave advice on how to DM
15:26:40 <Dot`> i really have a lot of issues with crit role
15:26:51 <Micen__> and anything they havent gotten to yet, Colville has answered. 
15:26:59 <Dot`> and i wouldnt bother to compare ANY dnd to what they do
15:27:01 <ZK> theres quite a few resources on how to dm
15:27:04 <ZK> also on how to do voices
15:27:27 <skram> tell me a boat them Dot`
15:27:29 <ZK> whats your issues with it Dot`? I dont follow it enough
15:27:34 <Micen__> Just curious, like what? The power creep? The fact that its a job and they dont seem to know rules as written, know what their spells do, Combat too fast?
15:27:41 <ZK> all i know is matt mercer has good voice
15:28:02 <Dot`> hmmm, where to start, dont get me wrong, what they do is amazing, and ive watched a fair bit
15:28:34 <Dot`> but a few of the peoples mannerisms set me off, like masisias large arm sweeps that almost knock people out, when she wants attention
15:28:51 <Dot`> the gift giving from wveryone, its nice, but its gotten way overboard
15:29:01 <Dot`> its obnoxious
15:29:35 <ZK> characters in game gift giving, or...?
15:30:06 <Dot`> the way so many use it as a refrance for how to dnd
15:30:18 <Dot`> no zk, like the people watching giving
15:30:26 <Dot`> gifts are good, they show appreciation
15:30:31 <Dot`> but its way out of hand
15:32:05 <Micen__> Well you cant just tell people to not to. That would be rude. Also they really did cut that back once Talks Machina started, and they moved the gifts to that series. 
15:33:06 <ZK> good good
15:33:35 <ZK> but yea, mannerisms of characters can remove some of the fun
15:33:39 <skram> Well they sorta do what they want with house rules and shit, and I dont think thats a bad thing Dot`
15:33:46 <skram> totally agree on the mannerisms thing though, lol
15:34:10 <ZK> yea, everyone house rules to make the game more like they want
15:34:28 <Dot`> i have no issue with the house rules and the dming, thats amazing
15:36:00 <skram> also dont think you can blame people for using it as a reference for doing the things, since thats sorta what you do
15:36:44 <Micen__> yeah, it makes D&D "cool". It helps promote the brand as something more than something that is secretly played in basements. 
15:37:01 <Dot`> its when people compare thier own games to it thast the issue skram, and get down, or complain and such its not as good
15:37:42 <ZK> oh, you mean everyone expecting their DnD playing to be like that podcast?
15:37:45 <skram> thats a issue with people and not the show itself Dot`
15:38:01 <Micen__> Yeah, thats an issue, but not one they can help. They are trained in the art of telling a story, and getting paid to do the gig doesn't hurt either. 
15:38:21 <reification> runbunny https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAzP7MCUMAAzCrL.jpg:large
15:38:37 <ZK> were they paid from the very start, or that developed?
15:38:47 <skram> probably the former
15:38:53 <Dot`> but like at the start of this conversation, first thing is saying things like you cant be like matt mercer, like thats not really a good comparison or refreance for 99% of people
15:39:12 <Micen__> yeah they were paid from the start of the show. (two real life years into their campaign)
15:39:15 <Dot`> skram, as i said its a great show, but the issues i ave arrise around it, so are connected
15:39:24 <Micen__> the first two years were not broadcast
15:39:46 <Runbunny> lel

15:42:17 <skram> we dont talk about the accident reif
15:42:37 <Micen__> I misread something upthere thinking there was some accusatory remark or something due to being distracted by games on my main screen
15:42:40 <ZK> accidents are for wimps
15:43:00 <Dot`> I still need more DnD though
15:43:18 <ZK> yea, havent played in months either

15:46:02 <ZK> september sounds like good time
15:46:58 <ZK> if i do dnd, will you play Dot`?
15:49:09 <ZK> hmmm, which setting to do. Sci-fi, fantasy, science-based fantasy, star wars, samurai, so many choicesss
15:49:43 <Micen__> Why not try out something like Fate core and build the setting in your session zero?
15:50:02 <Runbunny> Dot`, Rawr|Phone http://i.imgur.com/FbUcVxx.mp4
15:50:47 <ZK> i dont like fate core as a system that much
15:51:05 <ZK> its ok, but some things i get in it i get better in other systems
15:51:19 <ZK> oooh, i should try 80s action movie system
