19:58:36 <Runbunny> It's kind of annoying that streamers has started using the word "meme" instead of "joke"
19:58:40 <Runbunny> and other words.
20:00:33 <Dot`> yes
20:02:45 <Dot`> meme is very overused
20:03:22 <Dot`> especialy as a term for inside joke

21:09:15 <Camail> these robots are scary
21:10:22 <Camail> this is an example of how rapidly people can generate storylines out of bots saying vaguely related things
