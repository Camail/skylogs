03:33:19 <skram> I had a thought
03:33:37 <skram> being the observer in a 25 million dollarydoo tournament must be one of the most stressful things ever
03:33:54 <motbob> the observers have five years of experience at this point
03:34:05 <motbob> it can't be that bad
03:35:09 <Camail> there was this one time
03:35:16 <Camail> where the observers missed a courier kill
03:35:22 <Camail> and he was frantically trying to find it
03:35:24 <Camail> was funny
03:35:39 <Camail> cursor flying everywhere on the screen
03:35:48 <skram> :D
03:35:58 <Camail> failed, then gave up

17:35:31 <Runbunny> Is Dot not wholesome enough for you?
17:36:24 <skram> His wholesomeness is greatly offset by your perversions, anders
17:37:57 <Runbunny> Why are you letting my perversions bother you? I don't shove them too far down your throat I believe. I'll be more careful in the future, sorry.
17:39:08 <skram> cancel anime, runbun

22:43:20 <Phearlock> So the latter
22:43:27 <Camail> thats good
