01:27:31 <skram> I dont know
01:27:50 <skram> There's certainly nothing wrong with my attack torb and hanzo plays
01:28:41 <reification> zarya is always nice to have
01:29:23 <skram> moira has a weird sort of relationship with d.va
01:29:29 <skram> their skills sorta counter each other
01:29:39 <skram> d.vas probably more so
01:32:44 <DuB> Moira's blobs are annoying.
01:33:07 <DuB> They last forever and can kill you on their own if they happen to bounce right.
01:33:26 <DuB> Like, ages after the moira has already FORGOTTEN about the dumb thing
01:33:39 <DuB> s k i l l s h o t
01:35:32 <skram> thats when you go dva and just gobble it
01:36:00 <DuB> But dva doesn't have shurikens
01:36:03 <DuB> Or sleep darts
01:36:17 <skram> she has more rockets than any other hero
01:36:29 <DuB> But they're LAME
01:36:29 <skram> ROCKETS, JAKE
