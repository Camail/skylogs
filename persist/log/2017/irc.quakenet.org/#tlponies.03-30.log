00:53:12 <motbob> how would you express the idea that another person is needy in various ways, but that you love that other person enough to meet those needs
00:53:25 <motbob> express it succinctly*
00:54:34 <Camail> needy, as in high maintenance and demanding?
00:54:40 <Camail> I'm sure there's a word for it, dunno tho
00:56:35 <motbob> "You're hopeless" delivered in a loving voice is close

01:41:07 <Micen_> i just had some
01:41:13 <Camail> provided you dont have shitty topping that refrigerate poorly
01:41:31 <Micen_> except Little Ceasers. That is always better the next day
02:11:00 <ZK> pizza.

21:20:41 <Zounds> You should hear how a swede pronounces words with sk in them like sked (spoon)
21:20:44 <Zounds> it will blow your mind

21:24:09 <skram> you didnt like it
21:24:13 <skram> you say nuuu
21:24:17 <Zounds> But why don't americans pronounce the h in the word herb
21:24:22 <Zounds> that bothers me the most
21:24:25 <skram> haha
21:24:27 <skram> √∏√∏√∏√∏rb
21:24:51 <skram> its where we go to buy cigarettes, zounds
