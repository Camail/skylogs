02:19:40 <DuB`> Fun times.
02:27:43 <Camail> all this osu hate, and a ton of people trying to rationalize it with some sort of universilizable rule set
02:27:56 <Camail> a ruleset for a fucking random canvas where everyone can do anything
02:28:49 <skram> what a bunch of nerds
02:35:49 <Bio> very nerd
02:42:52 <skram> im gonna try the sleep
03:12:51 <motbob> in the end it's a democracy
03:13:07 <motbob> so if the majority is justifying their osu hate with a shitty reason, who cares
03:14:57 <motbob> but wow, /r/place really shaped up into something great
03:24:25 <motbob> in fact it's literally the essence of a democracy
03:24:45 <motbob> with the issues that pop up in political decision-making: concentrated vs general interests
03:24:58 <motbob> it's probably in the general interest to nuke the prequelmemes box but gl
03:25:12 <motbob> there is a sizable group that cares a lot about defending it
03:25:35 <motbob> nationality plays a part in whether something will be vigerously defended as well
04:24:18 <Camail> The Undertaker is finally done :(
04:44:59 <Micen> I know Cam :(

19:01:21 <skram> license plates with pictures on them! how vulgar.
19:01:43 <DuB`> Current ones are like this: http://www.theus50.com/images/state-licenses/utah-license.jpg

19:03:54 <skram> oh thats pretty cool
19:04:04 <DuB`> "Angel's Landing"
19:05:33 <skram> Are you not scared of heights?
19:05:49 <DuB`> It was a bit spoopy. >_>
19:05:53 <DuB`> But I like heights.
19:06:00 <DuB`> Also a nice hike, The Narrows: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0f/a1/34/0fa13444123bbac5153f62625903f255.jpg

19:07:27 <DuB`> Bryce Canyon is straight-up alien.
19:09:38 <skram> so you have mountains and snowy places and pine trees and stuff but also deserts
19:09:41 <skram> thats SO WEIRD

19:10:02 <DuB`> YEAH
19:10:04 <skram> Hey Bjørn
19:10:07 <skram> Hey Moocen
19:10:09 <DuB`> Utah is the best!
19:10:27 <skram> I've never been to a desert DuB`
19:10:31 <DuB`> :o
19:10:35 <DoT|Phone1> except mormon
19:10:35 <skram> I would probably get heatstroke and die
19:11:02 <DuB`> It's lovely weather in the spring. :D
19:12:16 <DuB`> The entire southern 2/3 of utah doesn't have cities with more than a few thousand people, just a ton of NATURE.
19:12:47 <skram> nature is RADICAL
19:13:01 <DuB`> Little Sahara: http://www.duneguide.com/images/LittleSahara-1.jpg
19:13:09 <DuB`> Went camping there, was fun.
19:13:21 <DuB`> Made an enormous campfire with tumbleweed. 
19:15:12 <skram> neat
19:16:15 <skram> america is weird, DuB`.
19:16:20 <skram> The weirdest, probably.
19:16:43 <DuB`> :o
19:18:45 <DuB`> !?
19:19:04 <Dot`> Dub
19:19:05 <Dot`> ?
19:19:11 <skram> there are many things
19:19:24 <skram> i can go just about anywhere here and it all looks vaguely the same
19:19:45 <Dot`> america is pretty big
19:19:48 <Dot`> norwat isnt
19:19:55 <Dot`> norway*
19:19:58 <DuB`> A bit.
19:21:52 <DuB`> If any of us every become fabulously wealthy someday, that person will need to sponsor a TLP USA national parks tour.
19:21:53 <DuB`> Heheh
19:22:51 <skram> we can go to moab and do the 4wheeling thing down there
19:24:07 <DuB`> Ooooooooooh
19:24:09 <DuB`> Yah
19:24:15 <DuB`> My favorite is river rafting.

19:24:39 <DuB`> HMM
19:25:08 <Dot`> dub, i miss mountains :(
19:25:12 <DuB`> :(
19:28:57 <DuB`> Maybe I can send you some in another letter.
19:30:18 <DuB`> skram, you ever ski?
19:30:31 <skram> Not really :p
19:30:38 <DuB`> Nuu
19:30:46 <DuB`> Skiing is the ACTUAL best.
19:30:47 <skram> Well I do cross country, but not downhill
19:30:54 <DuB`> Aha
19:31:11 <skram> There's a track by my house that I use sometimes

20:27:39 <Zounds> I enjoyed myself a lot when I visited the US a couple of times but I've never really much of anything except the tourist places in florida
20:27:46 <Zounds> Super mega hyped to visit texas next year though
20:27:49 <Dot`> Hey zounds, cane

20:29:51 <Zounds> and I said sea world twice
20:30:05 <skram> is it because you went there twice
20:30:35 <Zounds> The space centre though, that place is fuckin' big
20:30:51 <Zounds> Especially when you're used to Scotland where nothing is big except the hills
20:32:28 <skram> I think I wanna go to scotland one day
20:32:32 <skram> maybe visit islay
20:32:38 <Zounds> You should, it's not far away
20:32:40 <Zounds> Probably quite cheap too
