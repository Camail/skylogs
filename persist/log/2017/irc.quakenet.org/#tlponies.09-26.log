08:46:52 <Dot`> you got the LED to blink? good job
08:47:55 <Camail> the only reason i could stomach doing it for so long is that no single problem took too long
08:51:47 <Dot`> whats the code
08:58:26 <Camail> had to make a calculator app on android

09:03:08 <reification> > make the entire gui programattically
09:03:14 <reification> too early for this shit
09:03:40 <Camail> we had some boilerplate code he gave us but still took more time than i'd want
09:04:16 <reification> hey dotties
09:04:22 <Camail> we are forbidden from using an xml file to make the gui...literally everything has to be defined through java code
09:04:32 <Camail> is dumb
09:04:50 <Camail> bitch let me drag and drop buttons in a mock up screen

09:22:44 <Rawr|Fone> Very rude
09:30:22 <Rawr|Fone> üê¥üê¥üê¥
09:56:58 <Dot`> well this is nice
09:57:00 <Dot`> Eleven countries are planting a wall of trees from east to west across Africa, just under the southern edge of the Sahara desert.
09:57:00 <Dot`> The goal is to fight the effects of climate change by reversing desertification.
10:00:01 <reification> lots of desert land is reclaimable if africa can get some orgainised action
10:00:06 <reification> IF
10:00:26 <Dot`> well its apparently been going since 2007 and is workin well
10:01:08 <Dot`> using acacia trees that need practicly no water
10:01:58 <reification> sounds good
10:02:25 <Dot`> it is nice to hear something form the centre of africa that isnt about massacres and warlords
10:04:56 <reification> also tree planting like that is the best choice for dampening climate change
10:08:53 <reification> looking at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Green_Wall
10:09:46 <reification> afraid i don‚Äôt see much evidenced action, too much ‚Äúdevelopment of a Harmonized regional strategy for implementation‚Äù
10:13:34 <Dot`> "the African Union Commissioner in charge of the plan, said 15 per cent of the trees were planted already, largely in Senegal and Burkina Faso."
10:13:47 <Dot`> so SOME countries are making progress
10:14:02 <Dot`> as normal the rest are probably funniling the money into corruption
10:14:50 <Dot`> that was a report from 2016

10:14:53 <reification> well it looks like a tricky thing to do given china‚Äôs experience https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-North_Shelter_Forest_Program
10:16:58 <Dot`> well at least in africa the tree planting is actually causign there to be MORE water 
10:17:22 <Dot`> because of the shade less evaporation is occuring and acacias use so little
10:17:48 <reification> that does make things a lot more straightforward
10:19:03 <reification> not so surprised senegal appears in that quote tho
10:20:13 <Dot`> i dont know much about Senegal, but it is a coastal country and seems to be doing ok
10:20:42 <Dot`> HAHAHA
10:21:11 <Dot`> i ggogle Senegal and 4th item is a gov.uk site 
10:21:15 <Dot`>  Latest travel advice for Senegal including safety and security, entry requirements, travel warnings and health.
10:21:36 <Dot`> of course the UK has a saftey section
10:21:45 <Dot`> for EVERY country when visiting
10:22:32 <reification> yep, better follow FCO advice if you like your travel insurance being valid
10:22:42 <Dot`> this is amazing, there is a whole write up on where its safe and not safe
10:23:04 <Dot`> South africa is like, "Good luck, its probably safer over there than here"
10:24:42 <reification> well first line is ‚ÄúThere is a very high level of crime including rape and murder in South Africa.‚Äú

17:45:36 <Cane> Dot`, it ended with me having semi-buggy followers again, but at least they'll still shoot at things.
17:45:54 <Cane> So I stopped in the Dead City and am gonna pick it back up today in about 30 minutes.
17:46:04 <Dot`> you mean your followers turned out to be half cockroaches?
17:46:06 <Dot`> cool
17:47:34 <ZK> just finished sleeping dogs for a secon time. Really liked that game.
17:48:39 <Dot`> isnt there a second one coming out?
