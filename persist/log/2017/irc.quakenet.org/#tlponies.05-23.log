02:06:30 <Bio> Camail u don
02:06:31 <Bio> ?
02:08:40 <Camail> for now
02:09:24 <Camail> got 3 hearts not bad, gonna go east and find a fresh cave system and try again later
02:09:48 <Bio> gotcha
02:10:09 <Bio> I went the other way from you and found a few hearts as well
02:10:15 <Bio> and a cloud in a bottle
02:12:16 <Camail> once i get a grappling hook and a cloud in a bottle things should be a lot easier
02:12:35 <Camail> then we can farm the EoC
02:12:42 <Camail> and get all the tier 2 stuff EZ
02:14:32 <Camail> farming bosses with a team is like exponentially easier than solo
02:21:49 <Camail> getting to 400 health is a pretty high priority, then you're good
02:22:20 <Camail> eventually in hardmode you get to forage in the underground jungle for the last bit of health
02:22:25 <Camail> such fun...
02:23:48 <Bio> gotcha
02:23:55 <Bio> i'm just running around
02:25:04 <Bio> slapping slimes with my zombie arm

09:36:47 <Zounds> hey
09:36:50 <Dot`> zoonds!
09:37:07 <Micen> Hallo Zounds
09:37:48 <Zounds> o/
09:38:59 <Zounds> so manchester got exploded
09:39:55 <Dot`> i saw :/
09:44:10 <Zounds> I get briefed constantly about this stuff at my work but you never really expect it to happen at each event
09:44:34 <Zounds> can't let your guard down at all these days
09:45:51 <Micen> Thats why a part of me is happy to be the weirdo introvert who doesn't go out or do things
09:46:26 <Zounds> I'm one of those guys too
09:46:35 <Zounds> unfortunately I also work in event security D:
09:46:49 <Zounds> So I'm a weirdo introvert who has been to a million festivals and concernts
09:46:52 <Zounds> concerts*
09:47:40 <Micen> you work any WWE?
09:48:06 <Micen> But I do not envy that job in this day and age. 
09:48:11 <Zounds> Once actually when they went to the Hydro in Glasgow
09:49:22 <Zounds> assuming by WWE you mean the wrestlers xD
09:49:37 <Micen> Your euro wrestling fans are a crazy bunch.  
09:49:47 <Micen> and yes. I'm not talking about pandas
09:50:02 <Zounds> I think that's pretty true for wrestling fans around the globe
09:50:19 <Micen> dumb World Wildlife Foundation suing because people might get the brands confused. 
09:50:35 <Zounds> Wrestling is fun though, I have to admit
09:51:51 <Micen> In order of crazy fans its England, Japan, most the rest of Europe, midwest america, east America, the rest of europe, the rest of the world, west coast america
09:52:22 <Micen> Brits love seeing big sweaty men and women duke it out in fake battles. 
09:52:46 <Zounds> Who doesn't
09:53:14 <Micen> "cultured" people. 
09:54:39 <Zounds> fuck 'em
10:14:45 <Dot`> trump has the best words
10:14:47 <Dot`> US President Donald Trump has called those behind the Manchester suicide bombing and other similar attacks "evil losers in life".
10:15:23 <Micen> Dont you want the D?
10:15:40 <Micen> He's quotable. Please take him
10:15:48 <Micen> America gives this gift to the brits.

10:27:24 <Zounds> Well he isn't wrong dot
10:27:55 <Dot`> its a great sacrifice on thier side zounds
10:31:18 <Zounds> i'm inclined to agree with trumps assesment
10:34:02 <Zounds> no need to mince words with those shitters
10:36:18 <Zounds> You can give a grave message of compassion and caring and then do nothing
10:36:24 <Zounds> or give a quick quip then do nothing
10:36:28 <Zounds> end results the same

12:22:17 <reification> yep that‚Äôs what i was thinking
12:22:23 <Dot`> no cover bonuses
12:22:47 <reification> then at least i can land long range shots in dnd if not in pubg
12:22:48 <Dot`> once skram gets the eagle vision you can go be true sniper team, spotter and shooter
12:30:55 <Phearlock> Despite really wanting to get +2 wis, I think advantage on concentration rolls is probably smarter for me.
