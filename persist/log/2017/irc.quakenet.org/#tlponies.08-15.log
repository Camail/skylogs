18:03:38 <Dot`> so expensive but you can get him
18:03:54 <skram> pssh
18:03:57 <Camail> thats what i meant by the paywall, but yea
18:03:58 <Camail> expected
18:04:02 <Camail> did ramses go down to 10k
18:04:06 <skram> thats only like 20 hours of gaming
18:04:08 <skram> maybe a bit more
18:04:12 <skram> maybe a lot more
18:04:17 <Dot`> ah, i thought you meant actual money ruby things
18:04:47 <Camail> I'm up to 6k again
18:04:55 <Camail> dunno if i even want to buy another hero
18:05:08 <Dot`> i also have pakko on rotation, so will try him when we play
18:05:11 <Camail> i dont want to buy voden because run likes him, and i think you should try him maybe
18:05:35 <Dot`> i tihnk i could enjoy voden
18:08:32 <Camail> oh god last night i had a team where the ramses, on a team with all melee on reef, sprinted to the middle and sat there
18:08:36 <Camail> it was a bad game
18:08:52 <Zounds> If we stack gigantic lemme know
18:09:04 <Camail> no i will keep it secret
18:09:06 <Camail> secret stack
18:09:09 <Camail> no zounds allowed
18:09:20 <Runbunny> very quiet stack
18:09:26 <skram> lets make our own stack zounds
18:09:33 <skram> with blackjack and hookers
18:09:52 <Zounds> Yes
18:09:54 <Camail> OH, but i figured out a really good strat on reef, you attack f, and when they are running from e, you back up into that hallways conencting c and f
18:10:07 <Camail> then you have a close ranged fight where their engagement is terrible
18:10:13 <Camail> it works really well vs a team with a sniper
18:10:34 <Camail> your ranged can sit behind the c rock and they have tog et up close
18:11:16 <Zounds> Yeah i've seen that happen a few times naturally
18:11:34 <Camail> thats where i got the idea, and it just seems to always go in the attackers favor
18:11:58 <Zounds> I'm sure we'll find a way to change that
18:14:07 <Camail> in general i am thinking about timing an attack, then engaging right before they get to you
18:14:19 <Camail> you dont want to dive a 100% health active creature
18:14:28 <Camail> there isnt enough time to kill it unless you dump focus
18:14:40 <Zounds> I got the shadow cerberus btw
18:14:49 <DuB`> https://i.imgur.com/T39Hk4h.gifv
18:15:33 <Camail> thats useful
18:15:36 <Camail> that fucker is hard to kill
18:15:42 <Camail> both lvl 2 scouts are
18:15:46 <Camail> they mvoe around so god damned much
18:15:53 <Zounds> yeah the shadow cerberus in particular
18:16:00 <Camail> also
18:16:01 <Zounds> he's immune while doing his blink strikes I believe
18:16:04 <Camail> you can hide underneath it while healing
18:16:07 <Camail> which is INSANE
18:17:01 <Camail> having on siren's point D is nice
18:18:16 <Zounds> Takes 2 focus to evolve him compared to the regular cerberus
18:18:24 <Zounds> I'll have to keep that in mind
18:18:45 <Dot`> i have 11k currently
18:18:57 <Dot`> i think before i buy a hero i will get one of the point things
18:19:06 <skram> buy one you hate
18:19:07 <Dot`> no decision yet though
18:19:16 <Dot`> the skram tactic
18:20:47 <DuB`> Get tripp skins.
18:20:50 <DuB`> Or a DRAGON!
18:21:12 <DuB`> I wanna OW or pubgame today~
18:21:45 <Dot`> does a dragon use 3 focus to get? because i can do that most games then :P
18:21:56 <Zounds> One of them does but they're rubbish
18:22:42 <Dot`> thats sad zounds
18:22:46 <DuB`> Oh? :o
18:22:47 <DuB`> Drat.
18:24:17 <Zounds> New guy seems interesting
18:24:21 <Zounds> I'll try him out if we play later
18:27:55 <Dot`> https://www.twitch.tv/starcraft
18:28:08 <Dot`> snute vs demu
18:31:13 <Dot`> snuta!
18:34:46 <Camail> Dot`  if you wanted to you can move your hollow knight save to the steam folder
18:34:51 <Camail> thats what i did way back then
18:36:19 <Dot`> nah, im working back through it, a lot is going far quicker and its a nce refresher
18:36:42 <Camail> yea i figured, just wanted to point out that it works
18:36:45 <Dot`> but i am really confused how i fell to the spider place early on last time
18:36:50 <Bio> got 89% done so far
18:36:55 <Camail> there's like 3 entrances
18:36:57 <Bio> big bit left
18:37:12 <Dot`> i have been thorugh the city, the kngdom edge, the waterworks and the place under there, and the resting grounds already
18:37:51 <Dot`> last time while wondering around the greenpath or jellyfish land i fell in a large hole
18:38:03 <Bio> that happens
18:38:03 <Dot`> before i even had my first nail upgrade
18:38:20 <Dot`> now i have looked and cant find that way in
18:38:42 <DuB`> I NA oberwaj now~
18:38:47 <Dot`> gl dub
18:38:50 <Bio> dub pls
18:38:54 <Camail> yea dot its in the fungal wastes
18:39:18 <Camail> i believe you can just fall in
18:39:34 <Camail> its not somewhere you wanna be early game
18:39:54 <Dot`> yea, you go along a low passage which leads to a temple or something and the ground falls away
18:40:05 <Dot`> and i fell, and it was awefull
18:40:06 <Dot`> haha
18:40:19 <Camail> the burrowing bugs are very annoying if you cant kill them quick
18:40:28 <Bio> thats the only thing I didn't like about the game. All the random suprise pits into spikes
18:40:45 <Dot`> fun times bio
18:40:57 <Bio> mostly in spider hell hole
18:41:10 <Camail> that entire area is about surprise attacks
18:41:19 <Dot`> StarCraft Remastered Launch Event
18:41:19 <Dot`> Day 2   19m
18:41:24 <Bio> Oh, and they nailed that asthetic
18:41:32 <Bio> I don't have to like it xD
18:41:46 <Camail> yea its rough
18:42:08 <Camail> bio the worst part is the glitch that a certain pit trap was bugged to respawn you out of world
18:42:12 <Camail> yea i hit that one
18:42:27 <Dot`> lol, was that the bug i had to grab the update for
18:42:29 <Camail> and had to revert a lot of progress
18:42:36 <Camail> one of the bugs
18:42:48 <Camail> that and not getting any arena rewards
18:42:54 <Dot`> ouch
18:43:01 <Bio> fun. one time i got knocked into a wall and was floating around in places
18:43:08 <Dot`> spooky
18:43:11 <Bio> exit to screen fixed it
18:43:12 <Camail> i had to download a hack to reset the first arena
18:43:38 <Camail> wasnt an issue though because i had the final nail
18:43:42 <Camail> which has a siiiiiick design
18:43:47 <Bio> first 2 arenas worked for me, still struggling on arena 3
18:44:00 <Camail> the trial of the fool was my final 1%
18:44:03 <Bio> thou now i have more badges and all the upgrades
18:44:09 <Camail> i only did it to complete the bestiary
18:44:19 <Camail> its just long, really
18:44:39 <Bio> yeh, i'll give it a try again
18:44:58 <Camail> the badge that gives you quick healing is useful
18:49:32 <Camail> charm*

19:58:02 <Camail> Zounds  at the end the ramses walked up to our active hero because we were 80/80
19:58:07 <Camail> and sitracted him for 1 second
19:58:10 <Camail> didnt engage, just walked up

19:58:40 <Zounds> Yeh
19:58:54 <Camail> zounds we need to play with new players again
19:58:59 <Camail> i prefer when enemies know nothing
19:59:02 <Zounds> I couldn't hit anything in melee range to be honest
19:59:17 <Camail> lag or misses?
19:59:22 <Zounds> lag I hope
19:59:26 <Camail> cuz knossus is opssible the most damaging hero
19:59:42 <Zounds> Just seemed to whiff everything
20:00:09 <Camail> arbitersssss
20:00:27 <Zounds> I like to wreck face as knossos but it wasn't happening that time
20:00:38 <Zounds> I seem to lag a lot in this game but no other
20:00:40 <Camail> i evne built for you
20:00:44 <Camail> with my damage buff
20:00:46 <Camail> T_T

20:20:52 <Camail> well we also crushed them
20:21:05 <Camail> our team fights were way better
20:21:18 <Camail> becaues they have vadasi + xenobia = no damage
20:21:23 <Camail> those games are autolose
20:21:29 <Zounds> True true
20:21:44 <Zounds> I managed to snipe the enemy gaurdian to finish the game there at the end
20:21:57 <Zounds> his ultimates execute thingy also applies to enemy guardians it seems
20:22:09 <Camail> we were gonna get it, i dove with full health at the end
20:22:15 <Camail> its so hard to stop a 5v5 in the last wound
