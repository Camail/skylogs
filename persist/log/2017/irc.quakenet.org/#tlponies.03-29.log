00:01:09 <Dot`> but as niether happned your a brave hero
00:01:24 <Dot`> and not an idiot who stepped into traffic
00:09:50 <Dot`> is it not a thing in america for people to treat a broken traffic light like a stop street?
00:10:11 <Micen> snela dot
00:10:12 <Dot`> and go 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, becuase there is always an idiot
00:10:20 <Micen> you act like Americans know how to drive
00:10:32 <Dot`> even south africans managed that
00:10:41 <Dot`> except taxis
00:10:52 <Dot`> which are not what you think of when you think taxis

09:39:50 <Runbunny> I stayed in bed for too long.
09:39:54 <Runbunny> so I am a bit tired.
09:40:12 <DoT|Phone1> hi Runbun
09:40:17 <Runbunny> Hello Dot.
09:40:22 <Runbunny> Look at the picture.
09:41:06 <DoT|Phone1> thanks Run
09:46:42 <Runbunny> How are you Rawr?
09:46:58 <Rawr|Phone> Great!
09:48:05 <Runbunny> DoT|Phone1, http://i.imgur.com/8IZ932X.png
09:48:09 <Runbunny> That's good!
09:48:49 <DoT|Phone1> haha
09:49:01 <Cane> Fuck, I was just about to post that.
09:49:03 <Cane> Beaten by 1 minute Runbunny.
09:49:25 <DoT|Phone1> hi cane
09:49:28 <Cane> Hiya. <3
09:49:42 <Runbunny> :D
09:49:44 <Runbunny> Hai Cane.
10:03:14 <Cane> DoT|Phone1, ArmSTALKER mod got an update. No servers for us, no content we can partake in yet, but at least it's being updated and worked on. <3
10:03:50 <Cane> I checked out the ingame content in the arsenal and editor.
10:03:57 <Cane> It's buggy as shit, lot of missing models and crud.
10:04:07 <Cane> One weapon had a sound so quiet you could hardly hear it.
10:04:20 <Cane> But they have a bunch of weapons and items at least.
10:04:55 <Cane> I saw a lot of weapons from STCoP too.
10:05:00 <Cane> The VSSK is there.
10:05:15 <Cane> Gauss Rifle is hilariously overpowered.
10:05:29 <Cane> PEW, it goes, and then everything you pointed it at is now dead.
10:05:43 <Cane> Pretty sure it can destroy helicopters in like 2-3 shots.
10:08:06 <Rawr|Phone> Seems fair
10:19:43 <DoT|Phone1> haha
10:20:13 <DoT|Phone1> Well that is how strong it is. And you get like 10 shots with it the whole game
10:23:38 <DoT|Phone1> but I don't think it should bee in really. it's just going to lead to the top players being unstoppable
10:26:01 <DoT|Phone1> is the seva suit as amazing as it was?
10:32:49 <Cane> Oh you can get way more than 10 shots with it. In fact I remember a mission where... what's his face, the mechanic in the shipwreck?
10:33:02 <Cane> I think it's him. Anyway, you get him schematics, and he learns to make batteries for it, so you can buy Gauss Rifle ammo from that dude.
10:33:17 <Cane> I don't think there's a single game where you have fininte Gauss Rifle ammo. It's just very rare.
10:33:26 <DoT|Phone1> oh lol
10:33:44 <Cane> It's pretty brokenly good as a weapon, but it is the very last thing you get usually.
10:34:02 <DoT|Phone1> I would normally use a clip then Chuck it because I liked the vss :P
10:35:13 -!- Golly [~Golly@1.92-221-121.customer.lyse.net] has joined #tlponies
10:41:14 <Cane> Yeah same, the VSS is so good in those games.
10:42:49 <DoT|Phone1> I always found also I was limited in amount of guns to carry
10:42:57 <DoT|Phone1> due to ammo weight
10:43:11 <DoT|Phone1> so you pick like 2 guns
10:43:26 <DoT|Phone1> And the vss is so versatile
10:50:34 <Cane> Yeah, I usually had the VSS and either a low weight shotgun or a pistol.
10:50:50 <Cane> It can pretty much do anything as long as you have the ammo for it.
10:50:56 <Cane> And once you start meeting Monolith you get a fair bit of 9x39mm.

22:40:59 <Zounds> goodnight horselords
22:55:29 <motbob> i don't want to be a horselord
22:55:43 <Micen_> too late 
23:00:57 <Micen_> .tag motbob horselord
23:01:39 <motbob> we're in an era where the freedom to choose one's own identity is held in higher esteem than practically any other right
23:02:18 <motbob> to the extent that persons can, although not uncontroversially, choose to spit in nature's face if nature doesn't cooperate
23:02:38 <motbob> and so I have to feel like it's a human rights violation for you to tag me with horselord
23:02:45 * Micen_ is one of said people
23:02:46 <motbob> plz
23:03:17 <Micen_> It is my perception of you. a lord among horses. 
23:03:20 <motbob> where's the untag option
23:03:21 <Micen_> it is high honor
23:03:29 <Micen_> ?tag
23:03:30 <motbob> .untag motbob horselord
23:03:47 <Micen_> .tag Micen Horselord
23:04:13 <Micen_> Horselord could be an interesting comic book hero. 
23:04:30 <Micen_> whos mask is just one of those rubber horse masks that pop up at conventions
23:05:04 <Micen_> because seeing a crime fighter in https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Horse-Head-Mask-Creepy-Halloween-Costume-Theater-Prop-Novelty-Latex-Rubber/32592259665.html?source=%7Bifdyn:dyn%7D%7Bifpla:pla%7D%7Bifdbm:DBM&albch=DID%7D&src=google&albch=shopping&acnt=708-803-3821&isdl=y&aff_short_key=UneMJZVf&albcp=653153647&albag=34728528644&slnk=&trgt=57344828050&plac=&crea=en32592259665&netw=g&device=c&mtctp=&gclid=Cj0KEQjwtu3GBRDY6ZLY1e
