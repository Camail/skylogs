17:56:50 <DuB`> Going home for mothers day weekend, gonna do some pre-florida shopping.
17:57:08 <DuB`> Dot I am terrified of large carnivores WHAT IF I SEE AN ALLIGATOR.
17:57:15 <DuB`> ALLIGATORS ARE THE WORST.
17:57:49 <Dot`> well dub, as an african i can tell you a trick
17:57:57 <DuB`> oke
17:58:06 <Dot`> dont walk up and try hit it or feed it
17:58:33 <Dot`> its amazing how many people get that wrong
17:58:38 <DuB`> O_o
17:58:57 <DuB`> Was already planning on fleeing for my life upon sighting one.
17:59:00 <DuB`> THEY EAT PEOPLE
17:59:11 <Dot`> also dont try pet them
17:59:17 <DuB`> nopenopenope
17:59:22 <Dot`> people eat people
18:02:10 <DuB`> Not often.
18:02:54 <Dot`> probably more than alligators
18:03:08 <DuB`> No, alligators eat people ALL THE TIME
18:03:12 <DuB`> It's their JOB
18:03:15 <DuB`> Awful creatures.
18:03:51 <Dot`> shame, they are no crocodiles ill agree, but they arnt THAT bad
18:04:36 <DuB`> Being killed by carnivorous animals is probably my greatest fear.
18:04:43 <DuB`> Alligators, wolves, sharks...
18:04:44 <DuB`> Yuck.
18:05:10 <Dot`> dub, drowning is far worse
18:05:13 <DuB`> I fully support the creation of sharkfin soup and alligator hide bags.
18:05:29 <DuB`> An alligator will drown you AND eat you!

18:08:51 <Dot`> they have many teeth though
18:08:56 <DuB`> ... yes.
18:09:15 <DuB`> So if I go swimming I should do everything I can to not look like a seal.

18:19:20 <DuB`> I thought so.
18:20:59 <DoT|Phone2> alligators seem to kill less than one person a year. and it's old and really young
18:22:28 <Rawr|Fone> You are safe until you get older dub

18:29:37 <DoT|Phone2> well crocodiles jaw muscles are good at closing. but little strength to open.
18:29:38 <DuB`> Looking for tips.
18:29:49 <DuB`> Ah, yes.
18:29:50 <DoT|Phone2> so a the band can keep out closed
18:29:51 <DuB`> But dot!
18:30:14 <DuB`> To apply that I would need to approach them, which contradicts Tip #1.
18:30:27 <Camail> dont go to swamps
18:30:37 <Camail> drive everywhere
18:30:45 <DoT|Phone2> well dub. this is the backup plan
18:30:59 <DuB`> I see.
18:31:02 <Camail> own a big gun and yell when you are near water to scare them away
18:31:15 <DuB`> I could buy a gun.
18:31:23 <DuB`> I'm sure they have extras in FLORIDA.
18:31:24 <Camail> also make dot beat the bug game

18:38:50 <DuB`> For my preference destination.
18:39:49 <Camail> hmmm
18:39:56 <Camail> it depends on how much you like rollercoasters
18:40:19 <Camail> because universal has some siiiiiiiiick rollercoasters 
18:43:16 <DuB`> Rollercoasters are nice, but I don't think I'd pick them over other things.
18:43:23 <DuB`> Not a primary attraction for me.

21:22:40 <Dot`> phear <3
21:27:23 <DuB`off> <jamesl> if I look at my laptop screen angled downwards it looks blue. If I look at it angled upwards it looks red. Why is this?
21:27:24 <DuB`off> <jamesl> it only recently started
21:27:24 <DuB`off> <Kalium> jamesl: are you closing and opening it at a really, really high speed?
21:27:36 <DuB`off> This xkcdb bit makes me laugh every time.
21:27:42 <Phearlock> lol
21:28:01 <Phearlock> I don't remember that one. pretty good =D

21:57:59 <DuB`> dot
21:58:17 <DuB`> I think I gym now.
22:03:25 <Dot`> gl!
23:10:14 <Dot`> pon pon
23:13:17 <Crisium> pon
23:17:44 <Dot`> how sit going Crisium
23:20:28 <Crisium> doing some scrub OWing
23:20:52 <Crisium> when you pick rein for once, and then realize why you dont play him, its because no one bothers to shoot from behind your shield
23:27:32 <Dot`> yip
23:27:34 <Dot`> the pain
23:30:10 <DuB`> am
23:30:10 <DuB`> ded
23:30:11 <DuB`> :D
23:33:58 <Dot`> tis a shame
23:34:27 <DuB`> Drinking this little protein shake right after that is just making me feel sick.
23:34:36 <DuB`> Too thick/heavy/rich/whatever. :T
23:35:22 <Dot`> then dont drink it
23:35:32 <DuB`> But PROTEIN
23:35:55 <Dot`> drinks are useless
23:36:10 <DuB`> !?
23:40:40 <Camail> eat something with protein
23:40:58 <Camail> like a bar, or a piece of raw meat
23:41:04 <Camail> or cooked, if you are weak
23:41:22 <Camail> protein drinks are the worst
23:43:45 <DuB`> Or I could just play DOOM.
23:43:51 <DuB`> The ACTUAL most manly thing.
23:44:03 <Camail> but
23:44:04 <Camail> gainz
23:44:49 <Dot`> talk to saura of gains when he next shows up
23:46:22 <DuB`> Who needs raw meat when I can Rip & Tear!
23:47:29 <Camail> that's what you do to meat with your teeth
23:49:18 <Camail> so i tried playing witcher 3 again and had 0 idea what to do
23:49:46 <Camail> think i might even finish the first dlc
23:49:57 <Camail> death march is boring as fuck tho so i turned down the difficulty
23:50:11 <Camail> ng+ death march is possibly the least fun way to play witcher 3
