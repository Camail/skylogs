01:49:40 <Dot`> why you leave
01:49:55 <BioSC> school silly
01:51:23 <Dot`> i was watching pony and wanted a pon to watch with
01:51:51 <BioSC> I'm always with u 
01:52:06 <BioSC> thru the magic of frindship
01:56:00 <Dot`> <3
01:59:06 <DuB`> Wuh
01:59:55 <BioSC> dub
01:59:56 <BioSC> pls
02:00:36 <BioSC> plzzzzzzzz
02:13:04 <Camail> dub go to sleep
02:14:25 <BioSC> should i look up the ending to orc game cam
02:14:36 <Camail> i probably will
02:15:16 <BioSC> 3 endings, looking like mass effect syndrome
02:29:57 <Camail> the fact that they front loaded the story is so dumb
02:30:13 <Camail> i dunno, honestly like this game has all the pieces to be great
02:30:18 <Camail> but they failed so hard putting it together
02:30:21 <BioSC> yeh
02:30:26 <Camail> there is no single cohesive design
02:30:55 <BioSC> I'm not sure if I really like the twist or if the story stuff made me like it less overall
02:30:56 <BioSC> idk
02:31:13 <Camail> i really like the twist, i thought it was bad ass
02:31:18 <Camail> but like..it doesnt matter
02:31:35 <Camail> the twist itself is cool but everything around it is vanilla
02:33:20 <Camail> and i honestly, honestly believe a lot of the choices made in the game were to appeal to the audience that buys loot boxes
02:33:58 <Camail> like, act 4 is literally just a shitty mobile game structure
02:34:21 <Camail> act 3 isn't even an act its a fucking game ending
02:34:34 <Camail> and act 2 has a bunch of quests but no satisfying ending
02:34:40 <Camail> this studio cant fucking write an ending
02:34:54 <Camail> fire all of your fucking writers you made two AAA games with terrible end games
02:40:58 <Camail> BioSC I JUST LOOKED UP THE ENDING IT FUCKING SUCKS
02:41:02 <Camail> FUCK
02:41:08 <BioSC> lel
02:41:26 <BioSC> its like
02:41:28 <BioSC> well, yeah
02:41:47 <BioSC> you do wat talion did and that outcome is pretty much 100% gonna happen
02:41:59 <BioSC> but then the last like 3 mins
02:42:01 <BioSC> rofl
02:43:13 <Camail> its literally just the same ending but a bit longer!
02:43:20 <Camail> fucking....fuck ea
02:43:26 <Camail> glad i didnt pay them for this
02:44:17 <Camail> uninstalled, deleted, it was fun
02:44:28 <Camail> i didnt play a single siege and i am happier for it
02:44:59 <BioSC> eh, attacking and defending aren't even hard
02:45:35 <Camail> also SPOILERS DONT READ IF YOU CARE talion didnt even get his own unique mask
02:45:54 <Camail> what kind of half assed rushed bullshit ending turns him into a generic ring wraith
02:46:30 <BioSC> its like they couldn't choose whether to be lore faithful or not and decided to do both
02:46:51 <Camail> i would be so much more pissed if i spent 20 more hours grinding for the ending
02:46:55 <Camail> and I am already very mad
02:47:14 <Camail> i knew is houldn't have trusted a game company that gave us the worst ending of a game in history
02:47:42 <Camail> they are the ass fucks who eat the entire ice cream tub in one night and vomit it up the next day
02:47:58 <Camail> because they cant fucking leave any resources for the end of the game to make the journey worth it
02:53:55 <BioSC> fuckin love icecream tho
02:53:58 <BioSC> =D
02:56:17 <Camail> yea and i love game dev resources
02:56:46 <Camail> this game's ratio was design by marketers
02:57:04 <Camail> people only ever play a game for like 5 hours on average so why waste time on the ending of a game
02:57:24 <Camail> fuck making an actually good product, we just want enough play experience to get the money
03:15:40 <DuB`> MMA just finished his military service~
03:49:14 <Camail> good thing they didnt have any wars
03:49:26 <Camail> there are some people who are just starting their service that are probably super scared
03:49:33 <Camail> because NK is going nutso
