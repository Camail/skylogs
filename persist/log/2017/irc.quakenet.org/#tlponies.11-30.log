22:04:00 <Camail> god i hate pakko 
22:04:03 <Camail> and wu
22:04:07 <Camail> they had to be a premade
22:04:22 <Zounds> I think that's enough for me right now
22:04:33 <Zounds> Decent game but yeah those two just ran through and annhilated me
22:05:12 <Camail> I've never liked pakko's design
22:05:31 <Camail> he can tank all the damage and has so much crowd control
22:05:35 <Camail> its just fucked up
22:05:54 <Camail> that game makes me rage
22:06:00 <Camail> more than any other game i play
22:06:18 <Zounds> Me too kinda

22:06:52 <Zounds> The lag doesn't help much when I queue with USA bros
22:07:01 <Zounds> Getting tounged by Wu puts me through the map
22:07:10 <Zounds> then he's sliding and bouncing around everywhere while I take massive damage :P
22:07:46 <Zounds> I feel like things move faster in Gigantic than they originally intended them to
22:07:51 <Zounds> game would be better if things were slower
22:08:02 <carcinisation> well i just saw a zerg transfuse...  a creep tumor :O
22:08:04 <Camail> i uninstalled, i tried getting back in but its dead in tlp and i am bored of all the archetypes they designed
22:08:25 <Camail> and zandora is th eonly hero i enjoy but she's terrible
22:08:44 <Zounds> Hehe
22:08:46 <Zounds> I might do the same
22:09:04 <Zounds> I don't hate the game but it's a bit crap sometimes
22:10:07 <Camail> i dont hate it, i just derive no joy from playing it
22:10:18 <Camail> I've never had a fun loss
22:10:22 <Camail> they just dont exist
22:11:28 <Zounds> They all look pretty much the same
22:11:40 <Zounds> Can you take D? if not then try poke C
22:11:47 <Zounds> Do they react fast enough? if yes you lose if no you win
22:13:02 <Camail> if you have a griselma or someone who can solo a creature then you can use that
22:13:16 <Camail> but i honestly think you NEED that if you want any hopes of taking back advantage
22:13:24 <Camail> but then if they just have a better hero comp its over anyway
22:13:39 <Camail> the imani forced us off D and from there is was over

22:14:16 <Camail> Wu is so fast that wen cant flank because even if his team is late he can come in during the retreat and gang up on one person
22:14:46 <Camail> forcing us to take a team fight with pakku making it impossible to move
22:15:25 <Camail> and the game fucking tilts me with its shitty MM before the game even starts
22:15:29 <Camail> thats the worst part
22:15:35 <Camail> they cant even get 10 people in a fucking server
22:16:01 <Bio> pone
22:16:03 <Camail> because its a shit company that got canned, and now the game will lay stagnant and die

22:28:13 <Phearlock> no
22:28:40 <micen> I just spent a good twenty minutes arguing with my sisters boyfriends kid about ponies. 
22:29:03 <micen> She was insisting that Twilight was the princess of rudeness and was a nightmare. 
22:29:27 <Phearlock> wtf
22:29:29 <Phearlock> rude
22:29:36 <micen> I know.
22:30:00 <micen> And she doesnt consider the show canon
22:30:36 <micen> only whatever suits her propaganda driven narrative is

22:58:05 <micen> That is objectively wrong. Twilight is the sister-in-law of the best princess, possibly ever, in the history of princesses. Bigly

23:53:03 <skram> what a terrible waste
23:53:11 <micen> i am sharing that birb
23:53:30 <skram> i am fairly certain i would lose my patience with a god damned screaming bird after a very short time
23:53:56 <DuB`> But skram
23:53:58 <DuB`> AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
23:54:00 <DuB`> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
23:54:14 <skram> WHAT
23:54:16 <skram> DO
23:54:17 <skram> YOU
23:54:18 <skram> WANT
23:54:20 <Dot`> all birds do is make a mess and a noise
23:54:21 <skram> AISFDHUS(EGF(ASEGRF(Q#WYF
23:54:34 <skram> thats true for every animal Dot`
23:54:40 <Dot`> even cats
23:54:42 <skram> all dogs do are make noise and ruin shoes
23:54:47 <micen> cats are dumb
23:54:53 <Dot`> but birds are really great at doing those things
23:54:58 <micen> i have never had a dog eat a shoe skram
23:55:01 <micen> never
23:55:07 <Dot`> skram, i feel you havnt really known a dog
23:55:23 <skram> i have actually
23:55:26 <skram> she chewed on slippers
23:55:31 <micen> and ive had at least 12 i can think of off the top of my head 
23:55:51 <micen> I had a dog that was "house trained" we adopted
23:56:16 <micen> first thing he did was come into my living room (which admittedly has a green shag carpet) and took a dump
23:56:43 <skram> good boy
23:57:06 <micen> also he growled at my brother and wouldnt let him in half the house
23:57:37 <skram> ...how long did this go on for?
23:57:45 <micen> two days 
23:57:56 <micen> we relisted him and he went to a loving nonchild home
23:58:05 <Dot`> that soundslike a mistreated dog :/
23:58:16 <Dot`> not by you, but previous owner
23:58:36 <micen> It was from a military family. 
23:59:21 <micen> So either mistreated or used to a much more structured environment without kids and a more clear pack order
