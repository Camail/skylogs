06:06:48 <Bio> zelda doesn't talk
06:07:02 <Camail> but tis the most emoition from that IP ever

06:07:06 <Bio> he only grunts
06:07:10 <Bio> =O
06:07:17 <Camail> oh, thought you were talking about zelda
06:07:24 <Camail> who actually has speaking lines in the trailer
06:07:25 <Camail> link doesnt
06:07:28 <Camail> he might act ually not talk
06:07:30 <Camail> we don't know

06:14:14 <Bio> we'd have to get a wiiu

06:17:08 <Camail> wiiu is dead
06:17:14 <Camail> the switch is coming out in q1
06:21:53 <Phearlock> I can wait a little bit in order to buy a not-dead console
06:26:17 <Camail> i would love to get one, really, but i am de-escalating spending habits after the frenzy of christmas sales
06:26:41 <Camail> i want to support nintendo, but also am annoyed
06:26:49 <Camail> oh also phear EU doesnt have an announced release date yet
06:26:50 <Camail> so lol
06:26:58 <Camail> usa and JP are out on march 3rd
06:27:13 <Camail> but EU is shitty for game developement
06:27:19 <Camail> gotta spend WAY more on localization
06:27:42 <Camail> because you can't actually sell games  or anything without enough languages on the system
06:29:25 <Phearlock> Again, I will just wait
06:29:36 <Phearlock> I can wait a long time

16:26:42 <Runbunny>  was probably like 6
16:26:43 <Runbunny> idk
16:26:59 <Zounds> Are you doing a challenge run of some kind?
16:28:23 <Runbunny> Yeah, I am challenging myself to beat the game with a 2 hander.
16:28:26 <Runbunny> kinda.
16:28:44 <Runbunny> great whatever weapon at least.
16:29:41 <Zounds> Oh that's not too bad
16:29:46 <Zounds> Never swing more than once and you'll be fine
16:30:26 <Runbunny> I am currently using gravelord greatsword. It's running attack is pretty good.
16:34:30 <Zounds> Is that the jumping thing
16:35:03 <Runbunny> You know it.
16:35:20 <Runbunny> Dot Zounds is a dark souls master. You should have him do the no hit run.
16:36:18 <Zounds> I'd last till lower undead burg

16:36:45 <Zounds> And if not them then the flailing lunge from the torch hollows

16:39:47 <Runbunny> dsfix dsfix
16:39:53 <Runbunny> 60 fps.
16:40:02 <Zounds> It doesn't seem to work for me anymore
16:40:22 <Zounds> It does prevent the super low drops from particle effects and stuff but doesn't get me above 30
16:40:30 <Runbunny> Which button do you have it bound to?
16:40:52 <Runbunny> You need to unlock the fps in the .ini files and then there's an ingame button push
16:41:58 <Zounds> Maybe I missed something last time I tried, i'll check again when I play again
