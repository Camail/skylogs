00:06:08 <skram> cam has nip been kinda shit the last year
00:06:31 <Camail> once they dropped friberg they've been improving
00:06:43 <Camail> mainly because rez is really good 
00:06:51 <skram> cool beans
00:06:53 <Camail> rez and draken have bolstered the team
00:07:04 <skram> how has draken been performing
00:07:18 <Camail> but yea nip got fucked for awhile, became a completely irrelevant team
00:07:27 <Camail> but friberg is on optic now
00:07:31 <Camail> and is doing just fine
00:08:09 <skram> i dont know, maybe having basically the same lineup for 6 years can become a disadvantage

02:49:22 <Rawr|Fone> No
02:57:56 <Camail> I've come to realize that when you make the obstacles of a DnD campaign evil, players will always fight them

03:05:52 <Camail> or at the very least, the obstacle must have some apparent non-violent property. If they've been nothing but violent, you can't expect players to search for a non-violent solution

03:06:30 <Camail> ooh, cool idea
03:06:37 <Camail> a group of adventurerers whoa re relief workers

03:08:50 <Camail> there are so many options
03:09:06 <Camail> so many problems to solve, conflicts of interests and morals
