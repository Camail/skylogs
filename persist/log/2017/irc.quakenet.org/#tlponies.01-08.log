03:45:09 <Camail> at changed like 4 outbreaks
03:45:25 <Camail> if that didn't happen then we would've been very very easily in the clear

03:46:27 <Dot`> like we got screwed in the game before
03:46:29 <Dot`> haha

18:55:51 <Phearlock> Dot, we never actually established that bit.
18:56:00 <Phearlock> The backstory didn't really specify

21:11:48 <Runbunny> Dot.
21:11:49 <skram> yeah preventing cancer is a stupid thing to do anders
21:11:57 <Dot`> this shotgun is amazing
21:12:50 <Runbunny> Prevent cancer foundation operates purely out of the US, if you live anywhere else in the world, they don't care about you.
21:24:21 <motbob> bro
21:24:38 <motbob> whereas doctor's without borders is neccesarily local
21:24:54 <motbob> --because they're going to countries and treating people and stuff--
21:25:06 <motbob> the prevent cancer foundation is about PREVENTING CANCER
21:25:18 <motbob> which isn't exactly a localized event
21:25:29 <motbob> it's not like they are preventing AMERICAN CANCER
21:26:01 <motbob> since there is an education aspect to what they do, I guess there is some local aspect to it
22:01:47 <BioWork> asdf
22:02:11 <Runbunny> asdf indeed.
