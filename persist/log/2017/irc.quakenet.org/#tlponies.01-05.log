00:16:57 <Cane> https://www.twitch.tv/overwatch_nge Moar OW games.
00:17:17 <Crisium> e sport
00:17:34 <DuB> Aha!
00:18:07 <DuB> Down with complexity!
00:20:56 <Cane> DuB is such a Complexity fanboy.
00:21:09 <DuB> Wut
00:21:18 <DuB> I want col to lose every game they play. :P
00:21:18 <Crisium> wot
00:21:27 <Cane> lol why
00:21:52 <skram> because dub is gay for mendo
00:21:56 <DuB> TJOs were csgo cheaters, harbleu is a dirty roadhog main, etc.
00:22:00 <DuB> :P
00:22:09 <Crisium> roadhog is dirty
00:22:12 <Crisium> but all teams have him
00:22:27 <skram> truth
00:22:31 <DuB> Harb has ALWAYS played him though.
00:22:31 <BioAFK> is that doug dimmadome? owner of the dimmsdale dimmadome?
00:22:33 <Cane> TJOs?
00:23:02 <DuB> Torktjo and nicholastjo.
00:23:08 * Bio slaps DuB around a bit with a large trout
00:23:17 <Cane> Ah, meh.
00:23:34 <skram> is the csgo cheating thing confirmed or just rumours
00:23:38 <skram> never been clear on that
00:23:39 <DuB> TSM was the first org to pick up this team, and them immediately dropped them 3 days later upon learning their history.
00:23:39 <DuB> lol
00:23:52 <DuB> Col was like, "eh, we'll take 'em!"
00:24:33 <DuB> Also shadowburn is the #1 genji so I'd be fore Faze in this matchup anyway!
00:24:45 <DuB> He's the beeest.
00:24:48 <skram> shadowburn is russian
00:26:51 <Cane> I heard about that.
00:27:00 <Cane> Friend of mine said the same thing yesterday.
00:27:14 <Cane> He kind of stopped playing Genji because of the current tank main though?
00:27:23 <DuB> Yep. :(
00:27:29 <Cane> Sad days.
00:27:30 <DuB> It hurts everyone! This needs to stop!
00:27:33 <DuB> :P
00:27:33 <Cane> WTB not a tank meta.
00:27:40 <skram> he did genji in vegas
00:27:43 <skram> to mediocre result
00:27:43 <Crisium> complexity has 0 roadhog
00:27:45 <Crisium> better team
00:28:08 <skram> i like tank meta more than the other things
00:28:14 <DuB> Shadowburn genji is miles ahead of seagull and surefour, even.
00:28:16 <DuB> Fun to watch.
00:28:28 <skram> seagull is only good on stream
00:28:51 <DuB> He's had some good genji in tournaments, I think.
00:28:54 <DuB> TORK STAHP
00:29:02 <skram> seriously, no stream hero person with 900 youtube videos has ever won a tournament
00:29:31 <Cane> Wouldn't be surprised if he just makes more money this way though.
00:29:34 <DuB> Not gonna argue that NRG isn't bad. :P
00:29:42 <DuB> I just think his genji is fine for pro level.
00:30:02 <skram> Yeah I think you're right Cane.
00:30:51 <DuB> Anyone who can manage a regular 10k doing juuuust fine, hahah
00:31:07 <Crisium> i root for the tean with least tanks
00:31:27 <DuB> That's fair, cris. :D
00:32:05 <skram> h8rs
00:32:13 <skram> dont you like the 3 minute team fights?!
00:33:50 <DuB> Watching dvas speed-dive off of cliffs never gets old.
00:35:44 <Cane> Shadowburn Genji.
00:35:53 <DuB> Woop woop!
