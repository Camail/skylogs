00:00:52 <Dot`> hest
00:03:15 * Bio hugs Dot` 
00:03:29 <Bio> time to have some pizza
00:05:57 <reify> i already had my pizza
00:07:56 <DuB`> My brother brought pizza!
00:08:02 <DuB`> And my lunch earlier was a pizza.
00:08:52 <Bio> a successful day for tlp
00:09:33 <DuB`> "Sean Plott is the Official Host of The International"
00:09:34 <DuB`> Huh
00:11:28 <Bio> neato
00:25:39 <ZK-phone> Didn't know day 9 was much into dota
00:27:28 <Camail_> i dont think he's into much because he's a game dev now
00:27:35 <Camail_> and the one thing game devs dont do, is play games
00:28:05 <Bio> he's been doing a learning dota thing with purge forever
00:28:29 <Bio> also I think he's taken a backseat to being a dev, but idk about that
00:39:41 <reification> night all
00:39:51 <DuB`> G'night reef
00:48:07 <ZK-phone> Yea, he left artillery a while back, dont know what happened afterwards 
00:56:13 <Camail_> maybe the game went under
00:56:29 <Camail_> and he realized he didnt want to make games, just make his version of BW
00:57:04 <Camail_> the game industry is rough, publishers can make you hate your idea babies
01:01:08 <ZK-phone> Well, the whole platform went down a month after he left
01:01:39 <ZK-phone> So he might have jumped ship then, wonder what he up to
01:02:42 <Camail_> Dot` go to sleep
01:02:55 <Dot`> i am
01:02:58 <Dot`> reading
01:03:27 <Dot`> i have work tomorow, rip
01:06:12 <DuB`> Work is good for you.
01:06:39 <Bio> GIT MONI
01:06:47 <Bio> ACQUIRE FOODS
01:07:19 <DuB`> There is a direct link between the hours you work and the number of pizzas you can buy.
01:10:24 <Dot`> hmmm, this is good logic
01:17:32 <ZK-phone> Ice cream pizza is great

02:51:43 <Camail> i was part of the generation that watched anime without knowing it was anime, i wonder if that still happens
02:52:27 <Camail> dub did you ever watch anime accidentally 
02:52:32 <Camail> before The Corruption
02:52:44 <DuB`> the wuh
02:54:06 <Camail> you going to japan
02:54:10 <Camail> and being corrupted 
02:54:41 <DuB`> Yeh

11:59:11 <Rawr|Fone> Reef reef!
12:01:10 <Micen_> good morning
12:36:11 <Rawr|Fone> Hai micen
12:40:09 <Golly> virtus proooOooooOo
12:41:08 <Micen> Hi Rawr how is the tennis of tables
12:42:24 <Rawr|Fone> Gooooooooood
12:42:30 <Rawr|Fone> How are you today micen
12:43:13 <Micen> doing okay. bit tired, didnt sleep at all last night. 
12:43:55 <Micen> found out that the guy who owned the husky wants him back after two months of not hearing a word. 
12:44:08 <Rawr|Fone> D:
12:44:16 <Micen> and was expecting us to feed, care for and board his dog for for free. 
12:45:22 <Micen> any my sister wont tell him to go shove it since shes the one dealing with him. 
12:47:16 <Rawr|Fone> What a guy
12:49:19 <Micen> yeah, class act. HE gets arrested because he is fightig with his boyfriend again and was afraid for his and his dogs life after going to jail for assualt, again. Now hes back with the boyfriend and wants the dog.
12:51:18 <Rawr|Fone> :/
12:52:07 <Micen> yeah this dude sucks
12:53:40 <Micen> But we do have legal standing since he didnt make much attempt to get the dog back we can claim him as abandoned property since its across state lines and my state doesn't have a minimum amount of time for property to be considered abandoned. 
12:56:18 <Rawr|Fone> That sounds good
13:00:31 <Micen> So fingers crossed that he doesnt fight it
13:08:59 <reification> sounds like you are getting your rda of drama :/
13:11:51 <Micen> yep. and thats on top of normal drama that comes from 5 adults living in a house.

21:13:00 <DuB`> It turns out learning mandarin is pretty easy and straighforward when you already know most of the characters.
21:13:18 <DuB`> I started just last week and have made more progress than I expected.
21:13:32 <skram> Talk to me in mandarin, DuB`
21:14:35 <DuB`> Uh
21:14:38 <DuB`> Dunno how to type it
21:15:25 <Phearlock> Make something up, it's not like he'll know you're doing it wrong.

21:16:13 <DuB`> Actually, the app I have been using is prioritizing grammar over vocab for now.
21:16:19 <DuB`> So I know how to say some things.
21:16:25 <Phearlock> Maybe not skram =)
21:16:31 <Phearlock> I am merely assuming
