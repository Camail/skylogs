162.248.74.115:0:Sun :20 <Micen_> this is getting uncanny sweetie's ability to always pick the pony based option.
11:42:27 <Dot`> :)
11:43:56 <Dot`> skram, Phearlock
11:45:09 <skram> wut
11:45:20 <Dot`> next time we play DnD and fight goblins, we need to grab one of thier horns
11:46:24 <skram> what it do
11:46:40 <motbob> .choose kick ass, chew bubblegum
11:47:32 <Dot`> well skram, they use the horns to communicate, like to call for help and to give the all clear
11:48:00 <skram> can i stick it on my skull helmet and say rude words to them then
11:48:37 <Dot`> its not a loud speaker
11:48:39 <Dot`> haha
11:57:13 <Rawr|Phone> My day is good so far dot
11:57:24 <Rawr|Phone> How is yours
11:59:15 <Dot`> its going ok
11:59:36 <Rawr|Phone> Nice
11:59:40 * Micen_ has already finished sketching horse. 
12:07:13 <Dot`> wel micen, where is it?!
12:07:34 <Micen_> was charging phone to point where camera could yake picture
12:08:08 <Micen_> also i am developing a bad habit that I need to break. 
12:08:35 <Micen_> im developing what has to be the pony equivalent of c-mouth
12:08:52 <Micen_> all my mouths look the same and its bad
12:12:25 <Micen_> http://sta.sh/01yzgs7lpwct
12:12:32 <Micen_> cadance and flurry heart
12:15:51 <Dot`> flurry hearts head is a bit big?
12:15:57 <Dot`> or is it an angel thing
12:16:12 <Dot`> angle
12:16:19 <Dot`> uhm i need to check spelling
12:16:34 <Dot`> angle
12:18:28 <Micen_> might be a bit big. 
12:20:46 <Micen_> i suck at adjusting the scale of everything for younger ponies. Which is why you never see me draw the CMC or DT or other small small horses
12:20:55 <Micen_> but i am learning
12:25:39 <motbob> the Minnesota Asian Pacific American Bar Association, Association of Black Lawyers, Hispanic Bar Association, Lavender Bar Association (a.k.a. LGBT), and Minnesota Women Lawyers are having a joint event downtown in March
12:26:06 <motbob> for law students who would be members of those organizations
12:26:19 <motbob> it's a networking event
12:26:37 <motbob> I'm struggling to find a minority group that isn't covered
12:26:56 <Micen_> Brony lawyers
12:27:03 <motbob> basically, then, this is an event for non white male heterosexuals
12:27:20 <Dot`> trump bringing america together?
12:27:32 <motbob> but not to worry, since I can just go to the white male heterosexual event in April
12:27:36 <Micen_> are hipster lawyers a thing?
12:28:02 <motbob> BREAKING NEWS: white male heterosexual networking event cancelled after protests
12:28:08 <Dot`> are you saying you never heard of them?
12:28:12 <Dot`> micen
12:28:29 <skram> Cant you just pretend to be gay
12:29:19 <motbob> actually that's not such a bad idea
12:29:25 <motbob> since I'm not in a relationship
12:29:43 <motbob> and it's not foreseeable if/when I would enter one
12:30:47 <skram> that sounds like the plot from a romantic comedy
12:30:52 <motbob> is asexual part of LGBT? I could pull that off
12:31:00 <skram> probably
12:31:29 <Dot`> well go there as a hetrosexual and YOU will be the minority there
12:31:43 <motbob> there was a video about a closeted guy who was outed when the Harvard LGBT law school organization contacted his house for recruiting
12:31:59 <motbob> his mom said she was hoping he was lying about being gay to get into better law schools
12:34:20 <motbob> i wish I had been part of some kind of organization in high school where I could talk about how out of place I felt among my horny-ass peers
12:34:42 <motbob> absolutely unable to identify with people who said stuff like "I'd wreck her" or w/e
12:35:03 <motbob> but, since I have been out of high school, that sort of thing hasn't been a concern
12:35:09 <Micen_> I read about that guy.
12:35:27 <Micen_> and yeah ace is a part of the LGBTQIA+ stuff
12:35:39 <motbob> and so it would be wrong for take advantage of an organization who provides needed support for people who do still need it (mostly trans people at this point)
12:39:03 <Dot`> Runbunny: http://imgur.com/gallery/D2Nb1
12:39:28 <Runbunny> That certainly is a bunny.
12:40:18 <Micen_> Here is a question for you all. If you tell someone who is a job recruiter that you can't do factory work and they call you. What kind of position do you think it would be for?
12:42:05 <motbob> counting cars that pass by on the road
12:42:13 <motbob> to measure traffic
12:42:16 <Micen_> factory work. 
12:42:30 <motbob> well, that was going to be my second guess
12:42:40 <Micen_> and even worse is that the recruiter is my sister. 
12:42:46 <motbob> lmao
12:43:03 <Micen_> I have literally told her "I can not do factory work." Then she calls with god damn factory work.
12:45:28 <motbob> why a total bar on factory work? there are lots of different kinds of factories
12:45:54 <motbob> I can't (really, won't) do certain types of factory work, but some is OK
12:46:00 <Micen_> Bad back. hereditary.
12:46:12 <Micen_> and its literally machine operator jobs in the area. 
12:47:59 <Micen_> (also factories here are crazy and expect 12 hours a day 7 days a week. Call out once due to being sick and you're fired.) 
12:48:24 <Micen_> But then again Kentucky is an at-will state so thats par for the course. 
12:48:59 <motbob> oh baby
12:49:17 <motbob> that's an insame deal. gimme that much overtime please
12:53:59 <Micen_> at 10 an hour. 
12:54:03 <motbob> ok i registered for the event
12:54:31 <motbob> you get healthcare though
12:55:02 <motbob> 10 years ago, tell me $10/hour is what you're offering, and I'll say "haha wat a joke"
12:55:19 <motbob> but now, any full time job comes with a big bonus
12:55:34 <motbob> if you have health care from other sources, then who cares, but...
12:55:57 <motbob> of course, it's all moot if you're unable to physically do the job
12:56:54 <Micen_> yeah. I need a nice desk/call center job. but the ones that run here either want a degree and 2+ years experience or 5 years experience for entry level call center stuff. 
12:57:24 <Micen_> I just need to suck it up and get back into retail. I was happiest there, because at least i got to see interesting people. 
13:01:07 <Runbunny> Dot`, 
13:01:12 <Runbunny> What is this? https://i.redditmedia.com/OCmZAUvxC1U3QHnJDbIOWrn7vB00RWMASq9qvuWHif8.jpg?w=961&s=a643153bc610eec5399fc244a5824f51
13:02:36 <motbob> parmesean cheese, right?
13:02:40 <Micen_> Doggy Montana. 
13:02:49 <skram> its a meth lab runbunny
13:02:49 <motbob> no, sawdust
13:03:10 <Runbunny> It's a good boy skram.
13:03:16 <skram> good good boy
13:04:03 <motbob> theory: this is evidence from a raid of a parm cheese factory, where the owners are suspected of diluting their cheese with fillers (sawdust, other cellulose, etc)
13:04:17 <motbob> the dog is a special sawdust-smelling dog
13:06:38 <Dot`> makes sense
13:23:53 <Runbunny> skram
13:23:56 <Runbunny> Trouble
13:24:02 <Runbunny> I need your expertise.
13:24:28 <skram> at your service
13:25:52 <Runbunny> There are wild mooses in Denmark.
13:25:56 <Runbunny> What do I do?
13:26:18 <skram> dont carve your initials into them
13:27:16 <Runbunny> They are going to kill me.
13:27:31 <skram> only if they deem you unworthy
13:44:45 <Runbunny> Dot`, http://i.imgur.com/zcLg2M6.jpg
13:45:02 <Dot`> AWWWWW
13:45:06 <Dot`> i NEED one

14:20:35 <motbob> i edited garkoak's fanfic that was posted on eqd
14:20:44 <motbob> therefore i am the Premier Expert here
14:21:17 <skram> Would you put that on your resume
14:21:25 <motbob> and I declare that any employment-related stuff associated with ponies is toxic

19:40:50 <Phearlock> rawr this is not helping your case
19:41:17 <Rawr|Fone> Dot is warping the truth
19:42:04 <Phearlock> Soup and bread are both food. They may be alternative food though (if a more desirable food is available).

22:53:55 <DuB`> Oh dear.
22:54:14 <skram> moose heart is alright though
