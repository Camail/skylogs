04:12:19 <Camail> eh, i had fun
04:12:29 <Camail> we didnt play bad
04:12:44 <Camail> we just had a guy go 4-22
04:13:06 <Bio> yeah. they were just better. IDK. just bummed about other shit
04:13:24 <Camail> naaah they really werent better
04:13:26 <Bio> took a while to knock the rust off and we were in a hole to begin with
04:13:30 <Bio> the one guy was
04:13:36 <Bio> that or he was walling
04:13:38 <Bio> idk
04:13:45 <Camail> he got kills from bottom mid and b looking ct
04:13:51 <Camail> thats pretty much it
04:14:05 <Camail> then it was an awp v rifle
04:14:06 <Bio> The retakes he had were sketch
04:14:34 <Bio> but maybe i just don't know any better
04:14:49 <Camail> if the others had any idea how to play inferno it would've been much less one sided
04:15:29 <Camail> part of the sketchiness is his unpunished aggression, the other is latency giving peekers advantage
04:15:37 <Camail> i didnt see anything blatant
04:15:57 <Bio> Then im just T R I G G E R E D
04:15:59 <Camail> we were getting flanked like crazy because they got 1-2 early picks then could do whatever they wanted
04:15:59 <Bio> haha
04:16:16 <Camail> you did well on b, when you were allowed to play it
04:16:24 <Camail> certainly new the basics of the site better than any of them
04:16:45 <Camail> i got a smoke kill so I'm satisfied with my retaking that game
04:16:58 <Bio> haha
04:17:00 <Bio> saw that
04:17:03 <Camail> also they never bought smokes?
04:17:08 <Camail> or at least never used them properly
04:18:01 <Camail> but you cant expect more from gn1 and 2, who knows how long they've even been playing
04:18:15 <Camail> I've probably played more inferno than they have all of csgo
04:19:29 <Bio> prolly

17:08:17 <Micen|droid> Apparently I am perfectly fine and there is no issue. 
17:08:53 <reification> well that‚Äôs real helpful of them D:
17:09:34 <Micen|droid> I can't walk without needing to stop every few seconds or fall over. My right side is numb and I have no feeling. But nope, im just peachy
17:10:53 <Bio> isn't that like... serious?
17:11:02 <Micen|droid> Yeah
17:11:21 <Bio> thats one of the signs of a stroke
17:11:25 <reification> i am not a medical expert but i can tell that does not come under ‚Äúno issue‚Äù
17:11:29 <Bio> like legit
17:11:44 <Micen|droid> There is a reason Robert Kirkman literally based the hospital Rick walks out of in issue one of TWD on this specific hospital
17:12:41 <Micen|droid> Like its a literal outline of the building, at the time of publish of course, including its acronym
17:13:08 <Micen|droid> Oh also, it isnt a hospital. 
17:13:21 <Micen|droid> Its a regional healthcare center
17:13:33 <Micen|droid> They lost hospital status a bit over a year ago
17:14:45 <Micen|droid> Hahaha you want to hear the kicker
17:14:49 <Dot`> micen pls
17:14:52 <Dot`> go somewhere else D:
17:14:59 <Dot`> and get help
17:15:07 <Dot`> that place sounds bad

17:15:35 <Micen|droid> ...

22:44:13 <Dot`> <3
22:47:15 <Golly> i found a box of nugatti in the cupboard that just barely hasnt expired yet
22:50:24 <Dot`> what a day!
22:51:58 <Golly> i now feel appropriately disgusting
22:56:19 <Camail> good
22:56:21 <Camail> let it glow
23:00:37 <Phearlock> Does nugatti even expire?
23:00:44 <Phearlock> it just has a "best before" date
23:00:52 <Phearlock> It's still good a couple years later
23:02:20 <Golly> i think its time to quit when all of it comes out at once
23:03:37 <Camail> you misspelled "eat it all"
23:04:11 <Golly> mm chocolate dust
