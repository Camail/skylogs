21:53:16 <Raelcun> I really wish all the Irma coverage didn't switch instantly to Florida instead of covering what's going on in Barbuda and the caribean
21:53:26 <Raelcun> Barbuda might realistically never be the same they got hit so hard
21:54:00 <Dot`> the bits i have seen have been grim 
21:54:40 <Dot`> but yea, its a lot about florida man now it seems
21:55:12 <Raelcun> Realistically this isn't even that bad for Florida they've dealt with this before
21:55:22 <Raelcun> IT weakened before it hit shore because that's what hurricanes do
21:55:48 <Raelcun> But the islands weren't big enough for that to happen

21:59:10 <Raelcun> Most of the Caribean got hit pretty hard. Cuba got spared most of it and iss the best off iirc

22:05:18 <Dot`> When is GDQ for island relief please rael
22:05:38 <Raelcun> We couldn't really do one with registration and game submission going on
22:05:43 <Raelcun> and we couldn't push it back further
22:06:06 <Raelcun> plus everyone who had just done HRDQ was still a recovering from that and not wanting to kill themselves doing 2 mini events into sumbissions
22:06:14 <Dot`> its rough, just after all the fund raisers for the first hurricane, the second hits
22:09:53 <Dot`> what else you been up to rael
22:10:13 <Raelcun> Watching a lot of starcraft, waitting for more starcraft, being lazy
22:10:26 <Dot`> i like the possibilty of shield battery
22:10:41 <Raelcun> Is shield battery still at hing?
22:10:48 <Raelcun> SC:R did everything they were planning to do
22:10:58 <Dot`> no no

22:11:08 <Raelcun> ohhh
22:11:11 <Raelcun> I meant brood war
22:11:16 <Raelcun> that's why I said starcraft not sc2
22:11:43 <Raelcun> I stopped paying attention to sc2 ages ago when it became clear blizzard had no idea what made starcraft fun to watch when LOTV came out and their subsequent attempts to fix it
22:12:05 <Dot`> ah, i havnt really diffrentiated lately, been watchign a bit of both
22:12:28 <Raelcun> I wound up on the starcraft subreddit the other day due to the sea nonsense and aws shocked at how everything had like 6 comments
