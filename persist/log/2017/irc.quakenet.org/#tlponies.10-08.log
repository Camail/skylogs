21:28:33 <Dot`> crisium!
21:28:59 <Dot`> yea cane, i hit him a few times with my pistol, ran out of ammo, then knife got him 1 shot
21:29:04 <Crisium> hi dot
21:29:58 <DuB`> In my stalker game I got a silenced pistol and like 300 rounds, it's the only thing I use. :P

21:32:23 <Dot`> helpful beeping started right as I died
21:32:36 <BioPon> Dot pls live
21:32:44 <Dot`> it was a random one, not a marked field
21:33:08 <Dot`> another iron man is rip Bio
21:33:21 <DuB`> Not very iron of him.
21:46:02 <BioPon> I believe!
21:46:09 <BioPon> Can do the thing!
21:47:04 <Dot`> not now, he so ded
21:48:45 <motbob> i am meditating to take my mind off the fact that my internet speed is 1Mbps right now
21:49:29 <Dot`> thats inhuman!
21:49:40 <Dot`> third world savage almost
21:50:48 <motbob> i'm trying to put those kinds of thoughts out of my mind via meditation
21:50:56 <motbob> it's a miracle that the internet exist at all, really
21:51:23 <motbob> videos and streams still look fine in 360p
21:52:15 <DuB`> Three-hundred and sixty IS a whole lot of p's.
21:52:18 <Dot`> i recall my days out on the african savanna, with my 384 kbps internet
21:52:31 <DuB`> THIRTY DOZEN
21:52:33 <Dot`> trying to watch sc2 streams that where 3 pixels
21:52:45 <Dot`> dark times
21:53:07 <Dot`> oh, 10 minutes till that DnD round table thing should start
21:54:33 <motbob> i feel completely at peace now
21:54:44 <Dot`> did you stab someone?
21:54:45 <motbob> not because of my meditation, but because my internet fixed itself
21:55:03 <Dot`> maybe meditation fixes internet
21:55:28 <DuB`> Only if you're an omnic.
22:10:14 <Dot`> https://go.twitch.tv/itmejp

22:10:28 <Dot`> swoots?
22:22:03 <reification> sweetie no like twitch beta
22:22:12 <reification> https://www.twitch.tv/itmejp
22:23:04 <motbob> my major complaint with twitch is how slow it is, so i'm glad it's revamping itself
22:23:19 <motbob> it was comparable to something like hearthpwn (shudder)
