15:40:46 <DuB`> dub#1790
15:41:13 <ZK> yea, vipers will catch em if carriers are just on their own
15:41:29 <ZK> carriers are a deathball unit at this point
15:42:09 <Crisium> they only work in 1 BW matchup, but i like that its Carriers vs Ground.  i like this interaction better
15:43:43 <ZK> yea, BW seems to have quite a bit that doesn't work in many matchups
15:43:45 <ZK> ie bio
15:44:05 <ZK> but at the same time, it gives a nice lore to terran
15:44:43 <Crisium> bio so useless in tvt, its amazing
15:44:49 <Crisium> most players only make 1-3
15:44:57 <Crisium> scvs beat them in equal numbers
15:45:12 <Crisium> vultures eat them for free
15:45:27 <Crisium> i do enjoy bio chese in tvp, but sadly its rare
15:46:30 <ZK> yea, mech might not be the most viable in sc2, but its nowhere near as bad as how bio is in bw :P
15:47:37 <Crisium> is mech standard in any matchup?
15:48:13 <ZK> not standard, no
15:48:17 <ZK> well, actually TvT
15:48:29 <ZK> but its usually biomech, but some do pure bio or pure mech and it works fine
15:48:42 <ZK> TvZ has some mech, and TvP is pretty much for all-ins
15:49:06 <ZK> TvZ is playable, but it's map dependent because of how positional and slow it is
16:01:17 <Crisium> these mutas
16:02:09 <ZK> ded now
16:02:31 <ZK> 47 prones ded
16:02:32 <ZK> damn
16:02:45 <Crisium> he never got blink tho?
16:02:49 <DuB`> First stackgame is a win.
16:02:59 <DuB`> Get in on this, Dot` Zounds :P
16:03:24 <Zounds> shortly
16:03:56 <ZK> yea not getting blnk is weird
16:03:59 <ZK> that was a nice fight
16:04:02 <ZK> there's blink!
16:10:15 <Crisium> ZK made me look up an old Bio TvP that I liked.  also will link for Cane
16:10:16 <Crisium> https://youtu.be/ywJw3Lvc4xI?t=7m22s
16:10:30 <Cane> Ha, I know without clicking what that is, but thank you. <3
16:10:40 <Crisium> yes its very famous
16:12:13 <ZK> wait what, bio?
16:14:32 <ZK> nice splits
