11:22:30 <Phearlock> If this is true and some obsidian guys are involved I am going to be a happy guy.
11:25:02 <Phearlock> That said, they already are pretty confirmed to have been working on pillars 2 all this time so
11:25:09 <Phearlock> And hey pillars 2 is fucking hype
11:30:03 <skram> as much as i liked FNV i dont know if a sequel is a good idea?
11:30:50 <Phearlock> I dunno about a direct sequel
11:31:31 <Phearlock> But no fallout game has really been all that similar to the one before it (except 1 and 2)
11:31:47 <skram> yeah
