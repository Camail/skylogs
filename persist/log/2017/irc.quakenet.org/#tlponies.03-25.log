00:56:47 <Saurabhinator> eyo
00:57:10 <reification> hey saura <3
01:00:20 <Dot`> hows it going saura
01:04:02 <Saurabhinator> today not so good
01:04:44 <Dot`> :(
01:04:47 <Dot`> whats up
01:07:06 <Saurabhinator> lost a bit of one of my teeth
01:07:18 <Saurabhinator> i was chewing on ice cubes while drinking cold beer
01:07:28 <Saurabhinator> fractured one of my teeth
01:07:38 <Saurabhinator> just got it filled in 
01:07:48 <Saurabhinator> now i need to get it crownde and thats gunna be expensive
01:08:16 <reification> you need a nhs
01:08:35 <reification> i attacked my teeth with a desk and a frisbee as a kid
01:08:41 <reification> would not recommend it
01:09:06 <skram> nhs gives you free dental work?
01:09:23 <reification> i was under 18
01:09:32 <reification> not anymore but is still cheap
01:09:39 <skram> ah
01:10:03 <Dot`> that sucks saura
01:14:50 <Saurabhinator> I dont have any dental insurance
01:15:00 <reification> oh dear
01:15:01 <Saurabhinator> rip my bank account
01:15:07 <reification> do you still do art commisions saura?
01:15:29 <Saurabhinator> havent had time to do that ina  long time
01:15:51 <Saurabhinator> it's ok I can afford it
01:16:19 <motbob> dental insurance isn't really insurance
01:16:27 <motbob> it's just pre-paid dental expenses
01:16:39 <motbob> since dental care isn't catastrophic when it happens
01:17:12 <skram> painful though
01:17:44 <Saurabhinator> my fracture wasnt actually that painful
01:17:53 <Saurabhinator> idk if thats a good or bad thing tho
01:19:20 <Dot`> well if your tooth isnt going black you didnt kill a nerve
01:21:56 <Dot`> and no pain means no exposed nerve
01:22:01 <Dot`> so sounds good so far saura
01:22:21 <Dot`> ive had both, im unlucky with teeth
01:22:32 <Dot`> also had about 6 extracted
01:25:32 <reification> i started with extra, then my adult teeth missed pushing out the baby teeth‚Ä¶
01:26:11 <reification> finally they just gave me general anasthetic and yanked out a whole bunch in one time
01:26:49 <Dot`> so lucky
01:27:15 <skram> ive never had to do major dental work
01:27:16 <Dot`> i had 6 injections in 1 side of my mouth, then next week had to get 5 in the other side
01:27:33 <skram> just a filling or two
01:27:41 <reification> yeah my way sounds a lot better
