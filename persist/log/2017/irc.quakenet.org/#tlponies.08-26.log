03:38:34 <DuB`> Killin' aliens.
03:38:45 <DuB`> Getting every single one of my troops wounded.
03:40:55 <Phearlock> Spreading the love around
03:42:34 <Bio> remember, half cover is no cover
03:42:55 <Bio> 95% shots are as good as 0% shots
03:43:06 <Bio> rookies always miss
03:43:14 <Phearlock> Crowd control is nice, but enemies that are dead are crowd controlled forever
03:43:38 <Phearlock> Sectoids love making zombies instead of doing anything useful
03:44:26 <DuB`> Had to go into a big mission with 4xRookies
03:44:43 <DuB`> Snekboi killed almost immediately, I just restarted. :P
03:44:50 <DuB`> Cheated? haha
03:45:09 <Phearlock> only cheating if you decided to not restart.
03:45:14 <Phearlock> and then changed your mind
04:04:45 <DuB`> Sectoid takes a stroll directly through my squad with 1 HP and all 4 miss him two round in a row.
04:05:04 <DuB`> As he escapes around a corner I give up and just throw a grenade at him.
04:06:22 <Phearlock> Typically if have like, a way to guarantee an enemy will die and some non-guaranteed shots spare, you take the spare shots, and if they don't kill, use the guaranteed kill.
04:06:53 <Phearlock> Balance speed with safety etc

19:42:01 <Zounds> reif why are you not a cute anime gambling girl
19:42:17 <carcinisation> i'm sure the animators know their target audience
19:43:37 <carcinisation> zounds i try to be anime and do plenty of gambling, the other two are beyond me though... 
19:46:03 <skram> im sure you could be the cutiest grill if you wanted to reif
19:47:09 <carcinisation> your confidence is sadly misplaced skram
19:56:02 <Camail> in the last episode someone basically has sex with gambling
19:56:05 <Camail> like, the idea of it
19:56:09 <Camail> it's pretty great
19:56:25 <skram> how does that work
19:56:34 <carcinisation> well now the gambling could be going better, JJ losing repeatedly D:
19:59:48 <carcinisation> ok when ppl limp 3b jam trash into KK it's good times 
20:04:37 <Runbunny> Dot`, Dot` Dot` 
20:04:42 <Dot`> Runbun!
20:04:47 <Runbunny> There is "dog week" on a tv channel here
20:05:01 <Runbunny> They're just showing corgi puppies in a cage now
20:05:12 <Dot`> amg
20:05:22 <Dot`> best channel ever

20:29:06 <Dot`> cam, should i be runnign around in the abyss before doing the three ?
20:29:25 <Dot`> im not going accedently finish or anything ?
20:29:41 <Dot`> or you know, pass a point where i cant go back
20:36:09 <Bio> I don't think there is a point like that
20:36:16 <Bio> actually maybe one
20:36:49 <Bio> have you got the dream nail
20:37:39 <Dot`> yea
20:39:31 <Camail> Dot`  you'll know the end when you see it
20:40:05 <Camail> and at any time you can alt f4 the game to go back to a save so there is no real point of no return
20:40:30 <Camail> Bio  i actually hit the point of no return because that one person did the stabby thing and i didn't know i had to do the special thing to enter the place
20:40:33 <Camail> so i paniced
20:40:36 <Camail> and alt f4'd
20:40:51 <Camail> i realized what i was supposed to do, but it was 3 seconds too late
20:42:57 <Camail> but yea dot just go everywhere and do whatever you want

23:28:53 <reification> g‚Äônight all
23:28:54 <Dot`> lol cam, that gate in the abyss needing all 7 blue
23:28:58 <Dot`> gnight reif
23:29:08 <DuB`> Seeya reif~
23:29:50 <Crisium> hd birb
23:29:58 <DuB`> Ye
23:31:53 <Camail> yea dot it was a fun little puzzle
23:32:05 <Camail> cant remember what you get at the end of it tho
23:32:21 <Camail> we
23:32:37 <Camail> should play a thing...maybe
23:32:37 <Dot`> hmm, i walked off got myself hurt down to 1 blue and it still has the 2 'saved' in the roots
23:32:50 <Dot`> so i may not have to go to all 7 cacoons without being hurt once to get in
23:32:58 <Camail> hm?
23:33:25 <Dot`> the gate about half way down the abyss
23:33:34 <Dot`> has a blue orb and some roots with bulbs
23:33:44 <Camail> have you figured it out?
23:34:02 <Dot`> well i guessed it  was tied to the cacoons
23:34:08 <Dot`> blue heart things
23:34:23 <Camail> oh right, those
23:34:52 <Dot`> my first thought was i would have to go get ALL the blue in 1 run and deliver it
23:35:03 <Dot`> which seemed insane, but i dont tihnk its that bad
23:35:22 <Camail> it is not even close to that bad
23:35:32 <Camail> but you are close to the answer, lore-wise
23:35:51 <Camail> like, you are thinking in the same topic as the solution
23:36:18 <Dot`> well i got back with 2 blue hearts and 2 bulbs filled as expected
23:36:31 <Dot`> BUT, they didnt unfill after i went off to get hurt
23:36:47 <Dot`> so i tihnk i just have to do a few runs to the nearest cacoon
23:36:52 <Dot`> will do it a bit later
23:37:25 <Camail> do the cocoons respawn?
23:37:36 <Camail> cuz i did not solve it that way
23:37:41 <Dot`> but the first thought of "Do I need to get EVERY cocoon in one run" 
23:37:50 <Dot`> was amusig≈=&◊RT´ƒ¬9°6! G#…]mKn˜V:!9kö‚_6Vô¯M;4}~W%v≥=>>0Ãª|]Q©†*®ª)`rrGáahÃ~‚{ad;ï˚71RN53 *3¢+.$+2«t(kCnD`ÿÈ±$ì˘÷o ı_tF9<d?%N;4:p2g&/'1B?N¨R5‡¸ñPb=6+î'Y#N
