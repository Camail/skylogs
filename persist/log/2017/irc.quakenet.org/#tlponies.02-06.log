20:38:14 <Dot`> runbun, i was up at 6, spent a lot of time on the bus and had to interact socialy today
20:38:22 <Dot`> its been rough
20:39:08 <Rawr|Fone> I'm happy for the others if they win, but it's not important to me if they lose
20:39:51 <Dot`> rawr pls, you need to care

20:40:33 <Dot`> http://imgur.com/gallery/sye65Ug
20:40:46 <Rawr|Fone> I do, but you can't blame people for losing
20:41:43 <skram> you totally can though
20:42:16 <Rawr|Fone> I could
20:47:56 <Runbunny> Rawr I think you should encourage them and push them forward to unveil their full potential.
20:48:04 <Runbunny> Also Skram is a butt.
20:48:38 <Rawr|Fone> I try to do that
