20:18:32 <Camail> man even on the second highest difficulty of witcher 3 this boss does 1 hit kills =/
20:18:41 <Camail> this story is fun, but this gameplay is kinda meh
20:18:51 <Camail> or at least it does NOT scale well at higher levels
20:23:29 <Golly> at least you can always turn it up and down at will
20:23:45 <Dot`> :/
20:27:19 <Camail> this finale(?) part of the dlc fell a bit flat, seeing as the witcher can NOT do horror
20:27:30 <Camail> you can't feel scared or intimidated when playing as geralt
20:28:19 <Camail> maybe they continue in the second dlc, i dunno, won't be buying it any time soon
20:28:24 <Camail> got to bang another redhead tho
20:28:27 <Golly> i was more disappointed with the romance options :p
20:29:03 <Camail> i like the doctor, that part was fun
20:29:08 <Golly> in blood and wine, that is
