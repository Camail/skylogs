00:08:25 <DuB`> They are
00:08:44 <DuB`> These
00:08:44 <DuB`> http://i.imgur.com/DXDr6d0.png

00:15:22 <CockRoach|42> https://twitter.com/SoualiganAmazon/status/833504090223177728
00:15:23 <DuB`> ...
00:15:38 <DuB`> You see dot, there's not a number in that entire sheet!
00:15:41 <DuB`> Obviously not math.
00:15:54 <DoT`> no numbers is true maths
00:16:35 <DuB`> !?
00:16:40 <skram> DoT` is right
00:16:42 <DuB`> That's called alphabets.
00:16:45 <DuB`> Which is grammar.
00:16:46 <DuB`> Not math.
00:19:38 <skram> you're wrong
00:19:49 <DuB`> ...
00:20:31 <DuB`> Flawless logic.
00:21:24 <skram> Are you not finished with your exams and stuff for a while dub

01:57:29 <Camail> why not steam
01:57:33 <Camail> the superior service
01:57:45 <Camail> steam also gets updates way quicker
01:58:29 <ZK> oftentimes gog also gives steam key. Unless I'm thinking of humble bundle
02:01:28 <Camail> gog doesnt do that
02:01:36 <Camail> it has its own client and everything
02:01:49 <Camail> strictly separate
02:01:55 <ZK> yea, it's humble bundle that offers both drm free and steam, my bad
