00:24:58 <reimeuk> the problem is the lack of ppl going there

00:50:56 <Camail> non sequitur - i just remembered my favorite thing about witcher 3
00:51:16 <Camail> watching someone put on a play in a game reminded me of the play
00:51:35 <Camail> i mashed through all the dialogue and didnt realize i had the script in my inventory
00:52:13 <Camail> so i had to do real time rhyme analysis and made it SO MUCH HARDER
00:52:26 <Camail> which i think they should do more of in games
00:52:35 <Camail> instead of the tropey "memorize your lines"
00:57:38 <DuB`> Stressful!
00:58:38 <Dot`> bio, i had pizza

04:09:16 <Bio> idk why
04:31:29 <Camail> depends on what you mean by fizzle out
04:31:45 <Camail> will it be really popular for along time? probably not
04:31:52 <Camail> but they are making dlc classes
04:31:56 <Camail> and its basically a fighting game
04:32:15 <Camail> so the core audience, which will stay pretty large, will stay with that game for awhile

16:46:03 <Bio> hey man
16:46:08 <Bio> if he can do it, great
16:46:18 <Bio> if not, well, my taxes this year werent all that horrible
16:46:39 <DuB`class> I'm getting $600 back!
16:46:47 <Bio> about the same for me
16:47:00 <DuB`class> Also it took less time to do my taxes than to do my tax homework.
16:47:01 <DuB`class> Hahah
16:47:08 <Dot`> lol
16:55:49 <DuB`class> ME:A does look like a game I'd like a lot.
16:56:06 <DuB`class> First ~new~ game I buy in a year?
16:56:30 <DuB`class> I don't even remember the last game I bought at full price besides overwatch.
16:56:31 <Dot`> wait a few months after it comes out
16:56:35 <Dot`> it will be bugged
16:56:39 <Dot`> and overpriced
16:56:50 <Dot`> its single player so no need to rush to buy
16:58:56 <Dot`> dub, didnt you say you havnt played the others?
16:59:04 <DuB`class> Yeh.
16:59:11 <DuB`class> Should?
16:59:34 <Dot`> they are cheap now, ME2 is even free on origin
16:59:39 <Bio> its an all new story
16:59:48 <Bio> so story wise it shouldn't matter
16:59:52 <Dot`> but bio, he doesnt even know if he likes mass effect
17:00:11 <Dot`> i dont know why he wouldnt
17:00:14 <Dot`> but still
17:00:53 <Dot`> seems silly to buy overpriced buggy new game when you can play ME1-3 until its fixed and come down in price a bit
17:01:17 <Bio> its a sad state when we assume a game comes out buggy
17:01:42 <Bio> but such is it
17:01:50 <Dot`> yip :(
17:02:15 <Bio> dot we play unfinished games all the time though. look at dorffort Kappa
17:02:31 <Bio> 1.0 nevr
17:04:44 <Dot`> dorf fort isnt bugged it feature rich!
17:04:49 <Dot`> like arma
