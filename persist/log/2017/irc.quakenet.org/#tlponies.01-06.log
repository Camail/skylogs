00:15:54 <DoT_> gnight reif <3
00:21:08 <DuB`> Time for some overwatch-watch while I relax with dinner.
00:21:11 <DuB`> Mmmmyeah
00:22:03 <skram> what are you eating for dinner dub
00:23:43 <DuB`> Sammich, probably.
00:23:55 <DuB`> Don't have much food, still gotta go shopping and brother has the car.
00:24:04 <DuB`> Mebbe I walk down the street and buy pizza!
00:24:47 <DoT_> order pizza
00:24:59 <DuB`> But then you have to tip the guy!
00:25:01 <DoT_> and get your brother rto pay for it
00:25:11 <DuB`> And it's like 300m from my apartment. >_>
00:25:26 <skram> ...is that too far for you?
00:25:44 <DuB`> No! It's why I'll walk there instead of ordering like dot suggested. O_ol
00:27:02 <DuB`> Was curious so I just checked it, actually 360 meters.
00:27:04 <DuB`> Close guess!

01:06:35 <DuB`> "Fixed"
01:06:41 <DuB`> Working as intended. Again.
01:07:52 <skram> At least he didnt hook that bot through 3 walls though??
01:08:02 <DuB`> Yes.
01:08:18 <DuB`> Woah, renegades beat CoL. 
01:08:19 <DuB`> HAHA
01:08:24 <DuB`> Gerrekt
01:08:39 <Cane> https://www.twitch.tv/overwatch_nge
01:08:44 <Cane> ^ What it says on the title.
01:08:55 <Cane> TeamLiquid has a tough match ahead. =)
01:10:58 <skram> pls beat the russians
01:11:13 <Cane> ^
01:11:46 <Cane> lol FCTFCTN's favorite hero is Sombra. Like they're gonna let her play that.
01:11:55 <DuB`> Haha
01:12:10 <Cane> Unless you're Complexity and have spent a lot of time making that work... I don't see it, not yet.
01:12:16 <DuB`> "Oh, you like sombra? I never knew, dude! Okay now serious, pick Reinhardt."
01:12:22 <Cane> Hahahah yeah.
01:12:51 <skram> well
01:13:01 <skram> i suppose its good to know your enemy
01:13:11 <skram> and sombra is probably your biggest threat as rein :p
01:14:01 <Cane> Shadowburn locked Genji.
01:14:06 <Cane> Here we go boys.
01:14:45 <DuB`> Either super srs or confident.
01:14:52 <DuB`> That's like having surefour start on mccree! :P
01:15:12 <skram> TL is ranked 31st on GG
01:15:17 <skram> faze is 5th :p
01:15:22 <Cane> Still rooting for TL.
01:15:34 <skram> always
01:16:06 <DuB`> Wait what.
01:16:13 <DuB`> I though TL lost the first fight badly!
01:16:22 <DuB`> 50-0
01:16:23 <Cane> That was just Shadowburn being bullshit, TL won the rest of their fights.
01:16:23 <DuB`> Huh
01:16:50 <skram> I didnt see any blue on the killfeed
01:16:57 <skram> this shit is weird
01:17:06 <DuB`> THIS IS SO CONFUSING
01:17:08 <Cane> Good SD.
01:17:18 <Cane> Using it to hold is solid.
01:17:29 <DuB`> HUGE REIN
01:17:31 <DuB`> Aw yehhhh
01:17:35 <Cane> LIQUID FIGHTING!
01:17:39 <skram> mesr is such a freakin beast
01:17:47 <skram> i wanna be just like him when i grow up
01:18:01 <CockRoach|42> bluestreak is running super dram world https://www.twitch.tv/bluustreak
01:18:04 <DuB`> Mesr and Ryb <3
01:18:13 <CockRoach|42> well, playing it at least
01:18:21 <skram> whats super dram world
01:18:31 <CockRoach|42> it's a smw hack
01:18:32 <skram> and does it involve akevitt
01:18:45 <CockRoach|42> grandpoobear will run it during agdq
01:18:57 <CockRoach|42> most likely not?
01:19:11 <Cane> skram, mesr is fantastic yeah.
01:19:35 <DuB`> Earthshatter in the first fight.
01:19:42 <skram> probably one of the best reins
01:19:44 <DuB`> Because 3-minute-long tank fight. :P
01:19:49 <Cane> TL has ults though.
01:20:02 <Cane> Shadowburn DESTROYS people.
01:20:54 <Cane> They're talking about nanoboosting Rapha's D.Va. That's more common than boosting a DPS?
01:20:55 <skram> wish there was more ow in europe
01:21:07 <DuB`> Mesr has been my favorite rein for a long time, but I'm falling a bit in love with how aggressive and lethal Ryb is.
01:21:09 <skram> Wanna see more misfits and nip
01:21:18 <Cane> Would love for more EU teams coming in and wrecking face.
01:21:36 <skram> out of TLs team, d.va is probably the best nano target yeah
01:21:39 <Cane> There are a number of Scandinavians on non-EU teams though, we're kind of scattered.
01:21:41 <DuB`> Yep.
01:21:52 <DuB`> Only other would be tracer, but she's impossible to keep alive with ana.
01:22:14 <Cane> Great shields.
01:22:23 <DuB`> Nanoblade countered!
01:22:35 <skram> The 2 best teams in the world both have more yuropeans than NAdudes
01:22:36 <skram> :P
01:23:06 <Cane> Yar.
01:23:55 <DuB`> Woooo!
01:23:55 <Cane> Holy crap Liquid.
01:23:56 <Cane> <3
01:24:33 <skram> Actually I dont think envyus has any NAbros at all now?
01:24:46 <skram> mickie is from thailand or something, but might be an expat or something.
01:24:50 <DuB`> RIP talespin. :T
01:25:20 <DuB`> Thai, yeah.
01:26:40 <skram> Dont need no talespin if you have the best d.va player in the world and arguably the best DPS player in the world
01:27:10 <Cane> If they don't need Talespin I'll take him. Dude's terrifying.
01:28:14 <Cane> skram, who are you referring to?
01:28:14 <skram> this might get tricky for liquid
01:28:18 <skram> no ultis
01:28:24 <DuB`> :O
01:28:31 <Cane> HOLY HOOK
01:28:43 <DuB`> Well then!
01:28:43 <skram> GUESS NOT??
01:28:52 <skram> the fuck
01:28:59 <skram> didnt expect this
01:29:03 <Cane> Um. Did TeamLiquid level up?
01:29:05 <Cane> That was nuts.
01:29:46 <skram> What does faze do when the one tactic they have doesnt work
01:30:52 <Cane> skram, who are the D.Va and DPS players you were talking about?
01:31:02 <skram> mickie and taimou
01:31:34 <skram> respectively
01:33:58 <Cane> Oh right. I know Taimou streams. Heard he's obnoxious but a fantastic player.
01:34:35 <skram> Thats probably true
01:34:38 <DuB`> Hahahah
01:35:04 <skram> I dont know why talespin left envyus but supposedly it was because taimou is a dick

01:35:33 <skram> dub knows all the OW gossip im sure
01:35:40 <DuB`> I would have him and surefour as pretty even for best DPS if taimou wasn't so incredible at roadhog.
01:35:45 <DuB`> Unfortunately he is.
01:36:11 <DuB`> Mesr wants blood!
01:36:21 <Cane> Biooooo.
01:36:48 <skram> c9 probably has one of the most individually skilled teams but they have not posted any remarkable wins yet
01:36:49 <Cane> Byeoooo.

02:00:56 <DuB`> C9 heyday~
02:01:08 <skram> I dont miss snipermeta

02:01:29 <Cane> ...
02:01:34 <skram> hero stacking meta was dumb
02:01:41 <skram> tank meta better than any other meta so far :p
02:02:04 <DuB`> lol Cane
02:02:11 <DuB`> Sombra got a bit stuffed.
02:03:16 <DuB`> LOL
02:03:24 <Cane> Eissfeldt was a fantastic Natural Selection 2 player. Like absolutely amazing.
02:03:32 <Cane> My friend Jennifer says in OW he's hit and miss.
02:03:48 <DuB`> Haven't seen a ton of him. :o That's cool to know though.
02:03:58 <Cane> Yeah, he was scary.
02:04:32 <skram> I think a lot of ow players are former gods in "dead" games
02:04:38 <skram> like tribes and quake and all that
02:04:43 <Cane> Oh yeah.
02:04:50 <Cane> Talespin went from Tribes to something else briefly and then to OW.
02:05:00 <Cane> In Tribes, Talespin was the absolute best sniper, no question, perfect aim.
02:05:04 <DuB`> Mhmm
02:05:24 <DuB`> Surefour was the best in dirty bomb and titanfall.
02:05:30 <Cane> Aye.
02:05:40 <Cane> And of course a lot of TF2 pros.
02:05:51 <Cane> But a lot of those are still frighteningly loyal to TF2.
02:05:53 <skram> i have no idea what dirty bomb is
02:06:05 <Cane> Another tactical shooter that existed for a while.
02:06:08 <Cane> Class based.
02:06:09 <skram> well muselk is a ow pro now
02:06:12 <Cane> But it was more basic.
02:06:26 <skram> one of the many games that tried to be tf2?
02:06:32 <Cane> Less TF2/OW, more CoD style.
02:06:39 <Cane> But longer TTK.
02:06:47 <skram> TTK?
02:06:48 <Cane> I tried it a few times, didn't like it much.
02:06:49 <Cane> Time to kill.
02:06:53 <skram> ah
02:06:54 <Cane> It has healers and classes.
02:08:32 <Cane> Don't hook first.
02:08:48 <DuB`> ^
02:09:06 <skram> Roadhog 101 right there
02:09:32 <Cane> First time I tried Roadhog I had Rael to explain some of this shit to me.
02:11:17 <DuB`> Woah.
02:11:31 <DuB`> PTR change not in notes: There is a new specific option for lucio, ."Allow backwards wallride" in Controls panel.
02:11:38 <DuB`> YAY
02:12:12 <Cane> ...
02:12:19 <Cane> !
02:12:27 <Cane> Holy crap, DuB` is now happy.
02:12:46 <Cane> And r/Overwatch will be full of DSPStanky gifs.
02:12:54 <DuB`> Sounds like a great thing. :D
02:12:56 <skram> :DD
02:14:13 <DuB`> If I had unlimited free time, I would go back through all major OW tourney VODs and find exactly what percentage of genji ults also involved the caster saying the words "slicing and dicing".
02:14:39 <skram> do it
02:14:41 <skram> do it for skrammen
02:14:41 <Cane> Oh god.
02:14:43 <Cane> Pls don't.
02:15:14 <Cane> Caster idiosyncrasies is a pet peeve of mine.
02:15:14 <DuB`> ZP says it nearly every time, hahaha
02:15:19 <DuB`> lol!
02:15:36 <Cane> Somewhere along the line, someone said "we do see" and now everybody does it.
02:15:47 <Cane> We DO see the Reinhardt coming in.
02:16:03 <Cane> The more of these you pick up on the worse it gets.
02:16:10 <skram> ...AND NOW I CANT NOT THINK ABOUT IT
02:16:13 <DuB`> !
02:18:18 <Cane> Great Rein play from Super to get the hold, damn.
02:18:59 <DuB`> wew
02:24:32 <DuB`> WHAT WAS THAT HOOK
02:24:33 <DuB`> hahahah

02:32:39 <DuB`> https://gfycat.com/LividFragrantClam
02:32:43 <DuB`> RIP hog, hahahaha
02:32:55 <DoT_> oh...
02:33:03 <DoT_> thats rough
02:33:06 <Cane> By the way, that keeps happening to me.
02:33:21 <Cane> I hook Tracers, the hook grabs, Tracer runs away and the hook just glides off.
02:33:42 <DuB`> Yeah, seen that a few times this week.
02:33:52 <Cane> Is that a recent thing? I haven't heard of it before.
02:34:01 <Camail> roadhog can go sit alone in a corner until the world forgets he exists
02:34:11 <DuB`> I like what mendo said - 
02:34:31 <BioPhone> Favorite caster idiosyncrasy; X coming out (Now)
02:34:32 <DuB`> I would want Roadhog’s hook ability to be put on a more utility based support character, and leave tanks to be just that; tanks. I’d like a hook be something that doesn’t mean 100% instant kill.
02:34:35 <DoT_> i assumed dubs link was gifs from the latest ptr
02:34:38 <DuB`>  But rather be something where you hit the hook and your team has to follow up for the kill. The hook itself and the means to instantly kill the target shouldn’t all be put on the same character, especially not a tank character.
02:34:43 <DuB`> It is, DoT_.
02:35:07 <DoT_> so the awnser to canes question is,  very recent
02:35:16 <DoT_> in the past few hours
02:35:17 <skram> now how would mendo propose to do that
02:35:24 <skram> make roadhog unable to fire? reduce his damage?
02:35:29 <DuB`> It's too late for that, skramm. :P
02:35:51 <DuB`> Base character design is too late.
02:35:57 <skram> yeah
02:36:24 <DuB`> Swap dva and roadhogs guns, or something.
02:36:55 <skram> yeah, that'll happen :p
02:37:20 <Cane> Let Pudge be Pudge.
02:38:34 <DuB`> Also DoT_ there have been weird inconsistent hook disjoints with movement abilities for a while now.
02:38:47 <DuB`> They keep reworking hook and nobody is really sure exactly how it works anymore. :P
02:39:33 <Cane> Well, I hope they make good on their promise to make the hook at least consistently place targets in front of Roadhog.
02:39:39 <Cane> Instead of, you know, 10 feet away or inside of him.
02:39:43 <Cane> Cough Ana Cough Lucio
02:39:47 <DoT_> i was only aware of the obvious hook issues and the "slide" some lighter characters had which got them behind him
02:47:16 <DuB`> So I guess there's still no concrete info on why C9 and fnatic dropped this NGE tourney.
02:47:22 <DuB`> Speculated korea OGN invites.
02:47:34 <DuB`> And "adam mentioned in gen chat the other day that they dropped in favor of a bigger opportunity"
02:47:37 <DuB`> From c9ow discord.
02:47:42 <DuB`> Mebbe!
02:51:40 <skram> what happened to envyus
02:53:46 <DuB`> Nothing since mlg.
03:10:42 <DuB`> skram Cane did you just see that soldier juking? 
03:10:43 <DuB`> Bahaha
03:11:55 <Cane> Hahah I saw.
03:12:19 <DuB`> wiggle wiggle wiggle
03:12:38 <Cane> Needs a "whoop whoop whoop" sound.
03:21:36 <DuB`> LOOL
03:21:51 <DuB`> One side effect of "ALWAYS landing target in front of roadhog"

03:26:39 <Cane> LOL
03:27:42 <Cane> Yeah they might need to fix that honestly. Have it be a straight line.
03:30:03 <skram> hahah
03:30:15 <skram> working as i n t e n d e d
03:43:00 <DuB`> I wonder what happened to "dub" on quakenet.
03:43:12 <DuB`> The nick was taken for YEARS by "henry paasovara".
03:43:20 <DuB`> Suddenly was open last year. :o

04:03:29 <Cane> I was warned about MoonMoon's chat.
04:03:32 <Cane> It did not disappoint.

04:26:28 <Camail> hey I'm a computer
04:26:32 <Camail> stop all the memeloading
04:29:21 <Bio> you wouldn't download a meme...

04:43:29 <Camail> NA CS is in a fucking free fall right now
04:43:49 <Bio> when isn't it though
04:45:24 <Camail> most of the time, compared to this
04:45:36 <Camail> metaphorical civil war against the team owners
04:45:47 <Camail> maybe this means a player union?
04:46:08 <Bio> hmm
04:46:17 <Bio> i've not been following it, whats going on?
04:48:22 <Camail> the NA orgs tried to make an NA exclusive league
04:48:40 <Camail> and force their teams to choose between them and EPL
04:48:56 <Camail> the players elected sir scoots as their rep and have been fighting it
04:49:24 <Camail> because epl/esea are the backbone of the fps community
04:49:55 <Bio> ah
04:50:57 <Camail> its a fight between eu and na team owners basically
04:51:16 <Camail> and the playerts are pissed and telling them both to fuck off, and anyone trying to make them choose sides to fuck off harder
04:51:43 <Camail> NA orgs made the first aggressive move and have seen insane backlash
04:51:52 <Camail> fuck na only leagues
04:51:56 <Camail> its like women only leagues
04:51:59 <Camail> no one fucking cares
04:52:03 <Camail> we want to see top teams
04:52:10 <Camail> not top teams*
04:53:01 <motbob> players will lose
04:53:30 <motbob> there is too much $ dedicated to making CS:GO a Sport
04:54:10 <motbob> not sure what the players' leverage here is
04:56:03 <motbob> i don't see it as a fight between NA and EU orgs since in the backdrop is the looming prospect of a televised sports league which would naturally be an NA league just like every other big sports league in America
05:12:19 <Camail> the players all deicded to quit PEA
05:12:22 <Camail> so yea
05:12:56 <Camail> the player's leverage is that they are the core content creators
05:13:32 <Camail> this is all leading towards a plays union
05:13:39 <Camail> players*

06:48:00 <Camail> man looking at what has been happening to EG is amusing
06:48:13 <Camail> its abundantly clear that twitch only wanted their parent company
06:48:45 <Camail> wonder why they didn't try and figure that out during the deal, probably too messy to try
06:49:22 <Camail> also RIP alex garfield when you build a parent company to serve your esports company and they end up getting ripped apart anyway
07:08:39 <Camail> .tell cane well if you didnt hear, jwong got picked up by echo fox, as did a ton of other former eg/ former madcatz players
07:17:17 <Cane> Hmm.

23:26:52 <CockRoach|42> picarto has this kinda nifty feature (it's quite new, you might not know about it, i think it's only been around since it openened), you can follow people and get emails when they're streaming
23:27:37 <reification> i do but i don’t have your stream :(
23:28:01 <CockRoach|42> :<
23:28:38 <CockRoach|42> it was just dirty things, so nothing that would've interested any of you (:

23:38:01 <reification> i’m not sure why you need to send an email for that…
23:38:49 <Bio> my thoughts
23:38:53 <Camail> oh hey pornhub released their yearly dataset
23:38:56 <Camail> that's always a fun read
23:38:58 <Bio> noice
23:39:11 <Bio> saw on overwatch reddit that overwatch was 11th searched term
23:39:16 <reification> overwatch is up there can
23:39:18 <reification> *cam
23:39:38 <Camail> on the global rankings its pretty high, yea
23:40:27 <Camail> lol, on the us rankings overwatched jumps 452 spots from where it was in 2015
23:40:39 <Camail> which means that there are either 460-ish keywords
23:40:50 <Camail> or there was at least SOME of it in 2015 in the us
23:41:05 <Camail> those porn guys are on the cutting edge of trends, sometimes
23:41:25 <reification> there’s gonna be more keywords than that 
23:41:43 <reification> it’s what drives tech cam
23:41:45 <Camail> yea i was almost being rhetorical
23:42:01 <Camail> it hasnt been as influential since we stopped using physical media
23:42:50 <reification> yeah if ppl aren’t paying…
23:42:54 <Camail> I can see a cd, but i can't tell how a video is encoded
23:42:56 <Camail> in general
23:43:24 <Camail> even if you pay for porn most of the tech advancement isn't gonna be visible to the end user anymore, other than DL speeds
23:43:52 <reification> well i did download the first bittorrent file :p
