00:16:35 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpb3zZQNocE
01:04:11 <Camail> man, the story lines in e sports this weekend
01:04:16 <Camail> have been REAL good
01:04:32 <Camail> fairy tale weekend
01:07:29 <DuB`> juuuuuri
01:14:49 <DuB`> Maaan
01:14:49 <Camail> technically, shroud won a major
01:14:52 <Camail> not on active roster
01:15:03 <Camail> but he is still under contract for the professional csgo team c9
01:15:08 <DuB`> I'm not really supposed to eat solid food but I feel pretty ok right now and I'm staaaarving
01:15:12 <DuB`> lol
01:15:13 <Camail> dub
01:15:15 <Camail> fucking dont
01:15:23 <Camail> it will fuck your colon in like 5 hours
01:15:35 <DuB`> My organs are only bleeding a LITTLE BIT :P
01:15:42 <DuB`> Yeah yeah, ramen 'n chicken noodle...
01:16:08 <Dot`> dub, they really dont tell you that kind of stuff for no reason
01:17:13 <Dot`> dont be an idiot
01:17:20 <DuB`> o fine
01:17:32 <DuB`> I'm gonna overdose on salt with all this canned stuff though lol
01:18:04 <Dot`> just liquadise a pizza
01:22:31 <Camail> dub you did so much cardio your heart was too healthy
01:22:35 <Camail> we gotta harden that heart
01:22:40 <Camail> keep the blood out
01:23:11 <Dot`> we should drain his blood
01:23:21 <Camail> the old cures
01:23:24 <DuB`> That's what caused the problem in the first place!
01:26:27 <DuB`> I was doing so well on my exercise goal and now I just have to sit around for a week+ :(

01:44:37 <Camail> lmao everyone is talking about that b set up
01:44:54 <Camail> basically "thank god they won or else stewie would hate himself"
01:49:57 <Camail> they will 100% never run that strat again
01:50:17 <Camail> that was a "we're on fire we can out aim them and put them in the grinder"
01:50:32 <Camail> they out aimed but not THAT much
01:50:54 <Camail> they over estimated their individual skill in compared to essentially 4 of the top 10 in terms of aim
01:51:47 <Camail> which is fair, you have to commit to that strat without a whole lot of thought behind it, but its was still really dumb

02:00:15 <Camail> interesting, csgo hit 1.1m on twitch, which broke the record for a single stream
02:00:19 <Camail> csgo > league
02:00:51 <DuB`> Way hype, more watchable
02:00:51 <DuB`> ez
02:14:39 <Camail> I tried not to watch the radar as much, usually I'm not even watching the game
02:15:04 <Camail> also its good practice to take a mental snapshot and let the information process while refocusing on the crosshair
02:23:21 <Camail> still riding this high
02:24:04 <Camail> dub i wish you could really appreciate how godlike that juri play from infiltration was
02:41:27 <DuB`> I just skimmed for now and bookmarked, will watch more later
