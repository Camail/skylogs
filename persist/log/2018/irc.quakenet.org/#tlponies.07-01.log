00:29:26 <Cane> skram, I know, how ridiculous is that thing?
00:29:48 <skram> its ludicrous, cane
00:30:09 <Cane> Wow, when I linked that article/video, the video had like 50k views.
00:30:14 <Cane> 1,4m now.
00:30:15 <skram> this boy here going through gears like he's got stock in the machining firm that made them
00:30:36 <Cane> Just look at his helmet. Dude's getting bounced around like mad.
00:31:13 <skram> wish there was an accelorometer gauge on screen
00:31:27 <Cane> Oh god yeah, this overlay needs a G meter.
00:32:04 <Cane> That part at 2:45, it looks like he's gonna go airborne at any second.
00:32:09 <Cane> How that thing stays on the ground I do not know.
00:32:40 <skram> turns out big ass spoilers matter when you're doing 350 km/h
00:32:51 <Cane> You don't say.jpg
00:34:45 <Cane> I like how the car immediately caps out at 367 for the straight and just stays there.
00:35:05 <skram> haha
00:35:14 <skram> i wonder how many G's that thing pulls on acceleration
00:37:23 <Cane> That thing accelerates from 230 to 369 like a normal car goes from 0 to 100.
00:37:28 <Cane> What in the fuck is even happening.
00:41:28 <skram> i dont know Cane
00:42:34 <skram> its got a 720hp v4 and 440 hp of electric motors but it doesnt say how big its batteries are
00:42:43 <skram> but presumably enough for a lap of the nurburgring  :P
00:43:22 <Cane> Stupid hybrids, with their cheating engines and shit.
00:43:33 <Cane> Electric engines accelerate like nothing else on the planet.
00:43:57 <skram> yeah their torque curve is just a vertical line
00:44:01 <skram> horizontal
00:44:01 <skram> i mean
00:46:42 <Bio> pone
00:48:23 <Phearlock__> Electric engines, acceleration, pfft.
00:48:25 <Phearlock__> A rocket
00:48:28 <Phearlock__> That's what you want
00:48:56 <skram> rocket engines are flawed phearlock
00:49:09 <skram> im just waiting for nasa to develop the EM drive or something
00:49:15 <Phearlock__> Combustion engines have small explosions. Rockets are big explosions
00:49:26 <Phearlock__> Same thing really
00:54:01 <Cane> Clearly the best method of propulsion is the GAU-8 Avenger autocannon from the A-10 Warthog.
00:54:07 <Cane> Would liven things up at Le Mans a bit.

00:54:41 <skram> noone's gonna try to take advantage of your slipstream again thats for sure
00:54:50 <Cane> Oh hey, yeah, bonus.
00:55:11 <skram> overtaking is gonna be pretty risky too
00:55:37 <Cane> And cornering is gonna kill a couple of spectators.

03:49:58 <Camail> depends on the kind, for me
03:50:16 <Camail> paintball in the woods and big games were meh
03:52:24 <Camail> and i really hated getting shot so that eventually made me quit all together
03:54:20 <Cane> I've seen YouTube videos of first person footage/scope footage of paintball wars. It seems like it's a lot of running around the woods and getting shot by people you don't see.

21:14:03 <Camail> runbun pls dont choke
21:15:11 <Dot> i have considered runnign an ethernet through the house rather than the EoP i currently use
21:15:31 <Dot> it just drops randomly for a second and only really effects IRC
21:18:54 <Camail> i thought eop was using an ethernet cord that also had power
21:19:02 <Camail> i dont see why a dedicated ethernet would be better
21:19:16 <Camail> those 4 pins arent being used anyway
21:19:32 <Dot> PoE is power over ethernet
21:19:38 <Dot> used for like viop phones and stuff
21:20:33 <Dot> EoP is ethernet over power, where you pretty much turn the wall sockets into ethernet points
21:21:10 <Dot> but then it has to contend with power in the lines, which is normaly fine, but can be spotty depending on the house
21:25:25 <Bio> yo cane
21:25:28 <Cane> <3
21:26:06 <Bio> whats the happy happenin
21:28:15 <Camail> clearly you just need to plug a batter into your house
