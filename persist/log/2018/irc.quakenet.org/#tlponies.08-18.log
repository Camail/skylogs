08:17:38 <Dot`> morning all
08:19:03 <Dot`> camail, its ither stadard array, roll 4d6 drop then place as you want or I roll 3 sets of 4d6 drop and you all can pick from those sets
08:19:41 <Camail> I'm good with the second
08:21:21 <Dot`> now do we use the matt colville, reroll if you dont get at least 2 15's, or roll 3 sets and pick one
08:21:29 <Dot`> or if you get less than 70 on point buy
08:21:37 <Dot`> i think 70 was the number
08:23:28 <Camail> the 15's seems way too strong
08:24:46 <Camail> anyway, your the dm, you decide
08:25:13 <Dot`> just roll and i will look and see how it is then

22:34:02 <Zoonds> muh Crisium 
22:34:07 <Zoonds> how was the battlefield treating you
22:34:15 <Zoonds> that game makes me feel like a blind idiot 90% of the time
22:34:16 <Crisium> stalker!
22:34:22 <Zoonds> Don't blame me blame discord
22:34:34 <Crisium> yeah the visual clutter makes it impossible to see enemies it seems like
22:34:39 <Crisium> thats why they put spotting in i guess
22:34:47 <Dot`> though you should just play STALKER
22:34:48 <Zoonds> BF5 looks to be the same way
22:35:12 <Crisium> ya im not sure if i'll get 5
22:35:14 <Zoonds> Amazing graphics, mind blowing sound design
22:35:19 <Zoonds> shitty gameplay
22:35:24 <Crisium> they trying to make it fortnite
22:35:31 <Crisium> you can build things in the game lol
22:35:39 <Dot`> BF5 is just going to dissapoint me
22:35:39 <Crisium> customizing appearance
22:35:47 <Crisium> ya im not expecting greatness
22:36:02 <Zoonds> Bad Company 2 was good
22:36:06 <Zoonds> the player models were large
22:36:16 <Zoonds> didn't blend in so much
22:36:19 <Crisium> BF2 and BC2 were both fine
22:36:25 <Crisium> it was BF3 that made it too hard to see
22:36:50 <Zoonds> Yeah, you really are more likely to be shooting the red dorito than anything you can actually see
22:37:08 <Dot`> push q all day in non-HC
22:37:14 <Crisium> yup
22:37:49 <Dot`> actualy, it worked in HC too didnt it?
22:37:57 <Crisium> only on the map
22:38:03 <Dot`> oh yea

22:38:11 <Dot`> i recalled there was SOME reason for marking
22:38:22 <Dot`> though no one ever did :/
22:40:35 <Zoonds> Dunno if you guys ever played bad company 1 since it was console exclusive
22:40:41 <Zoonds> motion spotters were just plain hilarious in that one
22:40:41 <Crisium> i did not
22:41:00 <Zoonds> it gave you real time tracking on the 3d map in a huge area
22:41:06 <Zoonds> so you could see through walls pretty much
22:41:15 <Zoonds> sniper boys still didn't throw them ^^
22:41:24 <Dot`> lol
22:42:15 <Zoonds> Takes too much time from staring down your scope while your team loses the point behind you

22:48:10 <Camail> Dot`  who is the third player, i only know about skramboi
22:49:20 <Dot`> pear clock
22:49:46 <Dot`> hey zounds, you want to try dnd sometime?
22:59:41 <Zoonds> not at this time sorry
22:59:52 <Zoonds> I have trouble forming a consistent schedule

23:49:54 <Dot`> np zounds, sometime then, its a west marches style dnd game, so everytime we play we can swap ppl out
23:49:58 <Dot`> there is no set party
