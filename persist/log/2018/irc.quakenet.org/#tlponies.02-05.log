06:33:37 <Cane> DuB`, it's such a fun genre. =)
06:33:51 <Cane> The Sierra "Quest" games have a certain appeal
06:34:08 <Cane> I started strong though, Quest for Glory is my favorite of them all.
06:34:25 <Cane> King's Quest is the mainstream one but apart from KQ3, that may be my least favorite.

22:18:08 <Runbunny> O:
22:18:28 <Runbunny> Is it the Malazan book of the fallen?
22:18:41 <Dot`> no, Stormlight archive
22:18:52 <Dot`> I never did finish Malazan
22:19:21 <Dot`> that was really bad in how it loved jumping to a whole new set of 50 new people in the middle of sometihng
22:19:32 <Dot`> and then a book later maybe talking about who they are
22:19:43 <DuB`> I don't think I ever made it through the first book.
22:19:58 <Dot`> it got more jumpy dub
22:20:06 <Dot`> 2nd book never even touched on anyone from the first
22:20:17 <Dot`> then third went back to them a bit
22:20:22 <Runbunny> O:
22:20:28 <DuB`> ...
22:20:29 <DuB`> Yikes
22:20:32 <Runbunny> It's neat!
22:20:45 <Runbunny> Like you hear about a group of people in like book 4
22:20:59 <Runbunny> probably 5
22:21:08 <Runbunny> Then you hear about them again in book 9
22:21:25 <DuB`> But there's no way I'd remember so it'd be pointless!
22:22:10 <Runbunny> Sure there is
22:22:39 <Runbunny> One of the guys punched another guy in the face and broke his neck
22:22:42 <Runbunny> It was super cool.
22:22:51 <Runbunny> How could I forget.
22:24:23 <Dot`> how could you?!
