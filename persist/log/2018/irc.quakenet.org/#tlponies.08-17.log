12:30:29 <Dot`> skram, any thoughts on character yet?
12:31:36 <skram> hmm
12:31:40 <skram> i might make a dwarf
12:31:46 <Dot`> really?
12:31:50 <Dot`> might it be an angry one?
12:31:58 <skram> possibly
12:32:18 <skram> are we starting from level 1
12:32:22 <Dot`> cam was thinking of a fighter
12:32:45 <Dot`> i dont know yet, its one of the thing i want to talk about, becuase its meant to be really deadly and stuff 
12:32:51 <Dot`> and traditionaly its a lvl 1 start
12:32:54 <Dot`> buuut
12:33:06 <Dot`> i was thinking of lvl 3
12:33:27 <Dot`> i just have to up the encounter tables i make
12:33:55 <skram> might do another cleric actually
12:34:27 <Dot`> tempest cleric is pretty strong
12:36:56 <Dot`> if you are looking at clerics dont forget that the arcana domain exists in SCAG

12:48:00 <Dot`> when they cant carry 10 days rations
12:48:43 <Rawr|Fone> Can they not carry it with magic
12:49:31 <Dot`> there are ways, but it uses spell slots that they then cant use for anytihng else that day
12:49:41 <Dot`> and its a trade off

21:30:09 <skram> did you know that you can get free version of windows 10
21:30:43 <Dot`> i had heard that
21:30:52 <Dot`> i already had a pirated one, which is also free
21:30:54 <skram> theres even a program that downloads it and puts it on a bootable usb drive for you
21:31:25 <skram> i purchased a legit version when i got this
21:31:49 <skram> first time ive run a legit windows
21:32:21 <Dot`> is it all working now?
21:33:03 <skram> probably
21:34:56 <skram> Dot`: https://www.finn.no/realestate/homes/ad.html?finnkode=126479105
21:35:07 <skram> should i make an offer on this or wait until i can afford something with an indoor pool
21:36:44 <Dot`> this is a nice house
21:36:58 <Dot`> and you can always dig a basement and then dig further to make a pool

21:42:20 <Dot`> how dies it make you feel skram
21:43:01 <skram> sad i guess
21:43:25 <Dot`> is a family house normal? from american things it seems like houses get passed down
21:43:40 <skram> not really
21:44:12 <Dot`> my parents moved three times then we moved agian when my dad left and now i moved to england
21:44:22 <Dot`> so never really had sometihng liek that
21:44:52 <Camail> usually people in the US have a childhood home, but not a generational home
21:45:24 <Camail> we have enough land that suburbs are always growing with new parents who buy a home to raise kids in
21:45:43 <Camail> and typically stay in the same school system for all 12 years
21:45:55 <skram> same
21:46:12 <skram> houses are hella expensive dot
