00:46:42 <reification> night all
02:07:10 <Camail> dub still ded?
02:07:27 <DuB`> Was never ded!
02:07:31 <DuB`> 'Bout the same as yesterday.
02:08:05 <Camail> you were a little ded
02:08:27 <Camail> if you cant eat solid food you are either recently born or about to die
02:08:32 <Camail> no in between
02:08:35 <DuB`> o
02:08:49 <DuB`> Aren't we all just a little bit dead?
02:09:48 <Camail> also, do you think sam and laura being seated near each other is affecting how much interaction their characters are having
02:10:07 <Camail> it cant be entirely by accident
02:10:53 <DuB`> Either way it's IDEAL
02:11:18 <Camail> yea I'm a fan of the chemistry
02:11:41 <Camail> and i kinda hated the bo vs molly stuff at first but now I'm interested
02:12:03 <Camail> i honestly have no idea where bo is as a character, her traits are mostly centered around apathy
02:13:19 <Camail> we know fjord has some magical aspirations, caleb is a non-functional alcoholic but without the booze and more books, molly is meh
02:13:29 <Camail> taliesan is having a real hard time with the accent so far
02:13:49 <DuB`> Yeah haha
02:26:17 <Bio> bo is probably my least fave, probably because the voice reminds me of stoners
02:27:08 <Bio> also cam listened to the end of c9's glorious win on twitch audio only
02:27:15 <Bio> sheda patriotic tear
02:27:27 <Camail> i'm not crying, you're crying. shut up
02:27:32 <Camail> was great
02:27:55 <DuB`> ska's not crying, smix was crying
02:28:02 <Bio> when was the last time NA CS won a big tourney?
02:28:05 <DuB`> (everyone was crying)
02:28:11 <Bio> never?
02:28:37 <Bio> muffled "Whaddup now sweedes, WOOOO" in the distance
02:29:02 <DuB`> :P
02:31:11 <Camail> ummm
02:31:23 <Camail> on a world scale? i dunno if it's happened
02:31:43 <Camail> non-majors, I'm sure within the last few years it's happened
02:31:53 <Camail> but not one with the top 3 teams
02:36:25 <Bio> that faze team was stacked too
03:12:10 <Camail> its kinda funny that most faze fans are like "x player didnt perform like a god like usual"
03:12:58 <Camail> like, 1. LuL and 2. if you rely purely on individual performance then this is what happens
