14:42:23 <Dot`> skrm, there is no halflinf language on the internet D:
14:48:46 <skrm> well what actual language are closest to what you think halfling language is
14:48:55 <skrm> its probably danish
14:49:25 <Dot`> haha
14:49:38 <Dot`> but i see dwarvish as norwegion
14:53:05 <skrm> Its probably gaelic or something
14:53:09 <skrm> full of hard consonants
14:54:41 <skrm> or scottish actually
14:54:50 <skrm> i bet zounds is a dwarf in spirit
14:57:53 <Zounds> They tend to be depicted with scottish accents but norwegian / swedish inspired culture and names
14:59:29 <Zounds> Though they are a fantasy race so I guess you can do whatever you want with them
15:01:03 <Zounds> They don't have to b
15:01:07 <Zounds> be proud and stubborn
15:01:42 <Zounds> I think the only thing they have to be is short
15:04:50 <Zounds> I don't know much about halflings though
15:05:11 <Zounds> Except Tolkeins where they are perfectly suited as rural west midlands folks
15:05:27 <skrm> haha
15:06:27 <skrm> I guess technically you can do whatever you want

17:18:14 <Zounds> you should all be casters
17:23:38 <Bio> i see nothing wrong with this
17:27:54 <Dot`> there is no magics YET
17:28:22 <Dot`> i think we have (in loose ideas) 2 rogues, a ranger, a paladin and a gunslinger
17:28:48 <DuB`> Hehe
17:29:28 <Phearlock> in loose ideas yeah. the rogue idea I have can work for a mage as well. though not for any sort of divine-y caster.
17:30:04 <DuB`> Well my boi HATES magicks :P
17:30:17 <DuB`> Having or not having some in the party would be interesting either way

23:57:31 <DuB`> What'd u do
23:57:38 <Bio> i don't know why, but that statement resonates with me
23:58:55 <Camail> in a single second i completely understood and fixed my memory overflow problem with a single keystroke
23:59:13 <Bio> love it when you find the missing semicolon Kappa
23:59:17 <Camail> and it was all down to a typo in a delimiter i was using
23:59:22 <Camail> it wasn't THAT bad
23:59:45 <Camail> it wasnt a syntax error, but essentially my program was reading an entire filewhen it was supposed to be reading a single line
23:59:54 <Bio> noice
