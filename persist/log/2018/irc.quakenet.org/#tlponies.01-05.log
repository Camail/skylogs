00:06:07 <Dot`> dub halp
00:06:22 <Dot`> 3 of the 5 set items i have got have been backpacks :/
00:08:19 <DuB`> Gimme!
00:08:27 <DuB`> I've only seen one so far and it's amazing
00:09:19 <Camail> lmfao pvp is not real in this game
00:10:38 <Crisium> https://twitter.com/shibacentraI/status/947137265687498752 doge
00:11:17 <Dot`> with a scarf!
00:12:51 <Camail> Dot`  nvm pvp sucks but you get ilvl 275 gear form it
00:13:01 <Camail> even when you get whiped you still get a ton of stuff
00:13:36 <Dot`> cam, i went to buy expansion 1 and 2 today, must have missed the steam sale by like 10 minutes
00:13:47 <Camail> it ended december 2nd
00:13:54 <Dot`> nope
00:14:02 <Camail> oh, wellt hats when the winter sale said it did
00:14:04 <Dot`> i put it in cart, it was on sale
00:14:06 <Camail> well, rip you, i guess
00:14:08 <Dot`> went to have supper
00:14:19 <Dot`> came back to buy and it was off sale
00:15:57 <Camail> getting higher ilevel stuff is easy, but getting the gear you actually want is where the grind comes in, i think
00:16:04 <Camail> because i have like, nothing that i actually want
00:16:14 <Dot`> most end game stuff seems to be stuffed behind dlc
00:16:27 <Camail> yea
00:16:38 <Camail> well, more accuratley
00:16:43 <Camail> the end game IS the dlc
00:16:47 <Crisium> oh, also junkrats mines were nerfed so that they have reduced damage scaling the further away from center of explosion
00:16:51 <Crisium> ya know, like every other splash damage since the beginning of time
00:16:59 <Crisium> possibly slower moving riptire
00:33:44 <Dot`> you should pick a less stressfull game cris pon
00:34:20 <skram> i bet 20 dollarydoos that ill place plat or less cris
00:38:04 <Bio> wood league or bust
00:38:07 <Crisium> wood
00:38:22 <Crisium> Dot` no stress now
00:38:25 <Crisium> today is a blessing
00:38:36 <Crisium> ill actually for real be able to play Ana as main healer again
00:38:55 <Crisium> possibly Moira? i could see Moira-Lucio being a cool combo
00:39:44 <Crisium> Ana still has issues, but as long as i dont get to hear "can we get a mercy" everytime ;)
00:43:08 <DuB`> Roommates are starting to move in
00:43:15 <DuB`> Was nice having the place to ourselves for a week :T
00:43:46 <Crisium> does dub use the royal we?
00:43:49 <Crisium> or are you married
00:45:17 <DuB`> Brother
00:48:46 <Dot`> tier 2
00:50:12 <Dot`> dub, what teir you?
00:52:17 <DuB`> Still 1, at 167 powerthing

00:56:18 <Dot`> duuub
00:56:23 <Dot`> duplicate set item ack pack
00:56:44 <DuB`> Heehee
00:57:07 <DuB`> Oh, I hit tier2 level if I swap the lv29 m44 that's ACTUALLY better than everything else but is plvl30
00:59:08 <Dot`> im getting more set items than yellows now
01:00:55 <Camail> I just did like 3 Last Stand missions and I'm up to 265
01:01:03 <Camail> dub its so free
01:01:27 <Camail> ikr dub that m44 was so good everything else was terrible for awhile
01:02:00 <DuB`> o
01:02:08 <DuB`> I'm still clearing a bunch of normal encounters and sides
01:09:33 <Camail> eh, side missions are meh
01:09:45 <Camail> encounters get you all the wings which is nice, especially for the alst talent
01:10:00 <Camail> but end game stuff get events are what boost you up really really quikly
01:30:03 <Dot`> which i cant do! dam you steam

05:52:50 <Camail> pvp in this game is so useless, for some reason they didnt implement like...iters or rankings
05:53:01 <Camail> there arent enough players to have skill ranks
05:59:20 <Bio> I wish for a new computer chair
05:59:22 <Bio> thoughts?
05:59:44 <DuB`> Go to Staples or somethin
05:59:46 <DuB`> Try some out!
06:00:26 <Bio> but what about those overpriced GAEMER CHAIRS
06:01:07 <DuB`> Pff
06:10:21 <Camail> arent there like 2-3 brands that are actually good?
06:10:39 <Camail> dub have you done the final lmb mission yet
06:11:03 <Camail> thinking about doing that and the dz09 mission
06:11:25 <DuB`> Nope
06:11:28 <Camail> also LMGs are the best weapon in pvp i think
06:11:30 <DuB`> Tomoro
06:11:37 <Camail> cuz of the bonus dmg
06:11:46 <Camail> but i dont think i will ever play pvp again
06:11:53 <Camail> because its just...the worst
06:12:13 <Camail> all they did was take random section of the world map and make them individual maps
