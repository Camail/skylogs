04:09:46 <Bio> def would have if caleb would have attacked
04:09:51 <Bio> yeah mercer just said it
04:10:16 <Micen|Droid> I was hoping. I want to see how the table handles it. 
04:11:14 <Micen|Droid> I know jester has revivify but that's not much. 
04:11:24 <Bio> that and she can't cast it
04:11:28 <Bio> doesn't have the pearl
04:11:49 <Micen|Droid> Oh yeah. 
04:16:19 <Micen|Droid> I just realized it would have made an awesome story beat if Caleb killed no with fire 
04:16:28 <Micen|Droid> Killed bo*
04:16:55 <Bio> extra mental instability
04:19:21 <Camail> she cant cast revivify because she doesnt have the mats
04:19:26 <Camail> so they have no res atm
04:19:37 <Camail> until they get back to town to buy stuff
04:22:42 <Bio> man that was a really melee unfriendly monster
04:22:43 <Bio> love it
04:25:47 <Bio> man o man
