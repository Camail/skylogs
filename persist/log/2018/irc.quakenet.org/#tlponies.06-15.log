00:05:47 <skrm> tell me more about your religion Dot 
00:06:39 <Dot> well its more about the coffee
00:06:53 <Dot> things which go with coffee hover on the fringes
00:07:28 <skrm> so its more of a demi-god
00:08:59 <skrm> Or is it like in norse mythology where coffee is sort of the all father and doughnuts are basically thor
00:09:10 <skrm> loki is both the raisin cookie and the chocolate chip cookie
00:09:25 <Dot> oyu catch on fast
00:24:57 <Camail> pls
00:25:12 <Camail> i need to grind a bit in dauntless, i want to make a good axe
00:36:44 <Camail> ugh, patch
00:42:22 <DuB`> I DID avoid the donut shop temptation!
00:42:38 <DuB`> ... but only because the grocery store had a sale on ice cream so I got a bunch of that instead. ;D
00:43:28 <skrm> good lad
00:44:47 <Camail> it takes 100 million years to verify a 5mb patch
00:54:58 <DuB`> LAG might end the season in 3rd overall, after starting badly in stage 1 and being in 8th of 12 :o
01:02:17 <Camail> is 0-40 real
01:02:34 <DuB`> O yeah
01:02:41 <Camail> good
01:02:55 <DuB`> 0-39
01:03:05 <DuB`> Last game is against a weak team, but that shouldn't matter :P
01:05:56 <Camail> they are the weakest, so it shouldn't matter
01:06:18 <Camail> has anyone done any stats on who the worst choker on the team is
01:06:35 <Camail> like, whose stats tank in a tied match
01:07:08 <DuB`> I haven't seen it
01:07:12 <Camail> boo
01:07:19 <Camail> i want someone to get real sad
01:08:18 <Camail> dub
01:08:21 <Camail> critrul
01:08:24 <Camail> in 1 hour
01:08:29 <Camail> 52 minutes, even
01:08:32 <Camail> r u rdy
01:08:40 <DuB`> o ya
01:08:43 <Camail> my prediction, jester does a cute thing
01:08:49 <Camail> then kiri does an even cuter thing
01:08:50 <DuB`> Got snacks 'n ice cream 'n all that
01:09:02 <DuB`> Solid prediction, would not bet against
01:09:06 <Camail> then vecna
01:09:10 <DuB`> wtf are they going to do with kiri though lol
01:09:20 <Camail> raise her, duh
01:09:39 <Camail> not gonna lie, i think she's basically an adult
01:09:43 <DuB`> Mercer just wanted to have a character in the party all along
01:09:45 <Camail> so like... i dunno
01:09:58 <Camail> he just wanted to do their voices
01:10:06 <Camail> i like when he first did Bo's
01:10:17 <DuB`> "... is my voice that low?"
01:10:18 <Camail> and marisha was like "damn, is my voice that low?"
01:10:22 <DuB`> hehehe
01:10:25 <DuB`> "Yeah, kinda"
01:10:36 <Camail> that was some introspection right there
01:11:49 <Camail> i do enjoy how they can only parrot spoken words, but they can also understand the concepts behind them
01:12:11 <Camail> if she really wants to say something she can write it down, or stab corpses with morse code
01:12:37 <Camail> but can also turn their words around on them

21:56:07 <skram> you can help me pick bits for my new computation machine
21:56:13 <skram> hello krisiminium
21:56:40 <Dot> i dont know pc bits anymore
21:56:49 <skram> yeah me neither
21:57:00 <DuB`> Ya want my bits list? :P
21:57:49 <DuB`> Also Crisium reification skram Micen Runbunny anyone OW stack sometime?
21:57:57 <DuB`> Been a while
21:58:00 <Crisium> i am up for this
21:58:13 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
21:58:37 <skram> I can get a pre-build i7/1080 rig with windows bundled for 20.000 king haralds and a can get parts for almost the same thing for 18.000 king haralds (without windowers)
21:59:46 <DuB`> 1080 weee
21:59:48 <Crisium> is the second one counting OS?
21:59:56 <skram> no
22:00:04 <Crisium> would you need to pay for 1?
22:00:21 <skram> yeah so its another 1000 king haralds or more
22:01:13 <Crisium> is there good warranty on the pre buld
22:01:20 <skram> 3 years
22:01:50 <Crisium> 3 years parts, or full replacement, and all shipping costs?
22:02:43 <skram> dont know
22:03:08 <Crisium> may want to find out the details, see reviews
22:03:28 <Crisium> if the reviews for the store are solid, and the case is good enough, then I would favour the pre-build unless you're one of those nerds who likes the satisfaction of plugging components in
22:04:04 <skram> well its a custom build right, i choose parts and they put it together and send it to me
22:09:54 <skram> i think im gonna do the it
22:10:00 <skram> wanna look at the parts list?
22:10:15 <Crisium> sure mang
22:11:07 <DuB`> Then OW! :P

22:12:51 <Crisium> doesnt say RAM speed
22:13:41 <Crisium> and the only storage is a 256gb SSD?
22:14:24 <skram> reusing my old drives and ram is 2666
22:16:16 <Crisium> 8700 isnt as ez to OC as 8700k if you care about that, just cause you cant change the multiplayer
22:16:39 <skram> i have not cared about overclocking for the past 15 years and probably wont this time either :P
22:17:24 <Crisium> dont you already have an i7 and a gtx 970? or am i thinking of someone else
22:17:43 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:18:18 <skram> i got an i5 from 2012 and a 1070
22:18:21 <skram> gonna sell it probably
22:18:49 <Crisium> i5 3570k?
22:19:11 <skram> 3450
22:20:03 <Crisium> unless you want to wait for next gen nvidia rumoured to come out around August (but only rumours)
22:20:52 <skram> August is TOO LONG!
22:21:10 <Crisium> not like your current build is shite or anything mate
22:22:33 <skram> yeah its been alright
22:25:00 <Crisium> the gtx 1170 or 2070 or w/e it will be called will beat the 1080 and be cheaper... whenever it comes out

22:25:55 <skram> wonder if I can do VR stuff with this ...
22:26:02 <skram> ah whatever, im doing the it cris and you cant stop me
22:27:05 <Golly> i miss the old days of just upgrading your pc cheaply
22:27:10 <Crisium> it's your funeral
22:27:32 <Crisium> i think the CPU upgrade is significant, but in anything GPU bound you are gonna be like 20%-25% faster tops
22:27:40 <Bio> i did it skrm
22:27:43 <Bio> i won the dotes
22:27:47 <skram> 20% faster
22:27:48 <skram> hnnng
22:27:57 <skram> grats bio! I know you could do it.
22:27:57 <Crisium> i mean, thats how much faster the 1080 is
22:28:08 <Dot> first world right there 
22:28:11 <Crisium> the better CPU will help a lot, but not every game is all im saying
22:28:42 <skram> Yeah, I understand
22:29:15 <skram> im not gonna hold you accountable for my questionable descisions crisium :p
22:29:20 <Crisium> lol
22:43:51 <Crisium> so no OW I guess?
