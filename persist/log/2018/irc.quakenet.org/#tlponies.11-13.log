07:59:36 <DoT|Phone> it's raining again
07:59:46 <DoT|Phone> in England??
08:00:11 <skram> No way!!
08:01:13 <DoT|Phone> how are you doing Skram
08:01:27 <skram> im alright
08:01:55 <skram> im off tomorrow for two whole days of !FUN! at some dinky hotel somewhere to talk about safety stuff
08:02:05 <DoT|Phone> oh boy
08:02:26 <DoT|Phone> I hope you have been saving all those gifs I send you with ppl being safe
08:02:54 <skram> Oh yeah i've been hoarding cat gifs for months
08:04:49 <DoT|Phone> you will be the most popular horse there
08:07:07 <skram> Ill probably be the grumpiest horse because this is just a massive fucking waste of time and money
08:07:30 <DoT|Phone> it always is
08:07:50 <DoT|Phone> but not your money at least
08:09:13 <skram> Nah and im being paid overtime
08:09:42 <skram> ...Which again is a stupid waste of money because I could easily do this certification online during work hours
08:11:30 <DoT|Phone> what a diligent worker you see Skram
08:12:16 <DoT|Phone> are*
08:14:33 <skram> I just dont like arrogance dot
08:14:36 <skram> which is what this is really
08:15:11 <DoT|Phone> how so?
08:16:34 <skram> Well some shirt wearin person decided that people wanna spend their free time with work stuff and team building excersises
08:17:04 <DoT|Phone> ah. management arrogance
08:19:14 <skram> I just wanna do my hours and then go home, DoT|Phone
08:25:16 <DoT|Phone> sounds fair
08:25:45 <DoT|Phone> but at least overtime = more Lego
08:26:12 <skram> I guess
08:26:18 <skram> I still wanna grumble about it though
08:30:18 <DoT|Phone> I expect nothing less
08:33:18 <skram> did you see the pokemon trailer thing
08:34:18 <DoT|Phone> yes
08:34:35 <DoT|Phone> I actually want deeply disturbed by it
08:34:38 <DoT|Phone> wasn't
08:34:51 <skram> It looks great
08:35:41 <skram> it just seems like its a prank
08:35:41 <DoT|Phone> I expected something really really awful when I heard about it
08:36:01 <DoT|Phone> but the trailer was surprising
08:36:02 <skram> because its fucking LIVE ACTION POKEMON with DEADPOOL playing pikachu
08:37:03 <DoT|Phone> haha. that voice from pikachu was unexpected
08:40:47 <DoT|Phone> I'm going to get curtain rails this weekend Skram!
08:41:00 <skram> ah hell yeah
08:41:34 <skram> did you decide on curtains yet
08:41:58 <DoT|Phone> I bought curtains weeks ago
08:42:10 <skram> very good
08:42:23 <CockRoach|42> are there there colorful horses on the curtains?
08:42:29 <DoT|Phone> lounge has sage curtains. to go with the dark wood beams
08:43:33 <skram> VERY tasteful
08:44:44 <skram> Get some gd white phalaenopsises in the window sill and its gonna be cozy as f r i c k
08:45:15 <CockRoach|42> skram dropping them fancy words
08:45:49 <skram> son im v v good at flowers
08:45:55 <skram> i know the names of several

08:47:54 <DoT|Phone> what
08:47:58 <DoT|Phone> snela
08:48:00 <CockRoach|42> skram so rude
08:48:37 <skram> well the wikipedia picture was a sad bush
08:49:10 <skram> they are brightly colored pine cones
08:49:11 <skram> neat
08:49:27 <DoT|Phone> http://imgur.com/gallery/O7aD4
08:50:05 <DoT|Phone> also about the size of my face
08:50:14 <DoT|Phone> pretty large pine cones
08:50:21 <skram> gonna need a big flower pot then i reckon
08:51:01 <DoT|Phone> did you see the pics Skram. they open up
08:51:08 <DoT|Phone> like a normal flower
08:51:16 <skram> i guess
08:59:03 <CockRoach|42> skram is not impressed
08:59:13 <DoT|Phone> so Skram. when I run a DnD module between bio's 2 Dragon ones you going to play a  elephant man?
08:59:25 <skram> yes
08:59:27 <DoT|Phone> Skram is just being grouchy
08:59:59 <skram> ive been working all night ok
09:00:01 <skram> cut me some slack
09:00:41 <DoT|Phone> I will probably run the new one. Waterdeep: Dragon Heist. that's lvl 1-5. so won't take too long
09:01:26 <DoT|Phone> and then after bio's Tiamat I will move onto storm kings thunder
09:01:34 <DoT|Phone> using those characters
09:01:50 <skram> https://i.imgur.com/RwvCuLN.jpg
09:02:08 <skram> thats a pretty long term plan dot
09:02:10 <DoT|Phone> haha
09:02:14 <DoT|Phone> it is
09:02:16 <skram> but im into it
09:02:52 <DoT|Phone> but I wanted a loose plan to continue using those characters past lvl 5
09:03:09 <skram> yeah sounds good
09:03:16 <skram> I miss my cleric actually
09:03:36 <DoT|Phone> could be an elephant cleric
09:04:18 <skram> I guess but cleric is useless until like level 4
09:04:38 <DoT|Phone> healing word is always amazing
09:04:44 <DoT|Phone> and toll
09:04:57 <DoT|Phone> though after 4 they do get really good
09:04:57 <skram> fingerguns
09:04:58 <skram> yes
09:07:34 <DoT|Phone> I still can't believe you pretty much soloed a Dragon
09:07:52 <skram> hahah

20:29:17 <Zounds> what vidya are you playing these days if any Phearlock 
20:30:37 <Phearlock> Well lets see. Picked up From the depths again for a bit. Building boats, subs, airships, that sort of fun thing. Still have Starsector as my stand-by for relaxing space game.
20:30:48 <Phearlock> Picked up slay the spire as well recently and that's been fun.
20:30:57 <reification> is a good game
20:31:08 <Phearlock> And still play the occasional mechwarrior session
20:31:32 <Zounds> hm I should join you for some of those
20:31:35 <Phearlock> Waiting for the DCS:F-14 to get back into flight sims, and might poke at X4 when that's out later this month
20:31:44 <Zounds> haven't played much MWO myself lately but not for any particular reason
20:31:48 <Zounds> games still gud
20:32:29 <Phearlock> It goes up and down. The faster heat dissipation has been nice for a lot of mech builds.
20:32:40 <Phearlock> 2ERPPC shadowcat isn't insanely hot anymore
20:32:55 <Zounds> My annhilator might be good for more than 2 shots a match
20:33:11 <Zounds> could be 3 shots even
20:33:21 <Phearlock> =P
20:34:26 <Phearlock> Anyway, pillars of eternity 2 tonight for me. figured it was time for a second playthrough =P
20:35:04 <Zounds> gl pon <3
20:37:21 <BioPhone> You should play eve apparently me and dub are doing that ðŸ˜‹
20:37:41 <Phearlock> Eve is scary
20:39:18 <BioPhone> Nah, it's fine. Just be ignorant of everything like me and its gucci
20:39:24 <BioPhone> ðŸ¤£
20:40:21 <BioPhone> Put 7 turrents on a space boat and giggle while blowing ships up in a rain of bullet
20:40:57 <DuB`> I think I'm gonna connect a 2nd account just so I can put a new character into a quick little ship to follow me around and loot
20:41:12 <DuB`> SO MUCH wreckage in L4 missions
20:44:30 <Phearlock> Bio you're hanging out with a multiboxer.
20:44:50 <Phearlock> Be careful, he might get to a point where he may no longer need you.
20:44:55 <DuB`> :P
20:45:07 <Dot> dub going to end up like that wow player with 16 screens
20:45:19 <DuB`> Hey if bio wants to fly into L4's and shoot annoying frigates for me, he's free to all the wreckage loot...
20:45:42 <DuB`> Got 7m worth of dog tags in the one last night!
20:50:27 <Phearlock> If X4 ends up being dissapointing I might give EVE a shot for that space game fix.
20:51:03 <DuB`> I was watching for X4 too, haven't played one of the series before but it looked like lots of what I like by the description
20:52:31 <skram> will you be my sugar daddy if i do eve DuB`
20:52:45 <Phearlock> Yeah I tried X3 back in the day but never got into it.
20:53:17 <Phearlock> But will give X4 a good solid shot as I do want some new space game to dump some hours into
20:56:13 <Camail> dub just got re-obsessed with eve
20:56:26 <Camail> you should play that to feed his addiction
20:57:53 <Phearlock> He mentioned it. I will consider it =)
20:58:49 <Camail> asscreed's parry window is the largest in the history of gaming
20:59:01 <Camail> it's like... half a second
20:59:09 <Camail> maybe even 3/4ths
21:01:07 <DuB`> Of course, skram :P
21:02:38 <Phearlock> That's a pretty big window
21:02:53 <DuB`> Bio the first last name that came up on the randomizer for my alt was Austrene :P
21:02:57 <DuB`> ONE BIG FAMILY
21:03:44 <Zounds> i can stack ow now whenever one gets going
21:03:54 <Zounds> where's crissy boy at
21:09:38 -!- BioPhone [~androirc@12.33.239.117] has joined #tlponies
21:11:04 <Camail> Phearlock  the only saving grace is that there are unparryables that you have to react to
21:12:18 <Phearlock> Alright, that puts it at like, use at least 3 buttons for combat? That's better than 2
21:21:46 <BioPhone> Dub we are basically space brothers
21:24:50 <Camail> dark souls has definitely made AAA games less shit, as a whole
21:25:04 <Camail> that truly is fromsoft's lasting impact
