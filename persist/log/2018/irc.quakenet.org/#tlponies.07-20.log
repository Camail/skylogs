07:28:00 <Dot`> micen
07:30:23 <Cane> Dot`. <3
07:30:30 <Dot`> Hey cane <3
07:30:38 <Cane> How's things?
07:31:05 <Dot`> having coffee, just woke up
07:31:12 <Dot`> will know in about 30 minutes
07:31:15 <Dot`> you?
07:31:26 <Cane> Same problem but I've been awake for an hour and a half.
07:31:44 <Cane> Lack of sleep lately
07:31:50 <Dot`> too hot?
07:32:30 <Cane> Among other things, yeah.
07:32:36 <Cane> Norway is colder today and it's wonderful. <3
07:33:58 <Dot`> yea im managing about 4 hours proper sleep, then just keep waking up 3 nights ina row now
07:34:01 <Dot`> lack of sleep sucks
07:34:06 <Cane> Yeah. =/
07:34:21 <Cane> Trying to be productive in the heat.
07:34:42 <Dot`> ah, the South African struggle
07:35:35 <Cane> Was it an African dude who said air conditioning is the single greatest invention with regards to productivity?
07:35:43 <Cane> I know I can't even focus if it gets too hot.
07:35:48 <Cane> And that's like... Norway hot.
07:35:51 <Cane> I can't imagine California hot.
07:36:41 <Cane> https://i.redd.it/175xdtq2hya11.jpg
07:36:43 <Dot`> the worst was about 2 weeks every summer when it would be in the high 30's 
07:36:58 <Dot`> then at night it would drop to about 28
07:37:04 <Cane> How do people survive?
07:37:12 <Dot`> and th walls inside the house where still warm to the touch
07:37:28 <Cane> I stay indoors at ~30 and I still feel like my brain is gonna melt. Zero productivity and 3-5 hours of sleep for days.
07:37:44 <Cane> It took me almost a day to REMEMBER I HAVE ICE CREAM and how good it tastes on days like that.
07:37:51 <Dot`> haha
07:38:14 <Cane> Pasty white Norwegians tend to have a... difficult relationship with the sun.
07:38:37 <Dot`> im happy with like 24 degrees
07:38:55 <Dot`> i have had some fun seeing all the burnt english ppl
07:39:01 <Dot`> they go all obster
07:39:05 <Dot`> lobster*
07:39:31 <Cane> That'd be me, only paler and not stupid enough to go outdoors.
07:40:51 <Dot`> Being hot is awefull, its very hard to cool down
07:43:02 <Cane> And then I did something stupid yesterday while I was cleaning..
07:43:13 <Cane> The vacuum must have bumped the heat switch next to my bathroom and put it up to 3.
07:43:17 <Cane> It was a fucking sauna this morning.
07:43:27 <Dot`> oh god
07:43:29 <Cane> Thanks, I needed that.
07:44:02 <Cane> 3 isn't even a "dead of winter" setting, 2 is enough.
07:44:03 <Cane> So yeah.
07:44:23 <Cane> I wouldn't trade my heated floors for anything though. <3
07:44:45 <Cane> Best thing about living above the arctic circle is being able to walk around barefoot in the dead of winter and curl your toes agains the floor.
07:44:59 <Dot`> i can only imagine how great heated floors are in winter
07:45:18 <Cane> Can't overstate how nice they can be. =)
07:49:26 <Dot`> very jelous, my feet are always cold
07:53:12 <Dot`> Micen|Droid pls, i want to know who/what talisons new character is
