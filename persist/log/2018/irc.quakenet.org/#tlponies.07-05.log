01:07:55 <Cane> What's holding you back?
01:07:57 <Bio> did pb by 2 mins
01:08:09 <Bio> learning how to route a bit better
01:08:17 <Bio> and fight bosses with low resources
01:08:46 <Bio> this seed was particularly bad, having to double dip 2 crystal dungeons
01:09:09 <Bio> for a single item in each that led to a single item needed, ect
01:09:51 <Bio> and bow was in like the VERY last place I checked
01:10:46 <Cane> So kind of getting buggered by RNG then.
01:17:47 <Bio> a little
01:17:57 <Bio> but certainly not every bit of the blame
01:18:29 <Bio> who knows
01:18:41 <Bio> perhaps i'll try again tomorrow and get a 1:30:00

21:22:15 <skram> and its probably not a driver thing either because I did the dpc test and it turned up no errors
21:26:25 <Runbunny> So it only appears with this one specific headset on and this one specific soundcard?
21:26:46 <skram> no on both
21:32:07 <Runbunny> as in one headset doesn't work on both soundcards or vice versa?

22:12:21 <skram> sometimes you brits are alright
22:13:33 <Dot`> cane, caaaane new "Stalker game" on july 18th,  but its a battle royal
22:13:34 <Dot`> im torn
22:14:28 <Camail> fuckin lul
22:14:42 <Camail> well, honestly if any franchise could do it differently, its stalker
22:14:50 <Camail> like, clearly the circle is radiation
22:15:05 <Camail> and there's a lot you can do with that
22:15:20 <Camail> anomalies, too
22:15:27 <Dot`> yea
22:15:31 <Camail> it's probably unlikely that it will be good, but it COULD be good
22:15:40 <Dot`> its perfect, but its ANOTHER br game
22:15:54 <Dot`> maybe its so late becse its been done right...
22:16:01 <Dot`> i just need more stalker games
22:17:58 <Camail> tbf there's like, 3 br games right now
22:18:07 <Camail> pubg, fortnight, realm royale
22:18:21 <Camail> the others are pretty ignorable upon first glance
22:22:16 <Camail> i'm all for exploring new genres
22:23:04 <Dot`> i just miss Arma 3 BR
22:27:46 <Dot`> Well i hope it does well and STALKER doesnt get relegated to "just another bandwagon game"
22:27:49 <Dot`> we shall see
