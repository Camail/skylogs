04:10:39 <Camail> i think i have a bug in my game and i cant find note of it anywhere else...
04:10:59 <Camail>  i have  a party member one-shotting everything, doing upwards of 10 times the damage he should be doing
04:17:29 <Camail> ok, this isn't even fun to play
04:22:44 <Camail> normally it wouldnt be a problem cuz he's slow, but he has a 50% chance to attack at the beginning of an engagement so he literally brushed up against people and they die

21:17:21 <CockRoach|42> or might've had a patreon
