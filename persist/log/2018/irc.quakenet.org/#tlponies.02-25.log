19:22:31 <DuB`> What a boop baahahahaha
19:23:30 <Dot`> is moira the always pick nowdays?
19:23:34 <Zounds> Reaper should really be an answer to crazy amounts of tanks
19:23:52 <Zounds> But he dies too easily
19:23:54 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
19:24:01 <Crisium> moira is the most used healer at GM, but in OWL its still Lucio/Zen
19:24:36 <Zounds> if you were gonna buff reaper how would you do it pons?
19:25:15 <Crisium> speed buff to wraith
19:25:20 <DuB`> ^
19:25:25 <DuB`> What I was about to say, actually
19:25:31 <Zounds> yeah that could be good
19:25:37 <DuB`> Always feels awful playing reaper now that I'm used to moira
19:25:46 <DuB`> He could actually chase down kills etc with that
19:25:53 <Crisium> its a 30% speed boost for 3 seconds, not that much really
19:26:42 <Dot`> \o/
19:26:43 <Crisium> plut it would let him engage deeper behind lines and be able to wraith away to safety
19:26:46 <Crisium> gj reif
19:26:53 <DuB`> \o/
19:26:56 <Dot`> i go eat now
19:26:59 <Zounds> \o/
19:27:17 <DuB`> Reif 72% kill partic!
19:27:24 <DuB`> OWL-ready
19:28:37 <Zounds> Reaper is also so damned easy to headshot
19:28:54 <Zounds> I think blizzard really didn't pay enough attention to the gameplay implications of their character models
19:29:42 <Crisium> yeah he is ez head shot
19:29:46 <Zounds> Both zen and ana are 0 mobility 200hp healers
19:29:56 <Zounds> one is waaaaaaaaaay harder to kill than the other for tracer

19:30:21 <Zounds> Or at least to hit, both can ofc put up a decent fight :P
19:30:57 <Zounds> yeh reaper has a pretty big head and most importantly it's very stationary when he's running
19:31:09 <Zounds> not like soldier with his teleporting head or zarya with her spasms
19:32:28 <DuB`> I like this Vasher's style
19:32:32 <DuB`> Proper fighter lucio ;D
19:32:54 <DuB`> wow wow wow
19:33:01 <Zounds> they're rolling

19:40:03 <Crisium> lol, well yeah they are coordinated
19:40:09 <Crisium> we would be bopped
19:40:34 <Crisium> just need to do triple turret heroes
19:41:04 <Zounds> I think we could co-ordinate
19:41:13 <Zounds> if we tried a bit :P
19:41:19 <Crisium> not if they pick a Mei
19:41:24 <Zounds> Shhhh

20:26:48 <Dot`> suprise!
20:26:56 <Dot`> :P dub
20:27:44 <Zounds> You'll welome the genjis nowadays dotters
20:27:48 <Zounds> anything better than a fuckin' junkrat
20:28:16 <Dot`> what they do to him? he use to be fun but really not great most of the time
20:28:31 <DuB`> Gave him a second mine thing
20:28:36 <Crisium> and ult moves faster
20:28:38 <Zounds> And his ult moves faster too
20:28:59 <Zounds> I hated junkrat before he was cool
20:30:08 <Zounds> The "I'm a brainlet but want to deal tons of damage randomly" hero of choice
20:30:29 <Zounds> Not to say he can't be played well but a rubbish junkrat is still annoying
20:31:10 <Dot`> yea, i am bad at game, so when i wanted to just not think and have fun lobbing bombs around he was great
20:31:52 <Zounds> I'm totally a hitscan snob though
20:31:55 <Dot`> cane, NS2? https://imgur.com/gallery/EWpv5
20:32:16 <Zounds> But overwatch is not super good for that
20:33:15 <Zounds> Well it's actually brilliant for hitscan because of all the fast moving weirdly shaped targets so its a lot of fun
20:34:46 <Zounds> but being an enthusiast for clicking on guys only gets you so far when it comes to actualy succeeding
20:38:17 <DuB`> Dot`, you could come play junkrat right now!
20:40:22 <Dot`> except i still have these essays to do
20:40:22 <DuB`> And Micen_

23:41:10 <Dot`> this butt right here
23:52:02 <DuB`> Makin' some rice vermicelli mix
23:52:08 <DuB`> Has to simmer for 20 minutes D:
23:52:10 <DuB`> AM HUNGER NOW
23:52:17 <Phearlock> D=
23:52:21 <Phearlock> Simmer faster!
23:52:43 <Camail> snacks are important
23:52:48 <DuB`> Yes
23:52:52 <DuB`> This is why I had a cookie ;D
23:52:53 <Camail> for example, i am eating an apple, great snack
23:53:03 <Camail> your snack is good too, for a different reason
23:53:22 <Phearlock> Both excellent snacks
23:53:33 <Camail> but never a cookie apple
23:53:36 <Camail> i dont think that works
23:53:41 <DuB`> Hmm
23:53:54 <DuB`> An apple-fritter-like cookie might be good.
23:53:55 <Camail> apple cookie maybe but thats 100% just gonna be a cinnamon cookie
23:53:55 <Phearlock> Could you make like, an apple-pie ish cookie?
23:54:02 <DuB`> ye ye
23:54:13 <Camail> at that point, eat a pie
23:54:16 <Camail> in fact, only pies
23:54:21 <Camail> throw out your rice, eat a pie
23:54:23 <DuB`> Pie is not a snack!
23:54:26 <DuB`> pah
23:54:34 <Phearlock> What if it's a really small pie?
23:54:36 <Camail> pie is whatever you need it to be
23:54:47 <Phearlock> You could eat a quarter of a pie
23:58:22 <DuB`> Haha
23:58:38 <DuB`> Crisium, surefour just won 5 in a row to sneak into top 500 5 min before season end
