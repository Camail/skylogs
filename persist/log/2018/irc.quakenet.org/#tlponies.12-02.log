08:48:11 <Yoltphone> Hello pones!
08:48:38 <Yoltphone> I NEED HALP
08:52:29 <Golly> oh dear
08:54:13 <Yoltphone> Let say, I may know an awesome girl. Apparently she had a date / boyfriend ongoing for some months. Let also say that I may have told her something like "I'm sorry, but not sorry, to be so into you" last week by text.. And to finish, let's say she has broken up with this guy today. Should I overthink it or not?
08:55:26 <Golly> do you have the mental fortitude not to overthink it?
08:56:03 <Yoltphone> Ahahaha, if I can not sleep tonight, the answer will be obvious
08:58:26 <Golly> i think the standard advice would be to show some patience
09:01:32 <Yoltphone> Sure, I was not planning to ask her out tomorrow (and I am not supposed to know she broke up), but I'll probably keep flirting / compliment her like I was doing before :')
09:03:31 <Golly> yeah just send her some cute pictures of dogs n stuff
09:04:44 <Yoltphone> She get 2/3 pictures of my cat every week
09:04:51 <Yoltphone> My cat is the cutest cat ever

19:35:57 <skram> again
19:36:36 <Dot`> i want to laugh skram but its very silly and scary
19:37:20 <skram> Turns out a 240mm^2 Al cable melted and then shorted out

19:43:53 <Camail> how many times has it been on fire?
19:45:09 <skram> too much current for some reason zounds, only once now cam
19:45:44 <Camail> well, at least it's not a pattern
19:45:56 <Camail> because tbh fire patterns have been out of fashion for years
19:46:16 <Camail> and nothing guy fieri can do will change that
19:46:24 <skram> wouldnt want to have unfashionable emergencies
