00:00:27 <Camail> if he's shooting air fireballs at you're ground level then he is sacrificing like a minimum of 1 second of doing nothing in the air
00:00:47 <Camail> if you aren't dashing forward you are wasting time
00:01:11 <Camail> from 100% full screen you can dash forward once and lasso
00:01:14 <Camail> and it hits
00:02:38 <Camail> lasso is free so it's always an option
00:04:23 <Camail> yea the lasso is really good vs oleander because its just outside her jC range and still relevant before you get into that fireball+teleport mix up range
00:05:07 <Camail> also you have suer jump
00:05:10 <Camail> super*

00:49:47 <Dot`> i just thought you where busy and didnt want to rush you
00:50:08 <Dot`> runbun was playing against Crisium when i got back form supper
00:50:18 <Crisium> dot you should have played with me and run
00:50:36 <Camail> I'm always doing something, but usually never committed
00:50:39 <Crisium> ill play tomorrow or wednesday
00:50:50 <Camail> Phearlock  fite me
00:51:07 <Phearlock> Yeah alright, I'll go a few rounds =D
00:51:19 <Camail> I'm in the kitchen lobby
00:51:23 <DuB`> So
00:51:32 <DuB`> XQC is doing a "room cleaning" stream, apparently
00:51:40 <DuB`> He found month-old chicken in his VR headset
00:51:41 <DuB`> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/167799466592698368/422919423909953536/zGnxk.png
00:51:41 <Crisium> 12k viwers?
00:52:01 <DuB`> His desk-cleaning process was to dump half a bottle of glass cleaner on and then do this(???) with TP
00:52:09 <Dot`> ...
00:52:14 <Crisium> and 12k watch
00:52:28 <Crisium> so weird that people fall into his cult of personality of all people
00:58:35 <Camail> Phearlock  you always block low on wake up
00:59:10 <Dot`> you said to always block
00:59:36 <Phearlock> No I don't
01:02:56 <Phearlock> Wait can I not roll after your combo is done?
01:02:57 <Camail> bit tooa gressive
01:03:26 <Crisium> MFW when i dont know any of this combat system
01:04:01 <Phearlock> Also my light stays out forever if it misses, annoying =P
01:04:06 <Crisium> are there roman cancels, alpha cancels, or knockback-the-enemy (whatever its called) while blocking?
01:04:19 <Crisium> alpha counters*
01:05:05 <Phearlock> It's like holding block doesn't work =P
01:05:15 <Camail> its a mix up
01:05:17 <Camail> after the super
01:05:22 <Camail> thats where you just gotta guess
01:05:35 <Phearlock> But it hit fucking overhad and I was stand blocking wtf xD
01:05:36 <Camail> their are cross counters cris
01:05:42 <Camail> it hit the other side hpear
01:05:49 <Camail> you just blocked the wrong wauy
01:05:57 <Camail> its not about down or up on that mix up
01:05:58 <Camail> its left or right
01:06:19 <Crisium> how do you cross counter
01:08:01 <Camail> i dont know
01:08:01 <Phearlock> Also inputting launcher when I really wanted down C didn't help there =P
01:11:47 <Camail> paprika has terrible neutral
01:11:51 <Camail> but is a monster on offense
01:11:56 <Camail> that's the character
01:11:58 <Phearlock> Please use your projectiles more =P
01:14:59 <Phearlock> I don't really know where the openings in paprikas pressure are for sneaking in light hits
01:17:34 <Camail> those arent things phear
01:17:38 <Camail> thats not a thing in this game
01:17:44 <Camail> you pushblock to return to neutral
01:17:49 <DuB`> YA
01:17:50 <DuB`> HOOO
01:17:51 <Phearlock> Oh yeah that
01:17:53 <Camail> anyone you play that gets hit by lgihts is doing something wrong
01:18:15 <DuB`> Summer internship with major firm in San Fran confirmed
01:18:21 <DuB`> Feels friggin good man
01:20:37 <Camail> see how pushblock engates all of your offense
01:20:40 <Camail> negates*
01:20:50 <Phearlock> Literally not practiced with that
01:20:54 <Phearlock> do you just spam two buttons?
01:21:40 <Dot`> dub <3
01:22:58 <Camail> yea its just two buttons
01:23:03 <Camail> gz dub
01:23:06 <Camail> now less stress
01:23:08 <Phearlock> And the need to be input?
01:23:09 <Camail> so less study
01:23:18 <DuB`> Haha
01:23:19 <Camail> just two buttons while in block stun
01:23:23 <Phearlock> No easy way to do it than trying to time it?
01:23:24 <DuB`> Less stress, same study :P
01:23:26 <DuB`> I'll take it.
01:24:37 <DuB`> Moving one timezone farther away from EUfriends though, whoops 
01:26:42 <Crisium> how do you pushblock?
01:26:58 <DuB`> I dun even know what that is
01:27:24 <Crisium> when blocking, push the other guy away from you
01:27:53 <DuB`> Sounds gud
01:34:46 <Camail> I've 100% tried to go cross up after super
01:34:53 <Camail> just hold forward
01:34:59 <Camail> when i cross up it turns into back
01:35:03 <Camail> and you block the cross up
01:35:22 <Phearlock> wat
01:35:39 <Camail> after super i am jumping over you
01:35:40 <Phearlock> The floof jumping across me move I assume
01:35:48 <Camail> so wihe you are on the ground you are holding back to block
01:35:54 <Camail> but when i cross up it changed to wakling forward
01:36:05 <Camail> this is a left-right mix up
01:36:14 <Camail> so you have to choose to hold left or right
01:36:25 <Camail> you cant react to the jump
01:36:41 <Camail> so you just gotta guess which side I'll hit you and commit to a direction beforehand
01:37:23 <Phearlock> Even the few times I've blocked the initial hit you just transition to some overhead or down before I can react xD
01:37:42 <Camail> i have only ever done the cross up into a normal string of moves
01:37:43 <Phearlock> Is it just a guessing game?
01:37:47 <Camail> only the first part
01:37:55 <Camail> but once you block it you can pushblock and its done
01:38:21 <Camail> you can freely block mid to account for the overhead i do at the end because I am so far away
01:38:28 <Camail> i could hit you with a low at that range no matter what
01:38:41 <Camail> couldnt*
01:39:07 <Camail> all of the things i did to you are solved with waiting for the block, then pushblocking
01:39:32 <Phearlock> "normal string of moves" doesn't mean much when I don't know what paprikas normal string is
01:39:32 <Camail> you pressed a lot of buttons while on defense, and i hit you out of most of them
01:39:55 <Camail> well you've seen me do it hundreds of times now >_>
01:40:15 <Camail> its universally A then B, for every character, i think
01:41:56 <Crisium> thats what i do lol, ABC
01:42:02 <Camail> the main thing is to learn to recognize when you are on defense and how to play defense
01:42:14 <Camail> well C is almost always unsafe so thats hit confirmed
01:42:21 <Crisium> yeah hit confirm only ofc
01:42:42 <Phearlock> I feel I should just always block down if you're that close unless I see you jump but I don't know if I can react =P
01:44:31 <Camail> reacting to hops is rough, ideally you learn the best defense with a combination of learning your opponents offensive patterns and knowing their options at various ranges
01:44:46 <Camail> but at your point you can develop more by not doing unsafe hittable stuff
01:45:00 <Camail> not punishable, but slow moves at the wrong time
01:45:44 <Camail> I threw twice the entire set, and i can explain both, and why exactly they worked

01:45:57 -!- mode/#tlponies [+v Phearlock] by Q
01:46:10 <Camail> the first was after a super, i knew you were trying to block but didnt know how, I stuffed any button attempt and got you scared of the mix up
01:46:27 <Camail> the second was at the beginning of the round when i noticed you always move back and play passive for the first 2 seconds
01:46:39 <Camail> its those kind of gleaned bits of info that inform decision making
01:47:05 <Camail> but during the rest of the time you always wanted to rpess buttons, do damage, do combo
01:48:04 <Camail> which that character kinda shoe horns you into when that's all you know
01:49:17 <Phearlock> Not sure what to look for in that case.
01:49:33 <Phearlock> Just move more aggressively but don't actually hit buttons
01:49:34 <Phearlock> ?
01:49:42 <Phearlock> (I know I push too many buttons lol)
01:49:53 <Camail> well for one, every time i super in the corner, i am forced into the corner, and being in the corner sucks
01:50:05 <Camail> so in that mix up you know i get something good when i cross you up
01:50:15 <Camail> so blocking the cross up more often than not is a good thing
01:50:47 <Camail> well your question is about neutral, which is a different topic but equally as important
01:51:17 <Camail> when you are at a disadvantage you are doing your best not to get hit, that's your goal
01:51:28 <Phearlock> That bit about wanting to get out of the corner and hence more likely to cross up is really obvious in hindsight
01:51:31 <Camail> if you want to know what to do when we are both at an equal fotting, moving around the stage, that's neutral
01:51:39 <Camail> footing*
01:52:11 <Camail> yea thats the mix up phear, either i cross up and do the most obvious option for th emix up, or i stay in the corner and do the riskier but less predictable option
01:52:22 <Camail> that mix up is a case of risk reward for both of us
01:52:27 <Phearlock> See I can't figure this out while playing haha xD
01:52:33 <Phearlock> Need to go ponder it after the fact
01:52:53 <Camail> fighting games are mostly prep
01:53:33 <Camail> but also knowing aobut the concept of a cross up would help
01:53:48 <Camail> i thought you saw me changing sides and would start, but i was kinda auto piloting
01:55:57 <Phearlock> Things were learned
01:56:44 <Camail> my air normals are so bad, it's annoying
01:56:52 <Camail> all my normals are pretty garbage
01:57:15 <Phearlock> Longer range than mine I think =P
01:57:29 <Camail> not the air normals
01:57:37 <Phearlock> yeah
01:58:26 <Phearlock> Your c air is really nice though. that is a very lingering hitbox xD
01:58:38 <Camail> yea but its really small
01:58:52 <Camail> and slow, is like 100% just for combos and mix ups
01:59:19 <Camail> she doesn't use normals to get in, she uses items, teleports, her 56A
01:59:30 <Camail> sometimes hopB
01:59:40 <Camail> which is her best air normal but its pretty hard to convert

02:53:29 <Camail> sorry, had to drive someone to a train
02:53:47 <Phearlock> No worries, still awake somehow
02:53:48 <Camail> yea fighting games are hard
02:54:03 <Camail> i am used to teaching people, its most of what i do with fighting games recently
02:56:47 <Camail> you should watch the salty suit twitch vod, gives you an idea of what real gameplay looks like
02:56:51 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/videos/237141834
02:57:05 <Camail> the first half is SG bu the second half is tfh
02:57:20 <DuB`> oooh
02:58:00 <Camail> a lot of neutral game is being at the right distance, not necessarily pressing a button
02:58:21 <Camail> of course, the reason you get to certain distances is to push a button, but good movement is a reward in itself
02:58:23 <Camail> dub no
02:58:25 <Camail> you cant watch
02:58:26 <Camail> no fun

03:03:31 <Phearlock> Mhmm, gotta head to bed, link saved

03:07:57 <Phearlock> But don't go out of your way to search
03:12:30 <Camail> i dont even know where to look, so yea
03:12:37 <Camail> the only scene i know of is that weekly
03:13:03 <Phearlock> Yeah I've searched around but no luck yet =D
03:13:30 <Camail> https://forums.themsfightinherds.com/index.php
03:13:35 <Camail> this is probably a good place to start
03:13:48 <Camail> SG uses their official forums a lot and this community pulls a lot from SG
03:13:55 <Camail> so they probably post stuff here
03:14:02 <Phearlock> Kinda fun too though, not having any solid references sorta enhances the "oh wow you can do that?" feeling
03:15:20 <Camail> true, the negatives are that you build up a ton of bad habits
03:15:39 <Camail> having a good foundation makes you a better player, but that might not be the entire goal
03:15:50 <Phearlock> Yus

21:45:10 <Crisium> ABC, launcher, ABC, special move :D
21:45:11 <Camail> Crisium  you should consider doing 236A xx 324C
21:45:21 <Camail> i dont think firepony can deal with the anti air trap well
21:45:47 <Crisium> 324C?  whats that
21:45:53 <Camail> qcb
21:45:58 <Camail> its the trap
21:45:59 <Crisium> i mean what move is it
21:46:02 <Crisium> oh
21:46:05 <Camail> like parasouls tears
21:46:10 <Crisium> i have not even tried with the traps at all
21:46:14 <Crisium> i use magic for instant fireball
21:46:19 <Camail> traps and teleports are what she spends magic on
21:46:26 <Camail> thats less useful
21:46:36 <Crisium> punishes whiffs, its so fast
21:46:55 <Camail> yea but like, why punish with 300 damage
21:47:00 <DuB`> https://twitter.com/hahaahahahahaha/status/973626079691853824
21:47:01 <Camail> you dont convert off it
21:47:14 <Crisium> i convert satisfaction with them being full screen
21:47:16 <Camail> save the magic for neutral that turns into offense, or as an escape
21:47:36 <Camail>  its a good way to gain projectile superiority, i think that's about it
21:48:08 <Camail> but teleports already fill in the anti zoning slot of the toolbelt
21:48:29 <Camail> which leads to 4 times the damage
21:49:11 <Crisium> i guess
21:49:15 <Crisium> still havent played much yet

22:10:07 <Zounds> I've had a lot of practice shooting guys
22:10:33 <Crisium> will challenge dub now
22:10:46 <Zounds> I still sometimes get sent to the dumpster by some BR1 who sprays at me though
22:11:52 <Zounds> It's the beauty of planetside I suppose

22:20:17 <Camail> Dot  graB IS bc
22:20:20 <Dot> ok, i really have no idea what breaks that
22:21:40 <DuB`> I think losing to oleander 5 times is less fun than losing to Camail Ryu 20 times
22:21:46 <Crisium> oh no
22:21:59 <Camail> because ryu isnt a zoner
22:22:06 <Camail> and you guys dont know how to beat zoners
22:22:16 <Dot> so cam, how to beat crouching llama
22:22:20 <Camail> grab
22:22:23 <Dot> i dont know what breaks it
22:22:26 <Dot> OHHH
22:22:36 <Camail> grab me, yo
22:22:36 <Dot> haha im so bad
22:22:54 <Camail> new, mostly
22:23:17 <Camail> DuB`  you have better projectiles
22:23:29 <Camail> specifically the ones that hover in the air
22:23:35 <Camail> you revel in being farther away
22:23:39 <Camail> you have a full screen low
22:23:52 <Camail> if oleander is staying away from you she's doing your job for you
22:26:18 <Dot> who am i fighting next?
22:28:36 <Crisium> back to lobby?
22:28:59 <Crisium> lets do dub vs dot next
22:33:04 <Dot> IM SO BAD
22:33:23 <Phearlock> story of my life
22:35:57 <Camail> right now your mind is full of fuck
22:36:01 <Camail> gotta wear down the fuck
22:36:12 <Camail> drain the fuck through simplifying all these new concepts and experiences
22:36:19 <Camail> this fuck swamp has a bottom
22:37:46 <Dot> also the guy before dub destroyed me, i never got a shot in
22:37:58 <DuB`> Ye had some good teleport combos that round
22:38:03 <DuB`> Those are what cris ate me alive wiht
22:38:17 <Dot> i cant fireball to save my liife
22:38:29 <DuB`> lotsa lotsa those
22:38:33 <Dot> i just cant combo it even in combo training
22:38:45 <Dot> timing are all off apparently
22:40:04 <Camail> Dot  change your frame delay in training room
22:40:14 <Camail> but i dont think thats your problem
22:40:18 <Dot> DAMIMT DUB
22:40:19 <Dot> JUST ONE
22:40:28 <Camail> its a very very common problem to have moving from trianing to real matches
22:40:32 <Camail> your fingers are moving too fast
22:40:44 <Camail> you think the timings are shorter than they are because you are thinking really fast during a match
22:40:53 <Camail> the rhythm you have in training room is calm and focused
22:41:01 <Camail> matches are fast, hectic, and stressful
22:41:31 <Camail> so you fail at combos you normal do all the time because you need to learn how to do them while also playing the game
22:42:05 <Dot> im sayig i cant even get fireball times right in training
22:42:16 <Dot> so in matches its hopeless, i just stand there
22:43:13 <Phearlock> nice to have somewhere to start
22:43:15 <Zounds> gnight ponies
22:43:19 <Phearlock> 1. consistent fireballs
22:43:36 <Camail> Dot  try rolling your fingers
22:43:41 <Zounds> train hard dotties
22:43:44 <Zounds> make a montage
22:43:52 <Camail> you need to get all 3 direction, i find rolling your hand is the best for me
22:43:59 <Dot> wow dub...
22:44:04 <Dot> gae was frizen with lag
22:44:07 <Dot> and you kill me
22:44:44 <Camail> dub reset so i can watch you fight

22:52:45 <Rawr|Fone> And if you keep playing, one day you will be on the other side dotties
22:53:26 <Dot> yea rawr, im fine, its just i spent an hour getitng destroyed, i know its whats going to happen for at least a few weeks

23:17:33 <Camail> fair
23:17:47 <Camail> you had better defense than anyone else so far
23:18:16 <Camail> i got a lot of chances to learn your defense
23:18:40 <Camail> also the mix up after the super was a cross up
23:20:00 <Runbunny> one more Dot  https://i.imgur.com/GBNW1zS.mp4

23:31:32 <Crisium> ggs phear
23:31:33 <Phearlock> Yeah that's enough fireballs for tonight
23:31:48 <Phearlock> I'm just way too impatient
23:32:06 <Phearlock> But the fucking teleport mixups are like
23:32:08 <Phearlock> how
23:32:32 <Camail> the only way you get mixed up is if you wait for a fireball to go fulls screen
23:32:51 <Phearlock> Well sometimes I am on the other side of the screen
23:32:56 <Camail> you have to be in a certain range of posisitions for it to even work, so avoid those
23:32:58 <Phearlock> and there is a slow fireball and a fast one
23:33:05 <Phearlock> It has a range????
23:33:05 <Camail> super jump awaaaay
23:33:22 <Camail> or jump into the fireball and block it on purpose
23:33:26 <Camail> thats also an option
23:34:17 <Phearlock> It has a range???
23:34:21 <Camail> the teleport?
23:34:23 <Phearlock> yes
23:34:30 <Camail> no, the set up does
23:34:36 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
23:34:44 <Camail> its a bit hard to put into words but
23:35:00 <Camail> the fireball is moving towards you and she will only teleport when its right next to you
23:35:20 <Camail> so if you move forward then the fireball will hit you too quickly to teleport
23:35:38 <Camail> or you block it before he can do the teleport
23:35:41 <Phearlock> If she teleports anyway are you supposed to react to it?
23:35:46 <Phearlock> Because that seems impossible
23:36:19 <Camail> reacting to the teleport is possible, its relatively slow, but thats not the only option
23:36:21 <Phearlock> Like even if the fireball doesn't hit at the same time I'm still gong to be landing or standing and be blocking the wrong way
23:36:37 <Camail> for example, neutral jump the fireball and hitting a normal while falling down
23:36:54 <Phearlock> Preeeeetty sure the unicorn will jsut hit me out of that
23:36:55 <Camail> if she teleports, the fireball whiffs and you punish the teleport
23:37:18 <Camail> if she doesnt teleport, she cant really do anything about your whiffed normal
23:37:21 * skram slaps DuB` around a bit with a large trout
23:37:25 <DuB`> Sunday monday tuesday I have nothing to watch, no OWL or CR on D:
23:37:27 <DuB`> skram wat
23:37:41 <Dot> skram, did you talk to bio yet
23:37:47 <skram> what doing
23:37:54 <skram> no?
23:38:00 <DuB`> Am am doing trying to decide what to be doing
23:38:21 <Dot> play dnd dub
23:38:40 <skram> look at this weird cat DuB` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J1ynsuWcNQ
23:38:46 <Camail> I've given you options to deal with the setup, whether you want to learn them is up to you
23:38:59 <Phearlock> I think I get it.
23:39:22 <Phearlock> Just gotta play the matchup more but it's an annoying matchup =D
23:39:25 <DuB`> It's a pretty weird cat, skram.
23:39:44 <skram> I know!
23:40:00 <Dot> skram, you wantd to know form bio if he was doing the thing
23:40:22 <DuB`> Also I can't just DnD at will, Dot.
23:40:28 <DuB`> I dun think that's how it works.
23:40:31 <skram> ya but i think he is busy
23:40:33 <Dot> well not with that attitude
23:41:23 <skram> he's a chef now so he's probablly bending bananas or setting fire to tasty, tasty animalls or something
23:41:36 <DuB`> Setting fire to bananas?

23:42:13 <Camail> if oleander is using teleports she isn't using traps, which means her zoning suffers. so put offensive pressure on her and slowly walk her to the corner, bait the teleport and punish
23:42:39 <Camail> that's the general strat against zoners with teleports, first you gotta eliminate that option to freely switch sides and regain screen space
23:43:00 <skram> Maybe thats a thing you need to do sometimes DuB`
23:43:42 <DuB`> Does sound interesting.
23:46:41 <Phearlock> It sounds so simple!
23:46:56 <Phearlock> But I guess in theory it is. just got to not be retareded
23:47:49 <skram> Here's a thing for you, DuB`: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn-O69T7sPQ

23:48:32 <skram> I really want a synthesizer
23:48:50 <Camail> its seems simple because its a direction to guide your play, not the specific things to do in order to accomplish it
23:49:01 <skram> I dont know how to play keys but I NEEED a thing that goes boop beep
23:49:05 <Phearlock> yes
23:49:11 <DuB`> Bleep bleep blop
23:51:21 <DuB`> Well
