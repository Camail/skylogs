00:52:58 <Crisium> you can in air fire balls :O
00:53:00 <Crisium> ;p;
00:53:16 <Phearlock> The alternating thing is annyoing =D
00:56:31 <Crisium> zoning is my only hope lol
00:56:32 <Bio> ASDF
00:56:34 <Bio> hi
00:56:36 <Phearlock> This is good practice
01:01:01 <Phearlock> Trying to get the block timing just right =P
01:02:12 <Crisium> ok we're 4-4, last 1 :P
01:02:25 <Phearlock> Never had an excuse to learn the super jump until now
01:06:12 <Crisium> you are too strongk
01:06:13 <Crisium> ggs
01:06:32 <Phearlock> ggs, I haven't really had to deal with oleander before
01:06:38 <Camail> cris your anti air is really good
01:06:43 <Phearlock> those fireballs are scary when alternated like that
01:06:53 <Camail> also you can cancel the fireballs into the traps
01:07:00 <Crisium> there ends my first 89 mins of the game according to steam :P
01:07:07 <Camail> qcb for the traps
01:07:15 <Crisium> yeah i never even used that lol
01:07:47 <Camail> 214C is really good for making sure fuck boys dont jump in on your fireball
01:07:57 <Phearlock> I need to be a bit more patient getting in
01:07:58 <Crisium> ill have to dedicate some time to this game someday, is fun
01:08:13 <Camail> a bit?
01:08:25 <Phearlock> Yeah not much more
01:08:28 <Phearlock> Just a bit
01:08:32 <Camail> eyup
01:09:23 <Phearlock> Accept that the two fireballs are going to stop you for a bit and just block it and then plenty of time to jump to get ready for the next one
01:22:35 <DuB`> XQC Actually Fired
01:23:09 <DuB`> Turns out being suspended from playing more often than not makes things hard for your team!
01:24:20 <Camail> ah, the s1mple of overwatch
01:27:32 <Camail> no, more like the kng
01:27:55 <Camail> moral of the story: dont use 3 letters for your name
01:28:04 <DuB`> Haha
01:28:24 <Micen> careful DUB
01:28:29 <DuB`> Funny thing is the SC2 QXC keeps getting mentioned by accident etc
01:30:57 <DuB`> Left or right hand for directions on keyboard TFH?
01:33:29 <Camail> left hand
01:33:41 <Camail> use asd[space]

01:39:14 <Phearlock> Some nice guy online completely bodied me and then told me some tidbits on my char. what a nice guy
01:39:53 <Phearlock> I can cancel 2c with flight to not get punished so hard. Amaze
01:40:22 <Phearlock> Getting pretty late though, will practice tomorrow

01:52:52 <DuB`> hoof fite kick kick
01:53:22 <Phearlock> It's a great fighting game as it's hard to be salty at the adorable characters for bodying you so hard
01:53:29 <DuB`> Haha
01:53:59 <Phearlock> Though I'm still in the blissful discovery phase of "oh wow you can do what?"
02:35:43 <Camail> i dont think i will ever like an anime fighter more than an sf game mostly because i prefer having a fast walk speed instead of a run

08:15:48 <Dot> hows your evening?
08:17:04 <Cane> Full of Ash vs Evil Dead so far.
08:20:34 <Dot> ive heard that show is is great in a non serious over the top way
08:31:52 <Dot> .tell dub` https://imgur.com/gallery/EdmAg
08:52:04 <Cane> It's pretty much Evil Dead 2 in show form, only with Army of Darkness Ash. It's also gorier than the movies in that completely over the top kind of way that makes it funny.
08:52:22 <Cane> It's that typical Sam Raimi line of horror and comedy.

09:52:13 <Dot> im a bit sick, got work soon
09:52:15 <Dot> you?
09:52:38 <skram> Im just being lazy as h eck
09:53:13 <Dot> nice
09:53:47 <skram> Why you sick though Dot
09:53:51 <skram> its not a good time
09:56:07 <Dot> nope
09:59:30 <Dot> what you going to do today skram?
10:00:05 <Dot> and i dont feel liek you increase your hit points at lvl 4
10:01:12 <skram> I did, clerics get 1d8
10:01:22 <skram> wait
10:02:34 <Dot> did you roll instead of taking average?
10:02:54 <skram> 1st level 10 2nd 17 3rd 24
10:03:01 <skram> no
10:03:15 <skram> i rolled on level 4 though and got a 6 afaik
10:03:43 <skram> avg is 5, i have +1 CON and racial ability that gives me 1 hp per level
10:04:14 <Dot> yea, you didnt increase your hp
10:04:54 <skram> it should be 32
10:05:06 <Dot> thats makes more sense, you had less health than bio
10:07:53 <skram> Why do I have 21 AC on my sheet though mr Dot
10:07:58 <skram> Did you fiddle with it
10:14:48 <Dot> nope
10:15:01 <Dot> must have been Bio setting it to that so he would remember
10:15:16 <skram> hmm i didnt see where
10:15:36 <Dot> didnt see where wat?
10:15:49 <skram> like theres no reason i can see that i do
10:16:00 <skram> no global settings changed, armor is right value etc
10:16:02 <Dot> forg cleric
10:16:13 <Dot> he probably manualy changed it
10:16:17 <skram> no i know i do with the blessing of the forge
10:17:12 <skram> is there a way to cast spells on yourself
10:17:21 <skram> and have it show like a status effect
10:17:41 <Dot> nope
10:17:50 <skram> ill ask the bio i guess
10:17:52 <Dot> he probably just changed your ac
10:17:55 <skram> what he done did
10:18:02 <Dot> clicked on it and typed 21
10:18:11 <skram> you cant do that???
10:18:21 <Dot> done
10:18:25 <Dot> i set it to 20
10:18:42 <skram> huh
10:18:50 <skram> i am almost certain i wasnt able to do that before
10:19:06 <Dot> you lazy roll20 players thinking everything must be auto calculated
10:19:10 <Dot> haha
10:19:37 <skram> well it IS a calculated value and my shield+armor have AC values

21:12:30 <Dot`> damn this velvet AI
21:12:38 <Dot`> frikken ice crystal from the sky every second
21:14:14 <DuB`skul> Ah, the big overhead one
21:14:29 <Dot`> yea
21:14:34 <DuB`skul> Hehehe
21:14:39 <Dot`> and take 1 step back and ground ice crystals
21:15:06 <DuB`skul> AI taught me to use those waayy more than I was haha
21:15:24 <Crisium> dot playing now?
21:16:57 <Dot`> this is stupid
21:17:27 <Dot`> everyitme i try block its a backstep and the AI just does that ice tihng behind me
21:17:42 <Camail> its almost like the ai reacts to your inputs and has no strategy
21:17:57 <skram> Dot` my boy
21:18:10 <Camail> play a real human that has real tendencies and makes real mistakes
21:19:33 <Camail> velvet especially
21:19:48 <Camail> the ai sees two things, it sees you blocking low and sees you at the right distance,m so it does the overhead
21:20:22 <DuB`skul> Off to meetings, byebye

21:57:50 <Dot`> all
22:01:27 <Bio> I suppose i should start thinking about getting the dragon queen modules
22:01:36 <Bio> and learning how to use R20
22:01:38 <Bio> lel
22:07:02 <Camail> yea honestly everything else seems to pull almost no viewership, but CR provides subscribers and viewer numbers that probably support literally everything else
22:07:27 <Camail> alpha probably makes some amount of money, but it feels like a money sink at the moment

22:21:57 <Runbunny> Did you find the charge character Crisium?
22:22:08 <Crisium> yeah, but i like oleander better
22:22:16 <Crisium> because i am a coward and want to throw fireballs and run away
22:22:18 <Crisium> :D

22:38:22 <Crisium> but i can get it punch from behind lol
22:38:26 <Runbunny> me neither.
22:44:16 <Camail> are you playing oleander cris? if so i think its basically a jojo's stand/puppet
22:44:29 <Crisium> ye
22:44:47 <Camail> yea it's basically an assist
22:45:16 <Crisium> man her fireball does good damage
22:45:24 <Runbunny> I am not blocking.
22:45:26 <Camail> ^
22:45:33 <Camail> it's only ok
22:45:42 <Runbunny> I keep trying to block them with blitz shield. but that is not a thing in this game.
22:46:11 <Camail> its strength comes from setting up sim style teleport mix ups and controlling space, not damage
22:46:17 <Camail> that's more of a velvet thing
22:46:33 <Camail> 90% of damage in this game is gonna come from optimal combos
22:46:46 <Camail> of which is still haven't learned
23:02:52 <Crisium> gotta use that magic fireball more
23:02:56 <Crisium> its so fast
23:06:10 <Crisium> last 1 for now
23:08:27 <Crisium> ggs
23:08:52 <Crisium> uh oh

23:27:57 <Crisium> yeah, if you throw the air fireball low enough it hits on ground which is crazy

23:47:17 <skram> yeah he's a riot actually
23:48:43 <Camail> Runbunny  if you think oleander is bad, you do not want to fight a good velvet
23:48:54 <Camail> that's the dedicated zoner/lockdown of this game
23:49:26 <Dot`> no fun allowed
23:49:28 <Camail> a lot of oleander's zoning isn't real
23:49:30 <DuB`> Velveeeeeet
23:49:41 <Camail> speaking of no fun
23:49:46 <Phearlock> I feel ike it's easier to get in on velvet but I've played like 5000% more matches against velvet than oleander
23:49:46 <Camail> dub leave, you gotta do school stuff

23:50:14 <Phearlock> Not used to anticipating the teleport
23:50:16 <Runbunny> It just feels like Cow doesn't have a way to deal with some of it even. 
23:50:21 <Camail> nah, velvet has way more projectile options
23:50:37 <Camail> and longer reaching normals
23:50:55 <Camail> her super puts you farther away, her meter burn gives her even more zoning
23:50:56 <Runbunny> well you have the dash thingy, but you need magic for that.
23:51:08 <Camail> a GOOD velvet is better at keeping you out
23:54:06 <Runbunny> No fun.
23:54:30 <Camail> alright, time to lab and tell you how
23:54:46 <Camail> apart from literally raw supering through it all
23:55:18 <Camail> my general idea behind everything you learn in the first month of a fighting game: you are wrong, there is something you can do
23:55:34 <Camail> accept that you dont know what to do, and figure out what you are missing
23:55:52 <Phearlock> Yeah I find that's correct about 99.5% of the time
23:56:00 <Camail> three's a difference in attitude between being hopelessly locked out and being perplexed
23:58:06 <Crisium> run and i both only have 3 hours so we're just winging it
