00:06:49 <skram> bleep bloop
01:02:19 <skram> DuB`
01:07:34 <DuB`> skram
01:08:37 <skram> are you ok
01:11:35 <DuB`> Quite
01:13:26 <skram> did you fix waidwens legacy yet
01:13:42 <Camail> hollowborn are people too
01:13:46 <Camail> dont be racist
01:14:17 <Phearlock> Well, they were people.
01:14:18 <skram> you're not a person if you dont have a soul
01:14:30 <DuB`> I did
01:14:39 <DuB`> But then I realized I have to go do DLC stuff BEFORE that
01:14:49 <DuB`> So I undid my fixing of waidwens legacy :P
01:14:55 <Phearlock> Ah
01:14:56 <Camail> no thats good
01:14:59 <skram> o ya
01:15:02 <Camail> that's the best way to do it, beat the game before the dlc
01:15:16 <Camail> because the dlc is kinda spoilery
01:15:32 <DuB`> You... can't?
01:15:43 <Phearlock> He means beat the game
01:15:47 <Camail> ya
01:15:50 <Phearlock> then go back and do the dlc
01:15:52 <Phearlock> then beat the game
01:16:01 <Phearlock> like you're doing
01:16:06 <DuB`> Ye
01:16:06 <Camail> also the hollowborn were never people
01:16:13 <Camail> they never had souls enter their bodies
01:16:14 <DuB`> Once you go down into place you're locked in
01:16:26 <Camail> DuB`  yea but reloading saves is a thing
01:16:36 <DuB`> Yes I had to
01:16:39 <Camail> yup yup
01:16:45 <Camail> and i say that's th best way to do it
01:17:07 <DuB`> Thought "Oke I will kill guy then go do all those things"
01:17:11 <Camail> because getting the engwithan revelation before you do the DLC adds important context
01:17:17 <DuB`> But then it was "Oke you killed guy GG goodbye forever never come back"
01:17:53 <Camail> the final dungeon isn't even that long if you skip through all the dialog
01:18:04 <skram> You live happily ever after DuB`
01:18:12 <skram> your frens go on and do good things maybe
01:18:33 <Phearlock> Yeah you go buy a boat and have a nice relaxing cruise
01:18:46 <DuB`> Hehe
01:18:47 <Phearlock> NOTHING BAD HAPPENS
01:19:14 <skram> correct
01:19:15 <Camail> nothing bad has ever happened in the eastern reach
01:19:41 <Camail> also dont look at any promo material for poe2 because it's ALL spoilers
01:19:55 <DuB`> Oh hey senate overturned FCC net neutrality dereg
01:19:57 <DuB`> Noice
01:20:00 <Camail> once you get through the first 30 minutes it's safe tho
01:20:04 <Camail> senate voted for it
01:20:10 <Camail> now we need the house, and trump not to veto
01:20:13 <skram> Is it just me being bad or is boat combat really hard
01:20:13 <Camail> aka it's still hopeless
01:20:33 <Camail> skram ok there's really just a few options
01:20:35 <Phearlock> Boat combat was slightly tricky when you do not have money. Then piss easy once you have money.
01:20:41 <Camail> buy the cannons with 600m range and use those
01:21:07 <Camail> also boat movement changes cannon accuracy
01:21:12 <Camail> jibbing is -30
01:21:18 <Camail> holding position is +20
01:21:26 <skram> i see
01:21:27 <Camail> hover over the hit % to see the modifiers
01:21:40 <skram> i tried boarding because my cannons didnt do anything
01:21:47 <Camail> you can see you opponents cannons if you go in the "report to stations" option
01:21:49 <skram> there was like 20 dudes on that boat
01:21:53 <Phearlock> Boarding can be really nasty early on.
01:21:54 <Camail> cannons have a range
01:22:03 <Camail> starting cannons are 200m-500m i think
01:22:15 <skram> yes
01:22:16 <Camail> and on the hardest difficulty boarding is murder
01:22:24 <Phearlock> Or just click the boat in the facing thing down in the bottom middle. gives you the same screen camail
01:22:43 <Camail> ah
01:22:55 <Camail> but yea, hold position before you fire
01:23:11 <Phearlock> The boarding music is sweet though.
01:23:34 <skram> the few ships i've met had more cannons than me and just outlasted me
01:23:36 <Phearlock> But yeah, much easier to just shoot
01:23:45 <skram> unless theres a way to pimp your boat with more cannon placements?
01:23:52 <Phearlock> Buy a bigger boat
01:23:57 <DuB`> Double barrel cannons
01:24:00 <DuB`> GATLING CANNONS
01:24:06 <Camail> or fire, then jib, then fire
01:24:16 <Camail> get into a good range and your dps is pretty strong
01:24:28 <Camail> get the cannons that do 6-9
01:24:31 <Phearlock> Yeah, the base boat is fast enough on the jib that it can do pretty good dps.
01:24:35 <Camail> ironcald thunderer, i think
01:24:37 <Camail> clad*
01:25:05 <Phearlock> both the imperial longgun and thunderer do 6-9. 300-600 and 200-500 range respectively
01:25:14 <Phearlock> 2 turns longer reload on the long gun
01:25:18 <Camail> the thunerers have a 4 round cooldown, enough time to fire, jib,hold,fire, jib
01:25:24 <DuB`> https://twitter.com/AskJayne/status/996924162798047232
01:26:05 <Camail> that seems terrible
01:26:09 <Camail> i need some friction
01:26:15 <DuB`> Haha
01:26:17 <Phearlock> The thing I kind suspected did happen btw Camail. You really go from having not enough money to afford a new boat to having money to buy the best boat in no time at all.
01:26:29 <Phearlock> So there's not that much point in buying anything in the middle
01:26:36 <Camail> yea, then you spend money on upgrading to legendary
01:26:41 <Phearlock> Yes xD
01:27:16 <Phearlock> I'm so close to done now. Just exploring the world map
01:27:17 <Camail> i only had 180k by the time I was done, and i didnt even upgrade everything
01:27:26 <Phearlock> then gonna head off into the endgame
01:27:45 <Camail> i didnt explore the southeast first time trough
01:27:55 <Camail> ALSO the entire ocean is quiet
01:27:58 <Camail> i killed every boat
01:28:05 <Camail> other than one merchant who i literally cant attack
01:28:08 <Phearlock> I do wish some more boats respawned.
01:28:13 <Camail> yea
01:29:25 <Phearlock> I'd say my final verdict on battlemage is that it's pretty not-broken.
01:29:39 <Phearlock> It's good but it does rely on buffing itself a bunch at the start of combat
01:29:55 <Phearlock> Does great in longer fights, kinda meh in shorter ones.
01:29:58 <Camail> yea i noticed i needed to use mirror image and the other one
01:30:15 <Phearlock> Yeah spirit shield+ mirror image are mandatory casts at the start of combat.
01:30:37 <Camail> i generally prefer classes that build resources through fighting
01:30:40 <Camail> at least as main dps
01:30:41 <Phearlock> then later on maybe the spell reflect one if there's scary magic.
01:31:00 <Camail> my solution to casts is to run up to them and put my sword inside them until they stop casting
01:31:10 <Phearlock> Atm I just sorta buff-buff-charge-missile burst for 180 damage to everything that surrounds me.
01:31:31 <Phearlock> It works v0v
01:31:52 <Camail> cipher + melee dps is nice cuz if i cant hit you i can charm you
01:32:08 <Camail> things rarely have high deflection and high will
01:33:18 <DuB`> I just like shooting fireballs, man.
01:33:36 <Phearlock> I only found 1 soulbound weapon so far in poe2 though. Dunno if I just looked in the wrong places.
01:33:47 <Camail> there's a hood that gives -25% recovery speed to daggers/rapiers/stilettos and a pistol that gives -50% recover to melee strikes
01:33:53 <Camail> serafan attacks REAL fast
01:34:01 <Camail> like 2 times a second
01:34:12 <Phearlock> goodness
01:34:16 <Camail> ummm, i found 3 soulbound
01:34:24 <Camail> , actually 4
01:34:28 <Camail> but i couldn't get the 4th
01:34:35 <Phearlock> Ok good, I just looked in the wrong places =P
01:34:45 <Camail> still not as many as in poe1 dlc
01:34:56 <Camail> which has my favorite dagger EVER in any game
01:35:57 <Phearlock> Yeah I found that back in poe1, is gud.
01:36:26 <Camail> you can farm xp by going into storms
01:36:35 <Camail> which is the only way at certain points
01:37:52 <Phearlock> Anyway gonna go bed now. Probably finish the game tomorrow
01:38:16 <Camail> whats the wepon type of your soulbound
01:38:21 <Phearlock> mace
01:38:29 <Camail> oh yea you missed a good one
01:38:44 <Camail> i couldnt pick up the mace
01:39:11 <Phearlock> I'm not struggling so. I'll just go find them on the next playthrough
01:45:31 <DuB`> Ooh, another Dallas v Shanghai
01:45:34 <DuB`> IS TODEY THE DEY?

03:09:10 <DuB`> I believe in GEGURI FROGCHAMP
03:10:51 <Cane>  .tell Dot` STILL EXCITED WOO
03:10:57 <Cane> Uh.
03:11:00 <DuB`> Cane, nothing has changed! :P
03:11:10 <Cane> SHUT UP DUB THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS 24 HOURS AGO
03:11:24 <DuB`> Nothing has changed SINCE the announcement! :P
03:11:46 <DuB`> Or are we goint to get daily updates on whether you're still excited for it? Hehehe
03:12:09 <Crisium> Geguri Zarya
03:12:14 <DuB`> O BOI
03:19:56 <DuB`> I just want to WATCH cane play stalker 2!
03:19:59 <DuB`> Sounds nice.
03:23:57 <Camail> Cane  you put a space before the .tell
03:25:00 <Camail> also, is any of the old team working on it
03:25:05 <Camail> because i tohught that company imploded
03:26:40 <Camail> this game NEEDS to have strelok as the main character 
03:27:47 <DuB`> SHD???????
03:27:49 <DuB`> !!!!!!
03:29:31 <DuB`> Diya > taimou and geguri > mickie 
03:30:28 <Camail> people seem to be shitting on westworld season 2
03:40:15 <Camail> oh god, I'm watching a xenoblade chornicles 2 playthrough and this game is...why do people like this game
04:00:50 <Bio> asdf
04:19:16 <DuB`> SHD refuse to acknowledge that brig exists
04:28:18 <Bio> its like the team that is 0-30 is really slow to adapt or something
04:28:23 <Bio> Kappa no Kappa
04:29:53 <DuB`> Welp
04:30:12 <DuB`> Unless their dorado offense is SPICY they are actually going to go 0-40 in season 1 of OWL
04:30:18 <DuB`> This is probably their chance.
04:31:47 <Camail> how are they managing to not win a single time
04:32:15 <DuB`> Half the team speaks mandarin while the other half speak korean
04:32:21 <DuB`> Worst feedy supports in the league
04:32:37 <DuB`> Feedy maintank
04:32:46 <DuB`> No coordination (see language problem)
04:33:08 <Camail> they straight up dont share a common language?
04:33:14 <Camail> damn, that's some bold recruiting
04:33:28 <Camail> at least euros can speak english
04:33:33 <Camail> albeit some are terrible
04:34:23 <DuB`> Lots of koreans on NA/EU majority teams now, but at least they studied english in school or whatever
04:34:32 <DuB`> Korean+Mandarin is rough lol
04:35:00 <Camail> i guess you would be hard pressed to make a league that was deep enough that every team would be competitive
04:35:08 <Camail> 0-40 is fuckin rough tho
04:35:37 <DuB`> They've gone to game 5s before but that's about the extent of their success.
04:42:52 <DuB`> Nope GG
04:43:01 <Bio> 0-31
04:43:11 <Bio> such is dargons
04:46:41 <DuB`> So many Contenders teams that would be great in place of SHD... :T
04:46:45 <Camail> the last 3 games will put a lot of pressure on their opponents
04:47:10 <Camail> welcome to rigid season structures dubbles
04:57:27 <Camail> fuck, I'm doing another ending in poe2 and i forgot to equip stuff so I'm naked
04:57:35 <Camail> i was switching stuff out and forgot to finish
