21:20:24 <Runbunny> Hai Dot.
21:20:55 <Dot`> how was your day?
21:22:46 <Runbunny> Exhausting.
21:22:54 <Runbunny> Plus it was hot all day
21:26:57 <Camail> nap
21:27:00 <Camail> forever
21:27:04 <Camail> the eternal nap
21:32:33 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/rapha
21:32:52 <Runbunny> Sounds good.
21:33:05 <Bio> i believe thats called death
21:33:08 <Camail> it's kinda annoying that they ruined the 1v1 format
21:33:23 <Camail> but 2v2 is basically just quake so thats fun
21:51:57 <Cane> Rapha and Dahang work really well together. Good comms.
21:54:26 <Cane> Sigh, I should get QC working at some point.
21:54:43 <Cane> I love me my shock rifle but UT is dedder than ded meme gaem SC2
21:59:07 <Cane> Camail, thanks for letting me know he was streaming, I wasn't looking at my email.
21:59:20 <Cane> I needed a break from writing and programming all day.

21:59:51 <Cane> How's QC been for you?
22:01:39 <skram> Cane old lbean, have you been listening to that good good 90s dance music again
22:01:54 <Cane> I got into a bit of groove today skram, yeah.
22:02:06 <Camail> i like how they both retired from OW as soon as they started playing quake again
22:02:18 <Cane> Oh they definitely did Camail.
22:02:32 <Cane> They started playing it and just didn't stop.
22:02:36 <Cane> Which I'm fine with.
22:02:43 <Camail> for me it's been fine, i havent played as much lately cuz tlp has gotten amnesia and forgot about it
22:03:05 <Camail> played a bit yesterday but by the time i'm warmed up i have to stop cuz hands
22:03:14 <Cane> That sucks.
22:03:17 <Cane> Continuous problem?
22:03:46 <Camail> yea, unless i stop doing stuff and take rehab seriously it's just gonna be there forever
22:04:15 <Cane> Man, that really blows, I'm sorry.
22:04:19 <Camail> but it's good enough to just deal with
22:04:36 <Cane> You ever gonna do proper rehab?
22:08:16 <Camail> who can say, i don't have any plans for it. I should probably be doing rsi stretches tho
22:08:31 <Camail> i normally dont play anything that aggravates it
22:13:40 <Cane> Yeah, if anything could set it off it'd be Quake.
