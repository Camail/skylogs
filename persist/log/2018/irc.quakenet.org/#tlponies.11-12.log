01:09:14 <DuB`> Because no prof wants to split a unit over a long break and have everyone forget everything
01:09:36 <Bio> what a lucki boi
01:11:05 <Bio> you can watch some >comfy< spaceships

02:58:50 <Camail> PROBABLY SOME PPL WHOA RENT HERE ANYMORE
02:58:52 <Camail> caps
02:58:54 <Camail> totally intentional
02:59:01 <Camail> i am very emotional about eve
02:59:10 <Camail> and their...ships
03:00:08 <DuB`> hahaha
03:00:11 <skram> nein i never got into eeve
03:00:16 <DuB`> hmmkay
03:00:30 <skram> been thinking about trying it for like 9 years now though
03:00:40 <DuB`> Well bio has like 10 viewers playing it right now and I'm the only tlp viewer lol
03:00:44 <DuB`> BASCIALLY famous
03:01:15 <skram> crikey
03:02:00 <DuB`> Went back and found my old account from 2012 that I was using with the TLnet crew that has a bunch of $$, might buy a month and fly around
03:09:13 <DuB`> So if you do want to try after 9 years of wondering, I or Bio can toss you a referral link thing
03:15:37 <Camail> you should do it skram
03:15:46 <Camail> or watch some eve streams first
03:16:37 <Camail> maybe seeing how all these interaction actually work will inform your decision
03:19:33 <DuB`> The tutorials are quite good now
03:19:42 <DuB`> They're practically "the campaign mode" at this point
04:52:03 <Bio> nice
