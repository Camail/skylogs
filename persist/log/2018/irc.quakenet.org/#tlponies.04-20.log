15:38:11 <Zounds> Though I always found it kinda weird that if you throw a flashbang into genj he somehow resets the fuse on it so it can travel back to reach you

20:03:43 <DoT|Phone> bio hacked the whole net yet?
20:05:36 <Camail> I just tried this game called "for the king" it seems interesting
20:05:58 <Camail> it's kinda clunky and hard to approach, but seems interesting?
20:06:19 <Camail> there's like 0 story so its not for me, but it has fun mechanics and a cool aesthetic
20:28:49 <Zounds> looks neat

21:34:35 <Zounds> playing OW on EU atm if you're interested
21:34:37 <Zounds> 5 stak
21:34:38 <Zounds> so far
21:34:51 <Zounds> muh Runbunny 
21:35:03 <Runbunny> I'm gonna do some wow stuff then go sleep I think. Sorry, I am completely bombed.

21:35:56 <Zounds> No problemo duderino
21:36:04 <Zounds> I've been WoWing a tiny bit to try out the leveling changes
21:36:08 <Zounds> I like them so far
21:36:16 <Runbunny> I haven't tried that yet. 
21:36:17 <Zounds> actually completed a zone for once
21:37:24 <Zounds> plus my dots are worth casting
21:54:03 <Micen> Wish we could play cross continent like OW. i just resubbed yesterday
21:56:13 <Cane> https://clips.twitch.tv/BrightFragileOryxKappa
21:56:29 <Dot`> kitty kitty
21:57:08 <DuB`> No idea how to study for this last test tomorrow.
21:57:18 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
21:57:38 <DuB`> No textbook, lectures were really freeform and stuff
21:57:44 <DuB`> Hardly even have any notes
21:57:59 <Crisium> get with a classmate and combine your notes
21:58:12 <Micen> study by playing ranked OW
21:58:22 <DuB`> lul ranked
21:58:30 <Bio> ?biostream 
21:58:33 <Bio> one last run bois
21:58:47 <Dot`> 2 hour run pls
22:00:24 <Zounds> good stack today
22:00:25 <Zounds> was fun
22:01:01 <DuB`> Quite
22:02:18 <Zounds> I'll need to invite Beede to stack more often
22:02:23 <Zounds> He actually likes playing tanks
22:02:46 <DuB`> Was goodtime
22:03:03 <DuB`> Was a bit lower ranked than our usual 5stacks too :P
22:03:24 <Zounds> Yeah I never checked the ranks but I could feel it
22:18:08 <Camail> Cane  apparently i am so in tune with hollow knight that my body senses content patches
22:18:19 <Camail> because the third free dlc came out today
22:19:16 <Zounds> I'm looking forward to the day I finally buy Hollow Knight and get lost playing it
22:20:22 <Zounds> I remember randomly downloading Dust: An Elysian Tale off of Playstation+ and loving that game to bits
22:22:26 <Micen|Droid> Dust is a fun game 
22:22:53 <Micen|Droid> Even if your faerie companion is Satan itself in terms of voice acting
22:23:15 <Zounds> Yes my initial reaction was pretty bad to her
22:23:17 <Zounds> but she grew on me
22:23:26 <Zounds> now I think she's adorable
22:23:58 <Crisium> thats what made Darksiders awesome, your fairy companion is Mark Hamill
22:24:16 <Phearlock> Fidget was pretty hit or miss =P
22:24:22 <Micen|Droid> I'll have to play and see if my opinion has changed since it's been years
22:25:19 <Zounds> None of the voice acting is particularly high quality
22:25:34 <Zounds> but after spending time with the characters I just got used to it I suppose
22:25:53 <Zounds> and I wouldn't want it different :P
22:26:10 <Micen|Droid> Well that's a good sign. 
22:28:59 <Camail> oh, this isnt the content pack, this is a bonus update in between 2 and 3
22:29:11 <Camail> team cherry are probably the best game developers in the business right now
22:29:22 <Camail> them and cd projekt red are the best game devs atm
22:29:25 <Camail> easily
22:40:38 <Micen|Droid> I am happy. I still haven't experienced Hollow Knight except for like the so
22:41:00 <Micen|Droid> Splash art. So I should get a good experience when I play
22:53:55 <Cane> My turn maybe. https://www.twitch.tv/CaneCraft
22:54:10 <Bio> thanks 4 watchin my dudes
22:54:17 <Dot`> nlt even a host from bio, rude
22:55:05 <Bio> MY STREAM IS STILL UP MANG
22:55:10 <Bio> Music!
22:55:24 <Bio> and I odn't know how to host lol
23:00:25 <DuB`> SHD v Florida today, probably their best chance to get a win in this stage
23:03:02 <DuB`> I continue to hope...
