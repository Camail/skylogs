12:10:39 <Dot> i wonder how many ppl have been murdered by hedgehogs
12:17:45 <Runbunny> That depends on what you consider "murdered"
12:18:29 <Runbunny> I am fairly certain that people have died from trying to miss them when driving on the freeway and stuff
12:18:49 <Dot> very sneaky
12:30:52 <Runbunny> but like an actual fight versus a human, I don't think that has happened.
