18:32:20 <Micen|Droid> Yes skrm
18:33:01 <Micen|Droid> And I like to do big wide mindmaps when planning and paper is easier for thay
18:34:15 <Micen|Droid> Yes and where I live
18:34:31 <skrm> Why dont you speak like that
18:36:45 <Micen|Droid> Because I am from a great city far north of here
18:36:55 <Micen|Droid> And I have my familys accent
18:37:05 <Micen|Droid> Its called Chicago.
18:43:06 <Zounds> what is a redneck exactly
18:43:40 <Zounds> I love southern drawls
18:43:47 <Zounds> or the hollywood facsimile of one anyway
18:44:11 <Micen|Droid> Its technicality a reclaimed slur that constitutes farm workers who would work shirtless in the fields leading to a sun burned and red neck
18:45:02 <Zounds> I see!
18:45:07 <Micen|Droid> Now its more or less a country subculture involving heavy tobacco use, going "muddin", hunting and shooting guns
18:45:29 <Micen|Droid> While also keeping the farming roots it had
18:45:50 <Zounds> Sounds like a good time

20:40:05 <skrm> what would you say instead of sugarcube in scottish zounds
20:40:23 <skrm> is wanker the correct term or is that in england
20:48:58 <Zounds> wanker is more english though we can use it
20:49:03 <Zounds> though its not a term of endearment
20:50:21 <Zounds> I guess we could say "pet" or "hen" though usually it's women who would say that
21:00:57 <skrm> zounds you jolly old wanker
21:01:05 <skrm> i dont think i could be more endearing
21:06:01 <Zounds> yes wanker can be endearing in england and australia
21:06:15 <Zounds> not impossible here either like any insult but less common
21:07:33 <Zounds> I assume you know the verb "to wank" is to masturbate
