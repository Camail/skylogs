23:47:43 <Camail> man i cant figure out how to comfortably get to 400 all the time, getting like 370-380
23:48:49 <Camail> rapha destroyed them that game
23:49:57 <Cane> Camail, yeah I've been working on movement in custom games.
23:49:58 <Cane> Is hard.
23:50:37 <Cane> I've been relying on Crutch. Whenever I take the training wheels off though I slow right down.
23:50:47 <Cane> At least Slash is fun.
23:50:53 <Camail> getting speed is easy, but having control feels impossible
23:50:56 <Cane> Yep.
23:51:13 <Camail> and being able to get 400 immediately is nuts
23:51:28 <Cane> Well. I still struggle with the getting up to speed bit at times.
23:51:46 <Cane> Chaining strafe jumps into circle jumps into etc etc is brutal.
23:52:48 <Camail> if you run diagonally its pretty easy to
23:53:09 <Camail> so i think when they start running they turn sideways just to get that initial diagonal acceleration
23:53:19 <Camail> then i guess transition into strafe jumps
23:53:25 <Camail> dont really know at that point
23:54:22 <Cane> I've been learning the 90 degree turn jump to get up to speed right away, seems to be the most consistent way of doing it.
23:54:28 <Camail> lg feels like garbage vs protection
23:54:29 <Cane> So far it consistently rams me into walls tho.
23:54:59 <Camail> yea the actual directional control comes from strafing, but the mouse movements are pretty strict
23:55:24 <Cane> I need to just grind it for a week, but that's effort.
23:57:40 <Camail> yea, but it's just better to just do it in a match
23:58:12 <Camail> gonna have to juggle everything anyway, and being a lab monkey isn't that satisfying in this game
23:58:21 <Camail> unless you're already good
23:58:44 <Camail> these fade away rails are great
