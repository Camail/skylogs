14:03:11 <reification> ISA = tax free investment/savings account
14:03:50 <skram> Why didnt your investment qualify? Did you fail the drug test?
14:04:44 <reification> it was a warrant which are considered too speculative :(

14:35:36 <Zounds> I didn't even get much input on where the circles where going
14:35:42 <skram> are you planning something again
14:35:44 <Zounds> I just got told where to put them
14:35:50 <skram> very suspicious
14:35:56 <Zounds> Naw I was mapping a deployment
14:42:33 <Zounds> Do you want to do more of the comp OW this evening skram?
14:42:59 <skram> sure sure
14:43:20 <skram> gonna go watch a hockey game first though
14:43:25 <Zounds> Hopefully we can get cris and dub too
14:44:07 <Zounds> I have my doubts about jakey boy though since he's sitting pretty in masters
14:44:19 <Zounds> Only when he's about to decay will he deign to play with us peasants
14:49:02 <skram> ya i guess he got what he wanted so he wont bother no more
14:49:14 <skram> which is sorta shitty i guess
14:52:48 <Zounds> Nah I wouldn't wanna force him to play if he didn't want to
14:53:24 <Zounds> Comp can be a bit draining compared to QP so if you're not in the mood for it there's no point
14:55:27 <Zounds> I'll soon be a "dps main" by playtime in comp
14:56:01 <skram> heck yeah
14:56:04 <skram> we need one of those
14:56:21 <Zounds> Yeah
14:56:44 <Zounds> Means I can insta lock dps every game no matter what
14:56:49 <Zounds> And screech at anyone who questions me
14:57:42 <skram> yup

21:10:35 <Camail> dort you watch critical role yet
21:10:55 <Bio> i'm at the break now
21:12:30 <Camail> this campaign is turning out interesting
21:12:52 <Camail> they are taking their characters seriously, so the group still doesnt trust each other
21:13:16 <Camail> but i bet in their home game they were so new they quickly let their irl friendships make the characters form a cohesive group
21:13:38 <Bio> yeh 
21:13:39 <Bio> its fun
21:13:41 <Camail> because after 12 episodes, that's kinda as many sessions as they had in campaign 1 pre-stream
21:14:20 <Camail> they played once every few months before the stream, so we get to see a more thorough growth that comes from a slower pace at the beginning
21:14:59 <Camail> nott is the BEST
21:15:27 <Bio> vod watching is the best
