00:41:45 <Camail> i had pizza
01:05:38 <reimeuk> night all
01:23:02 <skrma> describe the pizza, camail
01:23:17 <Camail> it was a sausage pizza
01:23:29 <Camail> the pizza guy dropped it and it looked like a burn victim
01:23:32 <Camail> but it was still good
01:23:39 <skrma> what sort of sausage
01:23:53 <Camail> there is one kind of sausage on american pizza
01:24:07 <skrma> oh
01:24:10 <Camail> it was just a normal new york style pizza, but tasty
01:24:19 <skrma> pepperoni is sausage?
01:24:34 <Camail> thats heresy
01:24:40 <Camail> dont let th epolice hear you type that
01:24:51 <skrma> have you ever purchased a pepperoni
01:24:54 <skrma> it comes in sausage form
01:25:10 <Camail> DuB`  call 911
01:25:15 <Camail> we have a citizen's arrest
01:25:28 <Camail> please put this man in jail
01:26:23 <Camail> but no, we just call it a pepperoni, pizza has it's own world of words
01:26:50 <Camail> sausage is a singular thing, there is only one sausage and everyone know what you're talking about
01:27:32 <Camail> we dont even call the cheese mozzarella, its just cheese
01:27:43 <Camail> unless you plan on deviating, which is rarely a good idea
01:27:51 <skrma> thats so weird camail
01:27:56 <skrma> i know you have different cheeses
01:28:05 <Camail> yea but not for pizza
01:28:06 <skrma> many of whom are perfectly acceptable on pizza
01:28:11 <Camail> it has it's own cultural bubble
01:28:36 <Camail> The Pizza Place is like...it's like a church?
01:28:54 <Camail> you dont ask what the Eucharist is made of
01:29:13 <Camail> what kind of wine is that? who cares
01:29:19 <skrma> ...
01:29:34 <Camail> pizza is made of simple, atomic parts
01:29:44 <skrma> i think someone needs to calm down with the pizza fetishism
01:30:30 <Camail> it cant be helped, its just there, being pizza
01:30:38 <Camail> with its Cheese and Sausage
01:30:56 <skrma> uncultured
01:31:06 <Camail> no, the opposite
01:31:14 <skrma> you wont entertain the idea of different cheeses yet you put pineapple on it?
01:31:17 <skrma> thats fucked up cam
01:31:25 <Camail> it is so drenched in cultural memory that it encompasses your mind
01:32:07 <Camail> most people dont eat fruits on pizza
01:32:40 <Camail> but i'm mostly talking about the word choice, and why we make those choices
01:33:25 <Camail> i've had all sorts of pizzas, most of them bad
01:33:45 <Camail> and i live near chicago so i have a looser definition of pizza
01:34:33 <skrma> this elitism is killing me cam
01:34:44 <skrma> pizza is just stuff on a circle with some cheese
01:35:36 <Camail> there is not a single place in america where, if you ask for a cheese pizza, they will ask which kind
01:36:12 <Camail> thats how embedded the pizza lexicon has become
01:36:44 <Camail> if you talk about a cheese platter, macaroni and cheese, cheese fondue, then it's up for grabs
01:36:54 <Camail> cheese means something compeltely different in that world
01:37:20 <Camail> but the Pizza World has one meaning, one purpose, one forward facing direction
01:37:22 <skrma> thats because theres like 7 million different types of cheese, cam
01:38:13 <Camail> when the word Pizza enters a sentence, there is a paradigm shift in any american's mind
01:38:35 <skrma> maybe what you actually need is to calm the fuck down
01:38:38 <Camail> where if you say cheese or sausage, we all know whats gonna happen, no further details are required
01:38:59 <Camail> clams are terrible on pizza
01:39:04 <skrma> very limited
01:39:10 <skrma> oh yeah
01:39:20 <skrma> fish in general is no thanks
01:39:49 <Camail> i was tricked into eating an anchovy pizza and i threw up after 2 pieces
01:39:59 <skrma> good
01:40:19 <skrma> vomiting is what happens when you ingest POISON
01:52:22 <Camail> oh, so the rimworld pawn who kept cheating on her husband divorced him once i finished building the ship to leave
01:52:37 <Camail> my shooters have killed...hundred of people
01:52:46 <Camail> but she is the worst human in my colony
01:57:11 <skrma> you should shoot her
02:14:29 <Camail> she is a good colonist, but a bad person
02:16:53 <Camail> it would've been much better if he broke up with her, he's like my second favorite pawn
02:26:40 <DuB`> Whoa
02:26:43 <DuB`> Pizza, huh
02:27:53 <DuB`> Hahaha
02:27:58 <DuB`> I should get rimworld
02:36:20 <Camail> it is quite fun

04:11:55 <Camail> so many raids
04:12:23 <Camail> but no major set back yet, 10 days to go
04:15:47 <DuB`> Is there a "very easy" mode? :P
04:20:35 <Camail> yes
04:20:43 <Camail> it has the full range of difficulties
04:20:53 <Camail> from never being attacked, to always being attacked
04:21:15 <Camail> launching the ship is the end game, where it ramps up raids
04:21:28 <Camail> i'm playing on medium, the lowest of the real difficulties
04:23:21 <Camail> and also i can help give you basic directions
04:26:26 <Camail> for example, these boys sure do love doing air raids right in the middle of 15 turrets
04:26:31 <Camail> they aren't very smart
04:45:20 <Camail> there's also a ton of mods that can 1. make it easier 2. make it harder 3. make it different
04:45:48 <Camail> dragon dicks are a real thing that a real person thought would be a good mod
