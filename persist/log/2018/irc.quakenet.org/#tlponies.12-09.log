05:16:21 <Crisium> why not
05:17:36 <skrm> Why would you need to build super expensive nuclear reactors when we have cheap and abundant hydroelectric energy?
05:17:53 <Crisium> cause you can make super heroes from the radiation
05:19:04 <skrm> so thats why there are so many russian super heroes huh
