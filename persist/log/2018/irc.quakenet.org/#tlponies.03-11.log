10:46:15 <Cane> I've been wanting a space game thing for a while but I dunno what to think of that one.
10:46:31 <Phearlock> It's best described as Mount n blade in space.
10:46:37 <Cane> Wat.
10:46:45 <Cane> Excuse me, I need a moment to process this.
10:46:56 <Cane> Okay, how can I get space butter?
10:47:01 <Phearlock> you got your little ship, your fleet (and you have to worry about fuel and supplies)
10:47:17 <Phearlock> Can salvage wrecks, go survey planets, hunt bounties (most fun)
10:47:35 <Phearlock> Get more ships, customize the shit out of all the ships.
10:47:53 <Phearlock> AI is excellent and will try to win instead of mindlessly fly at you
10:49:11 <Cane> How's the combat?
10:49:48 <Phearlock> I'd call it the best I've seen in a 2D spaceship game. But I'll try be a bit more descriptive
10:51:22 <Phearlock> you basically have a "heat" bar that fills up as you do stuff. Firing weapons, using your shields, taking damage to shields, some ship systems all build flux. At max flux you overload and cannot return fire (ohdear). Some ships are better at shield tanking or armor tanking.
10:51:56 <Cane> Do you have to "vent" it in combat cleverly?
10:52:20 <Cane> I've played a game that sorta does that.
10:52:25 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
10:52:36 <Phearlock> There is an active vent that shuts down weapons and shields to dump flux rapidly. Or you can simply not fire and drop your shields and let it go away slower, but without leaving yourself open
10:53:38 <Phearlock> Firing weapons and taking beam damage on shields generates soft flux, which can be dissapated without dropping your shields. Projectile hits to shields and some ship systems generate hard flux that you have to drop your shields to get rid of.
10:53:50 <Phearlock> (way to prevent ships from simply sitting in their shields forever)
10:55:28 <Phearlock> There are different weapon types (ballistic, energy, missiles), damage types (fragmentation, energy, kinetic, high explosive) and you typically spend a lot of time fiddling with ship loadouts.
10:56:23 <Phearlock> It's deep enough that the community has done a few AI vs AI fleet battle tourneys where players pit custom built fleets against each other.
10:57:51 <skrm> Dot
10:58:00 <Phearlock> Next major patch will add colonization and colony management.
10:58:00 <Dot> Jonas
10:58:18 <skrm> how was dnd
10:58:34 <Dot> just not the same without you skram
10:59:25 <skrm> did something kool happen
10:59:43 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
10:59:47 <Dot> many things
11:00:25 <Cane> Okay. Guess I'll download Starsector today/tomorrow and give it a shot.
11:00:39 <Cane> How big is the game? Is it open ended or does it have a campaign or what?
11:00:53 <Phearlock> It is open ended.
11:00:53 <Cane> You mentioned M&B, is it like that where you just do stuff until you get bored?
11:01:09 <Phearlock> Yeah generally, then you make another save and try a different faction or faction mod
11:01:24 <Phearlock> The 4x mod Nexelerin that lets you take over planets does add a win condition
11:01:30 <Cane> Oh neat.
11:01:31 <Phearlock> Of conquering all the planets
11:02:03 <Phearlock> Another mod adds a line of special bounty missions that are harder than usual which is also a cool thing to do
11:02:36 <Cane> Can you save/load?
11:02:43 <Phearlock> Yes
11:03:53 <Phearlock> The beginner guide http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=13115.0
11:04:03 <Phearlock> + the ingame tutorial should be plenty good to get you started
11:04:18 <Phearlock> otherwise there is a very good discord community up if you want to be pelted with advice.
11:05:04 <Cane> Hah, curious.
11:05:29 <Phearlock> I'd suggest going vanilla for your first playthrough, but mods increase the lifespan of this game tenfold
11:06:00 <Cane> Oh neat, more M&B-y-ness, you can focus on either being a good fighter yourself, or leadership skills to command a flotilla?
11:06:08 <Phearlock> Yes
11:06:23 <Cane> Man I hope this game plays well because I'm going to love it if it's well presented.
11:06:47 <Phearlock> Commands in combat are typically quite loose though. The AI has a lot of free reign to do what it wants even if you give it a command.
11:07:09 <Phearlock> And they're more influencing its behavior and objective than directly micromanaging it
11:08:19 <Phearlock> (example, telling a ship to escort another can actually be very dangerous in starsector as the ship told to escort will put itself in harms way in order to protect its escort target, whereas otherwise it would be free to pull back and vent flux on its own)
11:09:15 <Phearlock> the game does expect you to take ship losses though and there's lots of ways to give yourself a high chance of recovering a destroyed ship either through skills, officer skills, or hullmods in the outfitting screen.
11:09:34 <Phearlock> Though damaged ships may not perform as well as they used to....
11:12:21 <Phearlock> Oh and my best newbie advice is: Don't get a slow ship.
11:12:31 <Phearlock> Early game you will proooobably be running away
11:12:34 <Phearlock> from a lot of things
11:13:33 <Cane> I see you can start with two ships. The guide says to get the Wolf or whatever, but if I went with the other one with more cargo space, could I take it slow for a bit and explore and make money scavenging or hauling shit until I've got my bearings?
11:16:17 <Phearlock> Yes, I'd suggest buying a dram for more range and checking the comms boards on plants for scanning missions
11:16:37 <Phearlock> as those are a good way to do some exploring while getting a nice payout for a small fleet.
11:16:54 <Phearlock> planets* not plants.
11:18:59 <Cane> Scanning plant. "Oh no, not again." That's odd.
11:22:42 <Phearlock> And yeah the wolf is a bit more exciting as it has a blink teleporter as its ship system, and is quite fast for that good "running away" thing.
11:23:06 <Phearlock> but the wayfarer is what I usually pick as well as it will earn you more money if you know what you're doing =P
11:34:12 <Dot> skrm, are you feeling better?
11:34:35 <skrm> throat's alright but im still a bit woozy
11:50:38 <skrm> the lunch lady left me some chilli con carne

16:30:36 <skrm> I talked to benny the danish person, and he told me he had to work in sweden for like 2-3 months so he brought a pallet of beer
16:30:48 <skrm> and apparently the customs guy thought that was a reasonable amount
16:30:55 <CockRoach|42> haha
16:31:08 <CockRoach|42> it's probably considered breakfast for a dane
16:31:41 <Runbunny> It is. like you need at least 6 pallets of beer for it to be suspecious.
16:31:56 <CockRoach|42> "it's for a wedding"

16:35:29 <skrm> as far as i understand it you can import as much as you want if its for either personal use or you have a proper excuse like a wedding
16:35:32 <CockRoach|42> sorry for letting you stand outside for half an hour
16:35:34 <Runbunny> CockRoach|42, if they try to sell you something, you try to sell them something even more absurd back.
16:35:35 <skrm> in the EU
16:35:40 <skrm> or schengen or whatevs
16:35:58 <CockRoach|42> Runbunny: i avoid opening the door as much as i can
