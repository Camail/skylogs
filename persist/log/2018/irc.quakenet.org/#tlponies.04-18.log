15:51:38 <DuB`> Horses are for eating
15:51:46 <Bio> stahp trolling dub
15:51:51 <DuB`> I am great dot, just got out of my last lecture for the semester
15:52:00 <DuB`> Gonna do a bit of test prep and plej a bunch
15:52:05 <Dot> woohoo
15:53:19 <DuB`> Wat to plej, though...
15:53:44 <DuB`> I have lots of fun new goals in warframe, need lots of OW lootboxes before event end, and want to get back to some factori too!
15:53:45 <Dot> so many choices
15:54:00 <DuB`> Also DNDN!
15:54:01 <DuB`> -N
15:54:12 <Dot> you must think on what you want to plej
15:54:28 <Dot> or dont
15:54:41 <DuB`> I wanna do my desert boi :P
15:54:52 <Dot> a druidy one?
15:55:08 <DuB`> I thought I wanted to rogue but after looking at the actual mechanics and stuff I think ranger actually fits better?
15:55:10 <DuB`> Mebbe
15:55:56 <Dot> deserty ranger, hmm, intresting\
15:56:05 <Dot> is there a subclass you like there?
15:56:21 <Dot> or is it just the gernal rangerness
15:56:45 <DuB`> Um!
15:57:08 <Dot> dub, have you got Xanathars?
15:57:15 <DuB`> What!
15:57:23 <DuB`> I do not have that thing.
15:57:26 <Dot> the newish book with all the new subclasses
15:57:30 <Dot> wow
15:57:33 <DuB`> No sir.
15:57:39 <Dot> https://rpg.rem.uz/Dungeons%20%26%20Dragons/D%26D%205th%20Edition/

15:57:53 <Dot> under core
15:58:11 <DuB`> Infinity pdfs
15:58:13 <DuB`> Uhhh
16:00:58 <DuB`> From the basic one, hunter ranger or assassin rogue fits the style of the desert bois best and would be fun, I think.
16:01:02 <DuB`> Want as few magicks as possible.
16:02:15 <DuB`> Magic is TABOO and UNNATURAL
16:02:17 <DuB`> YUCKY
16:02:22 <Dot> oh dear
16:02:33 <Bio> *notes to cast many spells at dub*
16:02:35 <Dot> but all rangers do magic

16:26:43 <skram> Yeah that looks good
16:35:10 <DuB`>  you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use
16:35:10 <DuB`> your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5
16:35:10 <DuB`> feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and
16:35:10 <DuB`> you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. 
16:35:14 <DuB`> Whoops
