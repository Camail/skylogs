04:23:02 <Cane> Bio, Phant showed me the adorable Ori sprite he made for LttP Rando. It's gonna be in the next version and I'm gonna need you to use it.
04:24:18 <Bio> oh shit
04:24:20 <Bio> yesssir
04:24:36 <Bio> didn't know phant was into the alttpr scene
04:25:08 <Bio> love ori
04:25:24 <Bio> will have to rotate between him and zora
04:25:49 <Bio> F I S H
04:25:58 <Cane> Yeah man.
04:26:09 <Cane> Apparently he was on pace for the best time in a tournament until he choked due to nerves.
04:26:44 <Bio> can relate =D
04:26:54 <Cane> I thought you might. =)
04:27:02 <Bio> theres a cash prize tourney coming up too
04:27:03 <Cane> Was talking to him about nerves actually.
04:27:19 <Cane> Like how I would be on WR pace in Keen 4 several times and just choke on Pit because I'm in "Holy shit don't fuck this up" mode.
04:27:50 <Cane> It's just a thing you have to get used to and get over.
04:27:56 <Cane> Now that you've had it, the healing can begin. <3
04:28:23 <Cane> Eventually you'll be all "whatever, I've choked 99 times this month, if I choke again I'll get a voucher for Wendy's."
04:28:30 <Cane> And not care as much.
04:28:32 <Bio> haha
04:29:41 <Bio> i should look into getting a new controller, this one i'm using is having some input problems, especially with the a button
04:30:10 <Cane> Aw that sucks.
04:30:14 <Cane> What controller are you using?
04:30:33 <Bio> an older xbox one atm
