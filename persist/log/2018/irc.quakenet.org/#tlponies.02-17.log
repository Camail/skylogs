15:25:48 <Cane> <3
15:34:15 <Dot`> i just got an email saying you played NS2 yesterday cane
15:34:21 <Dot`> streamed*
15:34:26 -!- Zounds [webchat@cpc108453-cowc8-2-0-cust8.14-2.cable.virginm.net] has joined #tlponies
15:34:32 <Dot`> this is good song too cane
15:34:33 <Cane> I tried Dot`.
15:34:43 <Cane> Too much packetloss to stream at 5500 so I gave up.
15:34:47 <Cane> 30% dropped frames.
15:34:50 <Cane> Didn't even get to start playing.
15:35:14 <Dot`> we need to tlp stack ns2 again and full out team
15:35:16 <Dot`> that was fun
15:35:30 <Cane> It was! Gorge is great now btw.
15:35:36 <Cane> Recent patch made the babblers amazing.
15:35:39 <Dot`> they got buffed?
15:35:41 <Dot`> :D
15:35:59 <Dot`> belly sliding to victory
15:36:24 <Dot`> i still loved setting up at a corner and just holding off like 5 marines
15:36:42 <Dot`> then they would get the courage to charge and you would come past and kill them
15:36:46 <Dot`> good stuff
15:37:53 <Zounds> Yeh NS2 was fantastic
15:38:02 <Zounds> I'd stack that
15:38:47 <Zounds> Haven't played it since I got my 144Hz monitor
15:38:58 <Zounds> tracking lerks and skulks will be easier now
15:39:01 <Cane> Oh yeah, Gorges got buffed.
15:39:08 <Cane> Specifically babbler eggs got buffed.
15:39:27 -!- Crisium [~Crisium@24.3.158.64] has joined #tlponies
15:39:27 <Cane> Now the babblers actually do a lot of damage and marines have to backpedal and shoot them or they'll get munched apart.
15:39:36 <Cane> But more than that, you can put an almost-grown babbler egg on a surface
15:39:40 <Runbunny> Dot`, https://i.imgur.com/nuiP5IC.mp4
15:39:43 <Cane> and if a marine walks by it, it explodes for 40 damage + babblers come at them.
15:39:52 <Cane> It's a good safety net for the Gorge and a good OH FUCK SHIT for the marines.
15:40:28 <Cane> I guess after the success of Subnautica the devs just decided to go back and patch the game that got them where they are now, and patched NS2 like four days ago.
15:40:42 <Crisium> baby water snake?
15:41:03 <Zounds> Hi cris
15:41:06 <Cane> Nice banana.
15:41:10 <Crisium> howdy
15:41:46 <Zounds> The eternal problem with NS2 stacks is getting onto the same team and having a somewhat balanced game
15:41:51 <Zounds> And then there's the commander question
15:42:22 <Cane> Aye, that be the problem.
15:42:27 <Crisium> oh i bought NS2 when it was like $4, never installed it
15:42:41 <Dot`> cute ferret runbun
15:42:52 <Dot`> haha cane, exploding babbler eggs sound fun
15:43:04 <Cane> I remember when we used to stack NS2, was it Bloodynoob who would always just say screw it and go other team because we couldn't find a good way to full stack?
15:43:31 <Dot`> some of us always ended up on the wrong team
15:43:38 <Dot`> no matter how much we mashed F1
15:44:05 <Zounds> It might have been bloody
15:44:11 <Zounds> I think I did that a couple of times myself
15:44:18 <Cane> Yeah, it was just hard.
15:44:28 <Cane> But it was still fun being on Ventrilo or whatever we used then just laughing at killing each other.
15:44:52 <Dot`> at cane/zounds killing us*
15:44:58 <Zounds> Yeah it was one of the first games that actually inspired me to try and git gud at FPS
15:45:05 <Cane> At Dot` being the best support Gorge a person could ask for.
15:45:21 <Dot`> all i dreamed of was getitng the perfect belly slide
15:45:27 <Zounds> That and ruining Tribes:Ascend by playing sentinel all the time
15:45:35 <Cane> I miss Tribes.
15:45:42 <Cane> Not enough to install it and play it at its current state though.
15:45:46 <Dot`> trapping those poor marines by placing a gorge tunnel either ide of thier base
15:46:50 <Zounds> Yeah same Cane

15:48:41 <Crisium> yeh they stinky

18:22:30 <DuB`> I cannot play with you if you are at work
18:22:47 <skrm> I need to work so I can afford those 1300$ lego sets DuB` 
18:23:09 <DuB`> ???
18:23:27 <DuB`> Dun buy that
18:24:08 <DuB`> You could buy a WHOLE COMPUTER
18:24:22 <Dot`> lego is life
18:25:44 <skrm> Maybe I can do both
18:25:47 <DuB`> You could buy like 7 OW grandmaster accounts for that much
18:25:49 <DuB`> lolol

18:26:06 <Dot`> what can you do with a GM account? lose rank?
18:26:47 <Crisium> yes
18:26:56 <Crisium> and anger your teammates in the process because you're boosted
18:28:30 <skrm> That seems like an awful waste of money
18:28:50 <skrm> DuB` tell me where i can buy these grandmaster accounts
18:29:00 <skrm> i love wasting my hard earned skrilla
18:29:07 <DuB`> uh
18:29:08 <DuB`> ebay
18:31:44 <skrm> someone is selling an account that got 4016 in season 5 for like 300 dollarydoos
18:32:00 <DuB`> Very silly
18:32:18 <Crisium> lmao
18:32:24 <Crisium> skram sell your 4k account
18:32:26 <skrm> i did that too
18:32:33 <DuB`> I'd rather go have sushi for lunch every day for a month!
18:32:36 <DuB`> Mmmm
18:32:37 <skrm> yeh buuddy

18:34:09 <DuB`> No idea
18:34:16 <Zounds> Surely you'll just get violated if you try and play GM when you're a plat 
18:34:19 <DuB`> You should try zounds and let us know what it's like
18:35:14 <DuB`> Well my group project meeting today just got cancelled, guess I'll be playing all day today again :D

18:36:02 <skrm> Yeah zounds probably has the fattest stacks of all the pons
18:36:06 <Bio> fite me
18:36:14 <skrm> he should get us all gm accounts so we can topple harder than ever before
18:36:27 <Bio> its what we know, toppling
18:36:59 <Zounds> We're way better than we used to be
18:37:06 <Zounds> When we actually try somewhat
18:37:08 <DuB`> Ye
18:37:12 <DuB`> We even have FUN
18:37:25 <skrm> sometimes we graze towards accidental teamplay
18:37:38 <Bio> but this spooks the pony
18:37:42 <carcinisation> we used to stack when i was silver, now i'm shiny silver aka plat
18:37:43 <Bio> and they return to grazing alone
18:38:30 <Zounds> reif you're probably the most OW savvy of all the pons
18:38:55 <skrm> excuse u im a grand master player and my account is worth 300 dollars
18:39:21 <DuB`> skrm u dun even kno what a slambulance is

18:42:04 <DuB`> Anything that involves Moira is easy because OP
18:42:06 <skrm> i think we tried, i didnt know what it was and nobody would tell me until the end so i just kept on meiing or whatever

18:43:05 <DuB`> Moira has AOE Blob of Invincibility AND AOE Blob of Kill Everything
18:43:08 <skrm> tank meta, come back to me
18:43:09 <DuB`> ezez
18:43:15 <Bio> lucio is basically almost always sanic mode
18:43:20 <Zounds> I didn't know what it was either skrm
18:43:26 <Zounds> But I was ashamed
18:43:41 <Bio> there is no shame in not knowing the prostrats, as we are not pros

18:45:37 <skrm> I wish QP would let us do duplicate heroes again
18:46:04 <skrm> 2 moiras! 3 moiras! ALL MOIRAS ALL THE TIME
18:46:41 <DuB`> That's what No Limits mode is for and there's a reason it's a barren wasteland. 
18:47:24 <skrm> I know we used to do double reinhardts on hanamura with some measure of success
18:47:48 <Phearlock> hm, could you do ability draft in OW?
18:48:06 <skrm> or the double or sometimes tripple mccree thing they did in competetive
18:48:16 <skrm> fuckin' envyus liked doing that
18:48:30 <Zounds> I'd like that phear but it could easily get out of hand
18:48:36 <DuB`> Pro koth was guaranteed 2lucio 2tracer 2winston
18:48:40 <Zounds> Give reaper tracers blink for example
18:48:45 <skrm> haha
18:49:04 <DuB`> Only if he has the tracer voiceline too
18:49:06 <DuB`> WEEE
18:49:28 <skrm> captains mode could be cool though
18:50:54 <skrm> might need a way bigger hero pool for that though
18:51:04 <skrm> or maybe just the ability to ban heroes
18:53:29 <Zounds> Cane mentioned he might up for stacking a bit to practice his tanking
18:53:47 <Zounds> Someone who actually wants to play a tank would be fabulous
18:54:18 <DuB`> And DOT said maybe saturday? :O
18:54:54 <carcinisation> :O
18:56:00 <Bio> pls
