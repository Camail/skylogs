00:46:21 <Phearlock_> I am having an unresonable amount of fun with Them fighting herds
00:46:41 <Phearlock_> More than I expected to have for sure
00:47:14 <Phearlock_> Also all the characters are adorable
00:47:18 <Phearlock_> and I want to hug them
00:47:25 <Dot`> ive only really checked out the characters so far
00:47:37 <Dot`> i know nothing really about playing fighting games
00:47:50 <Phearlock_> Me neither, there was that brief stint with SFIV
00:48:04 <Phearlock_> And casual smash
00:48:22 <Phearlock_> So I'm happy if I manage any of the intermediate combo stuff at all in a match.
00:48:33 <Phearlock_> Super meter doesn't exist unless I use it by accident etc
00:48:36 <Phearlock_> But hey it's fun =P
00:48:51 <Dot`> i have no idea what even  basic combo is 
00:49:14 <Phearlock_> The training mode is really good
00:49:25 <Phearlock_> Has a lot of fancy stuff I have no idea what is

00:53:58 <Bio> man, the shaking in the lobby is a bit much
00:59:06 <Camail> ah fuck
00:59:11 <Camail> I'm gonna have to buy it, arent i
00:59:26 <Camail> you guys need someone to help you with anime fighters
00:59:33 <Phearlock> If you want, i don't think that many from here are playing it atm
00:59:53 <Phearlock> Some animations and voice stuff is still WIP etc if you care about that.
01:00:28 <Camail> I've played skullgirls when there were literally place holder sketches for the dlc characters
01:00:33 <Dot`> there is a zebra in one background!
01:00:39 <Phearlock> There is dot!
01:00:48 <Dot`> best map
01:00:57 <Camail> also probably gonna be a dlc zebra
01:00:59 <Phearlock> Hopefully one of the next chars is going to be a zebra.
01:01:09 <Camail> i've never heard any rumors but they do want to do dlc
01:01:28 <Phearlock> I've heard there are more chars in development yeah
01:01:37 <Dot`> goat!
01:02:15 <Phearlock> I've been playing the dragonhorse
01:02:16 <Camail> at least now i dont have to play pinkie
01:02:22 <Camail> though we all fucking know it's the llama
01:02:31 <Dot`> haha
01:02:36 <Camail> and like...we can't erase that so it's really not possible
01:02:37 <Phearlock> Because I wanted to try something else than just playing zoning chars again.
01:02:40 <Phearlock> Going in is fun!
01:02:50 <Camail> never stop going in
01:02:56 <Camail> yea lots of dashes
01:03:03 <Dot`> a llama that licks ppl
01:03:23 <Camail> not sure who i would play
01:04:55 <Camail> probably aj because anti air lasso is kind of my jam
01:05:10 <Camail> i really dont like faust-type item characters like the llama
01:05:32 <Phearlock> Cowgirlcow does look great.
01:07:48 <Camail> eh I'll think about it
01:07:53 <Camail> if more people get it I'll bite

01:10:17 <Bio> critrooolll
01:10:32 <Camail> all the skullgirls players on my friends list already own this game, lul
01:10:58 <Camail> and dot
01:12:12 <Dot`> pls
01:12:21 <Dot`> i had skullgirls open beta
01:12:36 <Camail> wasnt it free
01:12:43 <Camail> didnt i give it to you
01:13:12 <Dot`> maybe you gave me access to beta?
01:13:19 <Dot`> thats possible
01:13:21 <Camail> probably
01:13:44 <Camail> because you only got access for buying it or being given a code by someone who bought it
01:13:56 <Dot`> i need to watch the previos crit role too
01:14:06 <Camail> pls
01:14:22 <Dot`> getting caught up on Court of swords, then back to crit role
01:20:17 <Camail> oh dot, if you use keyboard dont use wasd
01:20:28 <Camail> use asd[space]
01:21:00 <Camail> you always want you fingers on the down direction
01:21:03 <Dot`> oo, i see
01:21:22 <Dot`> and defiinitly not arrow keys right?
01:22:01 <Camail> no, for the same reason
01:22:26 <Camail> using right hand for movements isnt bad but you gotta use four buttons you always have free
01:23:05 <Dot`> currently i set up jkl for attacks and magic on N
01:23:25 <Dot`> because i had no idea what to use instead of N
01:23:29 <Camail> i would use the keypad, gives your arms some breathing room
01:24:04 <Camail> there are two configurations you can use for the buttons
01:24:11 <Camail> lmh, then magic on the bottom row
01:24:16 <Camail> lm then h and magic
01:24:20 <Camail> light medium and hard
01:25:25 <Camail> I'll probably play lmh all in one row because street fighter is similar
01:25:37 <Camail> but it all depends on preference, marvel has 2 in each row
01:25:50 <Camail> and there arent any assist so it truly is a 4 button game

02:47:25 <DuB`> Woohoo, $520 in tax refund
02:47:30 <Camail> nice
02:47:37 <DuB`> Maybe I can afford mouse replacement and rent next month now. :P
02:47:40 <DuB`> wew
02:47:54 <Camail> is your mouse broken?
02:48:02 <DuB`> Think so
02:48:05 <Camail> mice are the things i replace the least
02:48:13 <Camail> even when they break
02:48:24 <Camail> i didnt have a scroll wheel for years, even this one is shit
02:48:26 <DuB`> It ignores a ton of movement if I move it quickly at all
02:48:28 <Camail> razer mice are kinda bad
02:48:39 <Camail> hmm yea thats rough
02:48:58 <Camail> though it could be a surface problem if your mouse pad is dirty, like mine was
02:49:13 <DuB`> My full mousepad is about a 360 if I move at a slower speed, but if I flick across the whole pad I barely turn 90 lol
02:49:25 <DuB`> Tried my brother's newer pad, same thing
02:50:04 <Camail> maybe try re-installing drivers
02:50:50 <Camail> what mouse is it
02:50:56 <DuB`> razer taipan
02:51:14 <Camail> ah, did you calibrate the mousepad
02:51:29 <DuB`> ya
02:54:41 <reification> what is the quickest way to get xp in overwatch?
02:55:50 <DuB`> Grouped up, consecutive games
02:56:00 <DuB`> Not much difference between modes, I think.
02:56:13 <DuB`> And long games give plenty more to be worth it
02:58:12 <reification> ah ok
02:59:23 <Camail> yea the only thing i'd try is reinstalling the driver, other than that ur probably boned
02:59:27 <DuB`> Also get at least one gold medal each game. :P
02:59:30 <Camail> also never get razer stuff again
02:59:39 <DuB`> mhmm
02:59:51 <Camail> i used to have a razer moue, pad, and headset, now I'm planning on having none
03:00:10 <Camail> hard pads are the worse invention
03:00:18 <reification> night all
03:00:59 <DuB`> nnreef
03:01:15 <Crisium> nn
03:11:34 <DuB`> Might borrow my brother's deathadder while he's gone sometimes to see if I can get used to a slightly larger mouse
03:11:40 <DuB`> All of mine have been quite small in the past
03:12:40 <Phearlock> Been using logitech stuff for years now. Currently on a G502, I was a bit skeptical about the design being a bit overdone
03:12:45 <Phearlock> But the mouse itself has been fantastic
03:16:29 <DuB`> g502 is quite heavy?
03:16:40 <DuB`> Like 125g vs 85g on the g403
03:16:48 <DuB`> Ach
03:16:59 <Camail> i use the death adder, i got used to the size, want to go smaller once this breaks
03:17:42 <Camail> zowie makes smaller mice
03:20:24 <DuB`> zowie fk2 is small and abidextrious, closer to what I have now
03:20:35 <Camail> I'd suggest looking at that
03:20:43 <Camail> i tried the fk1 but didnt like how the mouse click felt
03:20:55 <Camail> the deathadder has a feather touch of a click
03:21:24 <DuB`> I don't like how TALL the DA is
03:21:27 <DuB`> Feels weird
03:21:48 <Camail> yea its big, i dont suggest getting it
03:30:40 <Camail> also mouse bungees are great if you aren't getting wireless
03:37:19 <DuB`> Hmm fk2 seems nice and more like what I have now but I kinda feel like experimenting, g403 would be more... fresh? :P And is $10 cheaper
03:42:20 <Camail> try the g403 and see if you like it, return policies are generous
03:43:44 <DuB`> Yup yup
03:43:50 <DuB`> 2 day sheeping woo
03:45:16 <Camail> i live next to like 2-3 amazon warehouses, sometimes 2 day shipping is 1 day shipping
03:45:25 <DuB`> oooh
03:47:21 <Camail> it almost makes up for living next to amazon warehouses
03:47:35 <DuB`> :o ?
03:47:42 <Camail> but yea, thanks to the gov't you have your money back
03:47:45 <DuB`> Traffic or?
03:47:53 <Camail> trafffffic
03:47:55 <Camail> lots of semis

06:01:59 <Camail> also it costs less for me because i own skullgirls
06:02:05 <Camail> i didnt even know steam could do that
06:05:31 <Camail> also i might get this sale infinite times so if someone wanted to give me $11.24 to gift the game to them it might work
06:05:37 <Camail> seems a bit sketchy tho
06:07:05 <Camail> 11.94* apparently tax was included in that number
06:07:57 <Camail> yea i can just...get it for 25% off, regardless
06:08:04 <Camail> anyone who happens to own sg can do the same
06:08:19 <Camail> and if you got it when it was like 90% off you basically get a net balance of 0

11:05:18 <Phearlock> .tell Camail that's about as many tries as it takes me to do the intermediate combos! The llama is cute.
11:06:58 <Dot`> same, except begginer combos
11:07:15 <Dot`> thats a lie actually, i just cant get any air things working
11:07:58 <Phearlock> The thing that made me not be able to jump cancel forward was forgetting to let go of the down input in time.
11:08:18 <Phearlock> It just means do a forward jump as soon as you can after the last move you did.
11:08:38 <Dot`> i cant string 2 attacks in a row that have air in them
11:08:53 <Phearlock> Try turn the game speed down to 50%

11:09:04 <Dot`> hmm
11:09:05 <Phearlock> Yeah in training

20:04:53 <Micen> shoo-be-doo?
20:05:08 <Phearlock> That was what I wrote on the time capsule you leave when you're done, yes.
20:05:10 <Bio> back
20:05:15 <Bio> such a nice day
20:05:39 <Bio> 67 f in feb
20:05:50 <Camail> yea today was nice in the midwest
20:06:05 <Camail> did you end up looking up the tablet location phear?
20:06:15 <Bio> gonna get some rain here tonight
20:06:17 <Bio> but alas
20:06:49 <Phearlock> Oh it wasn't the tablet I needed, just the final few plants.
20:06:55 <Camail> ahh
20:07:07 <Micen> little bit more chilly here, low 60s high 50s
20:07:18 <Camail> i actually knew where they all were other than the one that was in that same location
20:07:55 <Phearlock> I really hadn' been looking at plants xD
20:08:02 <Camail> i had the shroom in my inventory for some reason
20:09:00 <Camail> yea i had all the sections divided by the compass in my head, so i just kept going in those directions until i found the plants
20:09:09 <Camail> i almost looked the last one up
20:09:24 <Camail> because  i had those food and water shortages i never explored the tank
20:10:09 <Camail> also one of the time capsules i got had a fucking ion battery in it so i had less to build, despite not being in shortage for those cubes
20:10:13 <Camail> what did you put in yours?
20:10:47 -!- Golly [~Golly@1.92-221-121.customer.lyse.net] has joined #tlponies
20:10:54 <Camail> i did a noah's arc of end game materials, just to give the "wtf is this woah what" factor
20:11:25 <Phearlock> Quality of life modules, Solar charger for seamoth, jump jet module for the prawn, Storage module for both of those, and my cat poster (so that someone somewhere will have two!)
20:14:13 <Phearlock> I considered dropping a ball of enzyme 42 in it because I wonder if that would break the game at all.
20:14:20 <Phearlock> But I'd never know!
20:15:03 <Golly> i put the car and two batteries
20:20:48 <Camail> I am mildly annoyed that the master combos arent even close to optimal
20:21:33 <Camail> i have been trying for like 20 minutes and found a better variation

20:25:03 <Phearlock> The prawn suit can
20:25:15 <Camail> ahh
20:25:21 <Camail> that seems like an oversight
20:25:25 <Phearlock> Yes =P
20:26:06 <Dot`> NEEEEB
20:26:08 <Camail> i wonder if you can get a time capsule with the enzyme in in, rush tot he island, do the thing, and see if it still makes the ship blow up
20:26:18 <Camail> also i kinda want to look up the ban ending
20:26:22 <Camail> that i assume exists
20:26:25 <Camail> bad*
20:26:55 <Phearlock> I assume there's two? Depending on what you don't do before the end.
20:27:21 <Phearlock> Unless there's just some safeguard that doesn't let you end before doing it

20:48:27 <Camail> paprika has some fun ground loops
20:49:17 <Camail> i have barely even begun to mess with the items, but it isn't really faust rng style, its more like peach
20:49:31 <Camail> which i am cool with, i can work with that
20:53:30 <Camail> Dot` Phearlock  remember to do the combos on both p1 and p2 side, and to use realistic openers
20:53:48 <Dot`> i haveno idea what any of that mean
20:53:49 <Dot`> s
20:53:51 <Camail> its too easy to get bad muscle meory that doesnt trigger when you need it to because you arent replicating match scenarios
20:54:17 <Camail> a typical opener is gonna be a fast air move or a quick low
20:54:42 <Camail> so 2a is probably your only low normal
20:54:49 <Camail> at least it is for paprika
20:55:07 <Camail> player 1 and 2, dot
20:55:16 <Phearlock> I've been trying to, I also have the issue of practicing one combo too much and accidently doing inputs from it when practicing hte next one =P
20:55:27 <Camail> yea that happens
20:56:28 <Camail> also you are still doing small combos so it doesnt matter, but when you do full combos your opener might change how you do your end chain because you'll be hitting the juggle decay meter quicker
20:56:39 <Camail> WELCOME TO ANIME BOYS
20:56:47 <Dot`> AAAHHH
20:57:36 <Dot`> skram
20:57:39 <Camail> my brother had this issue too, where i can just vomit fgc terms

20:58:16 <Phearlock> I also dunno how to transition into using resources to extend combos (as I've mostly been playing Tianhuo).
20:58:33 <Phearlock> Seen some videoes of people doing insane things =P
20:58:36 <Camail> it seems supers are mostly used to end combos in this game
20:58:48 <Camail> the scaling is pretty low so it just adds damage
20:59:06 <Camail> also everyone has a meter burn where you can spend extra bars to do moree with the super? i ahvent messed with that a lot
20:59:14 <Camail> paprika gets free items which is neat
21:00:15 <Camail> tho paprika's is also an anti-zoner super where i can raw super any fireball
21:00:41 <Phearlock> Yeah can go up to 3 super charges. And seems everyone has an ability to burn at least 2 charges of that during a super if they want to.
21:02:05 <Camail> and throw is BC, which is really not my jam
21:02:16 <Camail> like i r eally dont like that but I'll have to deal with it

22:01:40 <Dot`> what book?
22:01:41 <Runbunny> I saw a sovietwomble stream planetside 2, maybe I should try that game?
22:01:51 <Runbunny> The last book in the malazan book of the fallen.
22:02:02 <Dot`> thats some dedication runbun
22:02:16 <Phearlock> Long time since I read that series, good stuff
22:02:20 <Dot`> zound splays plantside
22:02:28 <Runbunny> It's pretty good. I enjoy it.
22:04:12 <Runbunny> Is Zounds playing as the spandex aliens?

22:11:11 <Zounds> Same server too
22:11:20 <Camail> all it does is frame 1 reactions
22:11:36 <Camail> its better than practicing on a dummy sometimes but man
22:11:46 <Camail> anyone wanting a single player experience in this game is gonna have a sad time
22:12:07 <Dot`> hopefully its one of the things they are working on]
22:12:21 <Camail> i dont think they should, honestly
22:12:31 <Camail> too much work to make a really good ai, they need to do everything else
22:12:45 <Zounds> Micen: I also loved the original planetside
22:12:54 <Camail> its a simple game, everyone should be playing multiplayer anyway
22:12:56 <Zounds> Though I much prefer the actual fps mechanics of PLanetside 2
22:13:09 <Camail> also since its the z engine they have push block and push block guard cancel
22:13:14 <Zounds> But the metagame and general pace of Planetside 1 was good
22:13:22 <Camail> pbgc in this game seems waaaay fucking easier
22:13:44 <Dot`> is that good or bad?
22:14:07 <Phearlock> Not tried it much, but the multiplayer seems really nice
22:14:13 <Phearlock> the pixel lobbies are cute as hell
22:14:17 <Camail> its better, in a way
22:14:21 <Camail> defense is really strong in this game
22:14:36 <Camail> air and ground techs, low combo damage, very few set ups as far as i can see
22:14:42 <Camail> lots of neutral gonna happen in this game
22:14:59 <Crisium> ill have to try it sometime
22:15:01 <Crisium> probably this weekend

22:18:21 <Camail> some long normals, charge character, command grab

22:21:09 <Camail> she's a puppet character

22:22:04 <Zounds> Though the learning curve is actually really high
22:22:27 <Crisium> well im gonna go practice Mei and Sombra methinks
22:22:29 <Zounds> But I'm a 5 K:D+ turbovirgin so I can navigate it pretty well
22:22:33 <Runbunny> I probably won't, I am just killing time till the next PoE league, this friday.
22:22:40 <Runbunny> O:
22:22:44 <Runbunny> I don't know what that means.
22:22:56 <Zounds> It means I kill a lot of people and don't die much

22:31:16 <Zounds> I see I see
22:31:18 <Runbunny> Yeah I thought it was the arma videoes.
22:31:41 <Zounds> Planetside is pretty much Battlefield: Bad Company 2 but bigger
22:31:46 <Zounds> Less Arma
22:33:11 <Runbunny> Really?
22:33:34 <Runbunny> How do I get the "Carl Gustav" as fast as possible?
22:33:56 <Zounds> Take a time machine back a couple of years and use a decimator
22:34:07 <Zounds> Thankfully explosives vs infantry did get toned down a lot
22:36:55 <Runbunny> That was pretty dumb in bad company 2. "Hold this house", a house made of paper that the enemy can shoot and destroy with rocket launchers from 10 miles away.
22:37:14 <Runbunny> Sure, we'll hold it for all 2 seconds.
22:38:02 <Zounds> yes :(
22:38:16 <Zounds> Still my fave battlefield game of all time though except maybe 1942
22:38:28 <Zounds> large character models, less visual clutter
22:38:33 <Zounds> no prone
22:38:39 <Zounds> accurate guns
22:38:40 <Zounds> good shit
22:39:04 <Crisium> i love 3 and 4, but so much visual clutter
22:39:10 <Crisium> you can be staring at someone and not see them
22:39:52 <Phearlock> Something I didn't learn too quickly is that since FTH is going to be mostly online MP, simulating the input delay setting in training mode can be really useful
22:40:12 <Phearlock> (it's near the bottom of the training option list)
22:40:30 <Camail> I'd go at most to 2 or 3
22:40:38 <Camail> its almost a wast of time doing anything more
22:41:06 <Phearlock> Yeah most of my mp matches that haven't been super laggy have been fine at 1
22:41:10 <Phearlock> so that's what I've been using
22:41:17 <Phearlock> at least, today
22:41:21 <Phearlock> when I learned that this is a thing
22:41:23 <Phearlock> =P
22:43:01 <Camail> across the ocean will be a bit more

22:43:57 <Zounds> yeah Crisium i felt like I was shooting at the doritos more than the enemies character models in 3 and 4
22:44:05 <Zounds> I still quite liked them but meeeeh
22:48:39 <Camail> Phearlock  to make it easy you only need to learn two combos, one to convert throws into combos and one normal one
22:48:56 <Camail> learning every little possible combo in this game isn't gonna end up being efficient, most of them are useless
22:59:10 <Runbunny> What faction do I join Zounds and what server?

23:04:24 <DuB`> (Talking about the mountains) "They make me feel so small. They're kinda... intimidating, scary. I was freaking out a bit when I first started driving down from the airport"

23:17:11 <Camail> you purple apologist
23:17:34 <Dot`> i like the unicorn but im probably biased becuas etwilight
23:17:47 <Camail> oh gee, maybe
23:17:58 <DuB`> Oh gee
23:17:58 <Camail> and I'm totally palying paprika because i love charge characters
23:18:02 <Camail> no, none of us have a choice
23:18:12 <Camail> we play best pony
23:18:28 <Micen|Droid_> I need to get this game
23:19:32 <Camail> the coolest aprt of this game is that during character select there is a base musical track, and when you select a character it adds a track into it
23:19:49 <Camail> programmatic music layering sounds cool
23:21:45 <Dot`> blasphamy, best part is the Zebra
23:21:52 <Dot`> but the music is cool
23:21:57 <Micen|Droid_> That actually was the part I was hyped about cam
23:22:19 <Camail> i cringe when i see all the backer OCs in the stages, but i can ignore them
23:22:52 <Dot`> thier OC's? that makes sense :/ but now they are ruined
23:22:59 <Dot`> i didnt even think about it
23:23:04 <Dot`> i was happy!
23:23:12 <Dot`> why you do this cam
23:23:19 <Camail> lul
23:23:54 <Bio> so many OCs
23:23:54 <Camail> ignorance is poison, living sad lives is better than false ones
23:24:13 <Camail> they are all OCs and they are gonna stay OCs
23:24:25 <Phearlock> Aw, I think the background chars are nice
