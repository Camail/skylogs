14:24:16 <Cane> https://www.twitch.tv/quake 1v1 duel tourney today. Shouldn't go too long.
14:24:28 <Cane> Probably won't be as interesting as 2v2 but there should be some good gameplay.
14:40:49 <Dot`_> Hey cane <3
14:50:18 <Cane> I made steak, salad, and fries. 
14:50:21 <Cane> I'd invite you all, but it's mine.

14:51:38 <Zounds> I'm nightshift 19:00 - 07:00 from tuesday to friday next week
14:51:52 <Zounds> gonna be a slow start to the WoW expac for me
14:52:26 <Zounds> I don't care much for the initial rush anyway so I'm not bothered much
14:52:53 <Zounds> I missed the current expac launch by a week and a bit and it was just fine :D
15:06:50 <skram> ach
15:06:57 <skram> 12 hour shifts are the worst zounds
15:12:51 <Zounds> They do make regular 8 hour shifts seem to pass in the blink of an eye though
15:12:56 <Zounds> ^^
15:13:21 <Cane> BioSC, still good https://clips.twitch.tv/BrightFragileOryxKappa
15:13:41 <skram> do you have stuff to do at least zounds
15:15:32 <Zounds> Mostly just patrols, I'm guarding equipment that is being dismantled
15:16:02 <Zounds> Gotta ward off any sneaky buggers who wanna mess with it during the night since it's in a public park
15:16:45 <Dot`_> will you get to shout at ppl with a thick scottish accent?
15:17:33 <Zounds> If I have to I suppose
15:17:58 <skram> do you have a truncheon
15:18:25 <Zounds> Nah
15:18:59 <Zounds> Only thing I have is a license that lets me put hands on with reasonable force without being charged with assault
15:19:33 <skram> so stern words and loving embraces
15:20:18 <Zounds> aye
15:20:43 -!- tredc [~tredc@c83-251-163-99.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
15:20:59 <skram> so if im feelin lonely ill just break into your park
15:21:45 <Zounds> reasonable force can be quite varied
15:22:13 <Zounds> I had a colleague who had to incapacitate a drunk giant guy who was swinging at him by hitting him with a fire extinguisher
15:22:28 <Zounds> he wasn't punished for that
15:22:39 <skram> yeah and you wouldnt do that to someone doing a piss behind a park bench or something
15:22:51 <Zounds> No ofc :P
15:22:54 <skram> or it probably wouldnt be reasonable :p
15:23:34 <Zounds> Really we just have the same powers as almost anybody else, we're not police
15:23:45 <Zounds> We just might be more likely to use our powers of citizen arrest or something

18:31:23 <Cane> There have been some hype games today though.
18:31:26 <Cane> How you doing Camail?
18:31:43 <Camail> doing well, started playing Tyranny, finally
18:31:48 <Camail> got it free on twitch awhile ago
18:32:12 <Camail> it's much more different than i expected
18:32:24 <Cane> Oh yeah, that Obsidian game I forgot existed. Hmm.
18:32:39 <Cane> I think there was a reason I skipped it, but I no longer remember what that reason was.
18:32:49 <Cane> It's probably a solid game.
18:47:44 <Bio> asdf
18:58:34 <Camail> it's been really fun so far, the spell crafting is pretty interesting

19:50:45 <Cane> ggs
20:06:45 <Camail> tho it's really getting annoying that every fight has 2-3 ranged enemies targeting my healer the entire time
20:06:54 <Camail> it makes sense, it just isn't very fun
20:07:06 <Camail> never had that problem in either poe game
20:53:46 <Phearlock_> Hm, trying to remember if I even had a dedicated healer in tyranny
20:58:51 <Phearlock_> yeah I did. but I also had a lot of supportive abilities across the party which was neat.
20:59:02 <Phearlock_> Everyone had access to the small heal
21:00:14 <Phearlock_> Magic system was really neat in that game
21:00:30 <Phearlock_> Everyone could get access to some of the basic stuff with minimal investment
21:50:17 <Dot`> skram
21:51:23 <skram> yeah buddy?
