20:11:13 <Dot> pear pon <3
20:11:25 <skram> Dot is tarkov any good
20:11:30 <skram> ferlok old boy
20:11:40 <Phearlock> I am getting old yes
20:12:13 <Dot> i would say the best FPS i have played in a long time, but I like ARMA
20:13:07 <skram> does it have awkward inventory managment too
20:13:51 <Dot> actually... no, you can even rotate items 
20:15:37 <Phearlock> Not played it much but from looking at it, it seems complex but fairly streamlined?
20:15:48 <Phearlock> not played it at all*
20:18:31 <Dot> its very detailed
20:18:52 <skram> looks kinda polished too
20:18:57 <skram> arma felt kinda janky to me
20:19:15 <Dot> arma movement is very janky
20:19:20 <Dot> 2 is far worse than 3 for that
20:19:43 <Dot> but you get use to it, and it becomes very intuative 
20:20:14 <Dot> but so far in my experience Tarkov keeps the good parts of arma movement and does away with the jankyness
20:21:13 <Dot> i am very impressed with the game, its got more in it than most AAA titles, but its expensive for a beta
20:22:11 <Dot> and it does still have really bad flaws occur, like visors would show as lowered but not be and there was  no way to tell when going in of your visor was on
20:22:29 <skram> what sort of game modes are in it
20:25:10 <Dot> currently just raids, there are 5 maps currently, you spawn in have a bunch of extraction points you can go to
20:25:18 <Dot> then its a mix of PvP, PvE and looting
20:25:28 <Dot> various amounts depends on the map
20:26:01 <Dot> quests for xp and stuff
20:26:57 <Camail> i'm still waiting for the fpsmmo
20:27:10 <Camail> tabula rasa tried, and it was fun
20:27:34 <Camail> and no destiny doesnt count
20:27:35 <Dot> the end goal of tarkov is to be open like stalker is
20:27:52 <Camail> OK BUT I JUST WANT MORE STALKER

20:28:00 <Dot> EXACTLY CAM
20:28:06 <Camail> i just want SoC again
20:28:08 <Camail> give me a remaster
20:28:17 <Dot> there is STALKER 2 announced
20:28:25 <Camail> give me a fun way to find artifactsa nd a fun way to use them
20:28:28 <Camail> and a fun way to sell them
20:28:47 <Zounds> oh somebody else who played tabular rasa
20:28:50 <Camail> just let me be a scavanger, make that the game
20:28:50 <Zounds> tabula*
20:28:55 <Zounds> that game was pretty good
20:28:57 <Dot> phear! i like this one https://greyartpost.tumblr.com/image/179832134484

21:25:23 <Dot`> sounds like a dorf fort bug
21:27:55 <Camail_> if giving birth had no energy cost then people in the lower castes would be having tons of babies
