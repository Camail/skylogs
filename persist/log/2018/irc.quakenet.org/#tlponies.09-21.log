20:58:43 <Camail> thats a yes
20:58:46 <Cane> lol
20:59:30 <Camail> when you dont think you need to juke
20:59:33 <Camail> and get rekt
21:02:37 <Cane> The pure burst damage in that clip reminded me of https://clips.twitch.tv/CarelessRoundCockroachVoteNay
21:04:41 <Cane> Rapha is streaming btw.
21:06:46 <Camail> they havent done any 2v2s in awhile
21:06:56 <Camail> must be a duel tourny soon
21:07:05 <Camail> boy is this format boring
21:07:25 <Cane> zzz
21:07:33 <Cane> The next tournament is duel only.
21:07:40 <Cane> I think next 2v2 tourney is DHW?
21:07:50 <Cane> They said they'll do a lot more 2v2 grind leaning up to that.
21:08:01 <Camail> yea makes sense
21:08:10 <Camail> i just dont get what TOs see in duels
21:08:25 <Camail> or if its the devs
21:09:07 <Camail> in 2v2 the abilities are in service of the fundamentals of quake, you use them for item advantage and positional advantage
21:09:14 <Camail> in duels you just use them to get a kill

21:09:28 <Camail> because kills are just so much more important than anything else
21:10:28 <Cane> I've developed Stockholm syndrome a little over the past couple of weeks, just because there's nothing else Quake wise to watch.
21:10:37 <Cane> So duel got a bit better, but it's still deeply flawed.
21:11:15 <Cane> I hate how getting creative and flashy in duel is how you start losing. Stay safe, stay boring, pick away at your enemy for like 2 minutes straight, run around the map...
21:11:19 <Cane> That's how you win duels.
21:11:29 <Cane> Run around until you have ability then go for some kind of play.
21:11:34 <Camail> yea duels going to time make me change channels
21:11:41 <Cane> Mmhmm.
21:11:54 <Camail> i've never finished watching a set that went to time
21:11:58 <Cane> Been watching DaHanG the past few days 'cause he's finally been streaming again.
21:12:01 <Cane> He always complains about it.
21:12:02 <Camail> there are still cool moments tho
21:12:20 <Cane> He'll die by doing a push or something, he goes "I tried to get too flashy and fancy. Sigh. Time to just play boring again."
21:12:28 <Cane> And with anyone else you'd just go "Yeah yeah excuses"
21:12:35 <Cane> But then he plays boring and safe and FUCKING MURDERS EVERYONE and nobody has a chance.
21:12:43 <Cane> So players are just fighting their own boredom threshold.
21:13:18 <Camail> yea when you've won every duel tourny you can have an opinion
21:13:24 <Cane> Pretty much.
21:13:53 <Camail> because he knows what the best play is but he doesn't want to do it anymore
21:14:14 <Camail> the lack of freedom has made the game stagnate before it's even out
21:14:48 <Cane> And they need to remove Blood Run from the pool. That's the biggest run-away-and-pick-away-slowly map of the lot.
21:15:30 <Cane> But yeah, like I said, slight Stockholm syndrome right now because everyone is grinding duel and I like watching Quake.
21:15:31 <Camail> more maps without rail pls

21:46:38 <Crisium> ahoy
21:51:52 <Bio> cane did u watch the vod
21:51:54 <Bio> of me
21:51:58 <Bio> i saved it
21:52:16 <Cane> I bookmarked it, gonna watch it tonight or tomorrow when I'm done with programming.
21:52:24 <Cane> It was a little bit too interesting to just be background noise.
21:52:42 <Bio> noice
21:52:46 <Bio> what u workin on
21:53:06 <Cane> Camail, 2v2 PUGs happening.
21:53:15 <Camail> woo
21:53:21 <Cane> rapha+GniK vs dramiS+nosfa.
21:53:49 <Cane> From what I can tell nosfa is a really good Brazilian player, solid aimer/fragger but without the game sense of the high tier players.

22:12:53 <Camail> his dodging is the most obviously flawed part of his game
22:13:11 <Camail> puts himself in trapped situations often

22:44:07 <Dot`> Skram
22:44:26 <skram> how you bean
22:46:55 <DuB`> lolol new molten core is basically splatoon
22:47:08 <DuB`> But with LAVA
22:47:12 <Dot`> good skram, playing tarkov and loosing all my gear atm
22:48:41 <skram> make tj carry you

23:06:30 <Crisium> new torb is kinda fun
23:06:36 <Crisium> pharah buffs are actually wild tho
23:12:58 <Dot`> how are you skram
23:25:11 <Cane> How's new Torb? I haven't looked at changes.
23:28:55 <Cane> Camail, rapha+dooi now and I think that might be unfair.
23:29:29 <Camail> its no TL but yea that's gonna be fun to fight
23:32:03 <DuB`> Torb changes are all good and make him more enjoyable
23:32:07 <DuB`> Dunno about his ult tho
23:32:21 <DuB`> I like it but it seems too easy to just... not walk in the puddles of lava
23:38:15 <DuB`> https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1043266453263151104
23:40:42 <Cane> Holy crap what a scramble from rapha+dooi to bring it back.
23:42:14 <DuB`> queke!
23:45:08 <Camail> dub the clearest examples i could see would be area denial, so around corners, behind the payload, maaaaybe somewhere on a cp, but that one seems bad
23:50:56 <DuB`> Was doing some custom games
23:51:14 <DuB`> You can just jump on someone and unload it all for a pretty guaranteed kill
23:51:24 <DuB`> Otherwise only useful in very tight chokes or small rooms 
23:52:04 <DuB`> Hard to even cover a whole control point, but it'd still disrupt a fight at least
23:55:55 <Crisium> torb + hammond ult gonna be so annoying
23:56:05 <DuB`> Haha
23:56:12 <Crisium> been playing a lot on the PTR, im not convinced the turret isnt worse.  but torb himself is much better
23:56:29 <Crisium> the 10 second cooldown to build a turret after it is destroyed really hurts
23:56:57 <Camail> i've always felt it weird for overwatch to have an engineer class, so making it more player dependent makes sense to me
