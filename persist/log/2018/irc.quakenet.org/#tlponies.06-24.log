17:57:38 <DuB`> ES2 is quite nice
17:58:01 <DuB`> I have gotten very frustrated with the map in my game, but I know there are lots of settings you can tweak for that
17:58:24 <Phearlock> yeah endless space 2 was good fun
17:59:40 <DuB`> I started in a little corner pocket of the galaxy with no midgame resources and a single-path bottleneck 3 systems long all held by a guy who didn't like me
17:59:47 <DuB`> ... as a pacifict empire

18:00:49 <Phearlock> I wouldn't call any empire in endless space 2 actually pacifist
18:00:58 <DuB`> Couldn't do nuffin about it and couldn't make him mad enough to start a war himself :P
18:01:02 <DuB`> And boy did I try
18:01:34 <Phearlock> Though yeah not being able to delcare war is ugh
18:01:39 <DuB`> Well 90% of my pop is the pacifist group and I didn't really wanna go declare war and try to raze 3-4 whole systems outta nowhere
18:02:11 <Phearlock> Conquer! Kill!
18:02:20 <DuB`> And THEN
18:02:39 <Phearlock> I like the plants, they're so damn happy
18:02:46 <DuB`> Another nearby guy who I don't mind invited me to alliance because they needed help defending againset some other rude guys
18:02:49 <Phearlock> Can just start expanding like crazy after a certain point.
18:02:54 <DuB`> Which was cool, saved his butt
18:03:12 <DuB`> BUT then he invited the guy who _I_ hated to the alliance and now I REALLY can't do anything to him! :P
18:03:24 <Phearlock> D=
18:03:59 <DuB`> I have enough influence pressure on him that I might just be able to start demanding planets though lol
18:04:16 <Phearlock> =D
18:05:59 <DuB`> I do think I like the combat a bit more than stellaris

18:06:18 <Phearlock> yeah
18:06:19 <DuB`> There's just a BIT more to it than the "my blob of ships has a higher number on it so I win"
18:06:22 <DuB`> A bit
18:06:46 <Phearlock> Stellaris is a bit deeper than what you describe, but yeah I like ES2's combat more
18:07:05 <DuB`> So if I can just figure out how to get the map more to my liking I think I'll like ES2 more overall
