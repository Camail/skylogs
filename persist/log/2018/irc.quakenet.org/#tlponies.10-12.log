00:23:07 <reification> yes cam that was an odd daily
00:23:23 <reification> curse power and huge money meant it was pretty easy tho
00:23:36 <Camail> but fun, sadly i could never add enough block/buffers to get perfects
00:23:46 <Camail> only got a handful
00:24:09 <Camail> dailies are a lot less about winning and a lot more about winning better than other people
00:24:25 <Camail> but the idea of knowing your draws and never reshuffling was cool
00:24:33 <reification> gotta be the winningest
00:24:47 <Camail> i almost wish the curse modifier wasn't in there so you could do highlander
00:24:59 <reification> had to get used to not caring about putting crap in the discard pile
00:25:07 <Camail> its basically impossible with that
00:25:46 <Camail> yea ruining the discard pile was a fun realization to have
00:44:27 <reification> night all
01:29:11 <Camail> nn
01:29:20 <Camail> from beyond the grave
