21:39:35 <Zounds> play torb
21:51:34 <DuB`> Was having an annoying bug when I was playing last weekend
21:51:52 <DuB`> The ally/enemy team colors I'd set kept swapping
21:52:08 <DuB`> Settings looked the same when I checked but enemies were blue!
21:57:54 <carcinization> that's extra challenge mode dub
22:04:05 <DuB`> It's "Is that fuzzy blob over there an enemy or part of the wall?" mode!
22:27:29 <Camail> we could diablo later
22:27:49 <Camail> before the season ends i do want to get a real 3 man comp and at least try to see how far we get
