02:11:31 <Phearlock> Huh
02:11:39 <Phearlock> I did not use it
02:11:43 <Phearlock> So I guess I didn't know
02:11:44 <Phearlock> =D
02:12:10 <Camail> that + a redesign to the highest 2 difficulties
02:12:21 <Phearlock> nice
02:12:23 <Camail> well, those are coming later
02:12:32 <Camail> but the bug that prevented upwards level scaling is gone
02:14:03 <Camail> I'm worried many of the complaints about difficulty were because of the lack of level scaling, and that they will over compensate

12:22:30 <Cane> So I went looking through my library to find a fun little game to play as a time killer and booted up Shovel Knight again, but I didn't get very far into it before I stopped. I've played it too much I think. Any suggestions for games?
12:23:21 <Phearlock> Fighting herds =P
12:23:33 <Phearlock> I promised camail I'd bully more pons into playing it

12:30:24 <Zounds> it doesn't have much of a story or anything but the gameplay is good fun
12:35:11 <Dot> hollow knight is a cute little easy game

12:35:19 <Phearlock> haha
12:35:23 <Phearlock> good though

14:58:20 <skram> Tell me about it Cane
14:58:32 <skram> did ricciardo win
14:58:54 <Cane> No overtakes in the top 4 at all. Ricciardo killed it, no one could touch him. Vettel in 2nd was equally consistent but never really managed to challenge.
14:59:03 <Cane> Verstappen started in 20th place? Ended up 9th iirc.
14:59:18 <skram> oh danhg
14:59:32 <skram> so like 11 overtakes on monaco
14:59:55 <skram> or were there a lot of DNFs :p
15:00:07 <Cane> Only one DNF. Verstappen is just a madman.
15:01:09 <skram> definitly
15:01:15 <Zounds> hullo Crisium and skram
15:01:20 <Cane> Oh wait, 3 DNFs, but by then Verstappen had already passed them.
15:01:21 <skram> zounds pal
15:01:25 <Crisium> hallo
15:05:55 <skram> So there's Montreal in 2 weeks Cane, and LeMans the weekend after

18:54:49 <Phearlock> I am not srkam but, what is your ac again?
18:55:01 <Dot> currently 17
18:55:08 <Dot> im leaning to AC
18:55:19 <Dot> AC is pretty static so any increase is good
18:55:38 <Phearlock> yeah also leaning to ac
19:01:13 <Phearlock> I'm sure 18 ac hits more breakpoints than +2 damage
19:09:25 <Zounds> So much mechstuff today
19:09:34 <Zounds> I could feel my mind beginning to wander there towards the end
19:09:36 <Zounds> great fun though

19:13:10 <Zounds> Not settled on anything yet ofc
19:13:32 <Phearlock> Quickdraw is really popular for twin MRM 30 boating as well.
19:13:51 <Phearlock> pretty high mounts
19:14:30 <skram> Dot is it +2 damage only or is it +2 to attack rolls too
19:14:41 <Zounds> yeah I'll do a bit of research before I get anything
19:14:55 <Dot> only damage skram
19:15:16 <skram> I'd get the AC bonus
