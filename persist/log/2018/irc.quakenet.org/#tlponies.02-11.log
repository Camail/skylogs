06:45:18 <Camail> fgh
06:45:26 <Camail> ok, everything is fixed
06:45:28 <Camail> forever
06:45:36 <Camail> and nothing will ever go wrong again
06:45:43 <DuB`> ;D
06:46:34 <Camail> the best part of writing code is closing all the tabs after
06:46:43 <Camail> its like putting down a heavy backpack
06:47:22 <Camail> .tell dot` this devil child has been purified
06:48:23 <Camail> there was a problem i could fix that would end up with me deleting a little bit of functionality, but i didn't want to do that
06:48:47 <Camail> also i got rid of tellm, i thought that was the problem early on, I might put it back in or not
06:49:03 <Camail> it was rather sloppy
07:12:05 <Cane> The best part of writing code is when you redo the section you just did because you can't figure out why the fuck it isn't working, and then the next code breaks something else, and oh wait did I say best I meant worst
07:12:17 <Cane> And now I have an actual headache.
07:12:21 <Cane> Break time.
07:37:07 <Cane> Man, I need to play The Ur-Quan Masters again.
07:37:16 <Cane> I'll stream the hell out of it when I get to it.
07:37:20 <Camail> so cane, the .seen command is gone
07:37:25 <Camail> because it literally killed the db
07:37:32 <Cane> Oh wow, that's impressive.
07:37:40 <Camail> it wrote so many times for so many years that it single handedly corrupted the database
07:37:50 <Camail> every line, forever, a new commit
07:38:00 <Cane> That's kind of fascinating.
07:39:14 <Cane> How much of the bot have you written or rewritten? I actually don't know if it's one you made or a lightly modified standard model or anything in between.
07:39:32 <Camail> I've patched a lot of little stuff
07:39:51 <Camail> i wrote the twitch plugin, i modified the youtube one to accept the latest api
07:40:01 <Camail> had to change .tell a few times
07:40:15 <Camail> honestly, anything we use frequently other than .r I've messed it
07:41:23 <Camail> I've always kind of wanted to write my own because it's kinda shitty, but nothing has given me a big enough problem
07:43:00 <Cane> For the Twitch plugin, do you have any idea why it's so delayed in updating? I can start the stream, but several minutes later I post the link here and Sweetie sees it as offline. Is the API really that delayed?

08:02:27 <Camail_Phone> Internet died, fun
08:03:22 <Camail_Phone> To answer your question, i believe the api updates for offline channels at a much lower frequency

08:03:38 -!- mode/#tlponies [+v Camail_] by Q
08:03:45 <Camail_> cool, back
08:04:26 <Camail_> so yea all I'm doing is calling the api, there's nothing i can do to make the channel status change faster
08:05:29 <Camail_> it must be an optimization thing, for the sheer volume of offline channels, they must do the updates in batches
08:06:05 <Cane> Thought so, figured I'd ask.
08:08:14 <Camail> if someone really wanted instant status I bet they could write something that just directly looks at the streamer's channel and see if the page wants to load a media player
08:08:33 <Camail> its super not an issue because if you're linking your own stream obviously its live
08:08:53 <Camail> but if that became an issue for something, skipping the api entirely would be a fun little hack
08:53:11 <Bio> fak
08:53:18 <Bio> that was a long work
