21:30:42 <Bio> asdf
21:35:25 <Dot`> how you feel bio
21:38:26 <Bio> I'm gud
21:38:34 <Bio> i know how to better prepare now
21:38:46 <Bio> felt like the split part of the game went well
21:38:52 <Phearlock> Was pretty smooth as far as first sessions go
21:38:59 <Dot`> yea, you get to know how to put things together pretty quick
21:39:24 <Bio> this module kinda throws you into the shit real quick
21:40:01 <Dot`> yea, looks rough, at least LMOP is desighned to be a intro for GMing as well
21:40:08 <Dot`> but its going well
21:42:55 <Runbunny> Going to bed before midnight!
21:43:08 <Dot`> madness
21:45:30 <Dot`> "but we arnt going to play like 5 hours, its going to be a short dnd session" - Bio 2018
21:45:40 <Bio> yeah
21:45:52 <Bio> i shoulda just had you guys get to the keep then stop
21:46:08 <Bio> and it was only 4.5
21:46:09 <Bio> !~
21:46:12 <Dot`> haha
21:46:22 <Bio> technically correct is the best kind
21:46:28 <Dot`> i normaly got a headache if i DMed longer than 4 hours
21:47:03 <Dot`> keeping a break at the 2 hour mark is very important for DM
21:47:31 <Dot`> screw the players
21:47:37 <Bio> haha

21:51:30 <Zounds> cam
21:51:31 <skram> well the player introduction took almost 3 hours :P
21:53:42 <DuB`> Funtimes
21:54:21 <Bio> fun times
21:54:27 <Bio> time to find some leftover pizza
21:55:38 <Dot`> hey cam
21:56:45 <Dot`> Dub, i tihnk i should give my rapier and shield to you and you can frontline a bit
21:56:50 <Dot`> i can use a bow just fine
21:57:04 <DuB`> :O
21:57:16 <DuB`> What if I want to NOT take any damage ever! :P
21:57:36 <Dot`> well then we TPK
21:57:41 <DuB`> Aw
21:58:21 <Phearlock> Should have rolled a wazzard if you wanted to have an excuse to stay away from the damages.
21:59:01 <Dot`> dont worry dub, once your hurt we shove the wizard in there
21:59:18 <Phearlock> D=
21:59:19 <Dot`> and he can demonstrate the dodge action
21:59:20 <DuB`> Maybe I need the dual-wielding +1 to AC feat for this party
22:02:57 <Phearlock> Dot should end up as a pretty good tank
22:03:03 <Phearlock> But end up =/= lvl 
22:03:04 <Phearlock> 1
22:04:09 <Dot`> eh, dex fighter i should get to like 19 with no magic
22:04:40 <Dot`> Our meat sponge will probably be even better
22:12:58 <skram> Ya barbarians arent good tanks :p
22:13:05 <Dot`> they the best
22:13:19 <Dot`> its what thy do
22:14:03 <skram> despite having simple damage resistance they have no AC
22:15:54 <Dot`> well yoh have 14 AC, i have  17, thast 3 less, on a 20 thats 15% less only
22:16:10 <Dot`> and the gap is even less than that becuase modifiers
22:16:13 <skram> 15% is a big deal though
22:16:19 <Dot`> and you only take 50% damage
22:16:21 <skram> besides, you can heal yourself
22:16:28 <Dot`> i can heal all the peasants
22:16:47 <Dot`> barbarians are super tough
