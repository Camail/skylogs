18:38:10 <Camail> another day
18:38:12 <Camail> another draw
18:38:25 <Camail> this years chess is...frustrating
18:40:14 <Dot> haha
18:41:07 <reification> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GSfqcVSb-8
18:41:08 <Dot> i thought at first carlson was happy to just draw games out long knowing he has far more experience to cope
18:41:29 <Dot> but then game 3 and 4 where quick
18:48:57 <Camail> i think he took game 1 long on purpose to feel out the dynamic between them, but now he's fine accepting draws
18:49:08 <Camail> the're both very good, and very young
18:49:23 <Camail> i doubt stamina will come into play
18:50:24 <Camail> i think carlsen is better at faster chess, so if it comes down to game 13 then he'll win
18:50:37 <Dot> that too
18:50:55 <Camail> it's awlays caruana that goes down to the last minutes before 40
18:51:29 <Camail> this game only hit 30 and carlsen was up 8 minutes
18:52:17 <Camail> that also might be a tactic, always keep caruana on the play? i don't know much about him so i dunno
