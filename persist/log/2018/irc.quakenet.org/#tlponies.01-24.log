13:45:03 <Zounds> Then I played Perfect Dark: Zero on the Xbox360 and hated everything
13:45:49 <Zounds> My waifu Joanna dark suddenly was an american with tattoos
13:45:56 <Dot`> oh dear
13:46:25 <Zounds> and they put the scottish guy in a kilt because it was strange that he was scottish and it was not his main characteristic
13:46:26 <reification> unforgivable
13:46:48 <skram> hahahah
13:47:04 <Zounds> Tested poorly with the 10-11 year old USA child demographic probably
