00:12:08 <CockRoach|42> pls
00:17:03 <Crisium> literally best team vs worst team now in WL
00:17:07 <Crisium> lets go dragons!
00:17:59 <DuB`> DRAGOOONS
00:23:50 <Dot`> thanks for stream cane
00:24:03 <Dot`> too bad it turned frstrating
00:27:22 <Cane> Yeah, the game had me until it gated all the content.
00:27:40 <Cane> Now what else do I stream?
00:27:45 <Cane> I feel like I need a successful game today.
00:28:46 <Dot`> that rogueliek you streamed ages ago... i forget its name, its really old
00:29:01 <Dot`> nethack
00:29:37 <Cane> NetHack is fun yeah.
00:32:32 <Dot`> slay the spire is a rogue-like tha Bio is enjoying
00:32:52 <Cane> Slay the Spire?
00:33:13 <Cane> Oh, early access, no wonder I didn't look at it.
00:33:23 <Dot`> ah, didn know it was early access still
00:35:30 <Bio> i think you'd like it
00:35:40 <Bio> its pretty young in its EA life
00:35:51 <Bio> its like a rouge like card game
00:37:29 <Dot`> i havnt really played any memrable roguelikes recently
00:38:17 <Cane> I know... I was hoping Delver would scratch that itch for a while.
00:38:21 <Cane> And then bamf, crashes.
00:38:35 <DuB`> :(
00:40:37 <Dot`> well, when you get around to trying Duskers, i hope it is good
00:43:53 <Cane> Duskers does seem neat, though I think it'll require more of my brain power than would make for a successful stream.
00:44:21 <Dot`> i dont think its the kind of game you want to try after 2 faluires
00:44:21 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
00:44:32 <Dot`> you want sometihn goyu know and is good
00:48:45 <Bio> had some tasty fish tonight
00:48:47 <Bio> yum
00:48:55 <DuB`> What sort of fish?
00:49:02 <Bio> cat
00:49:22 <DuB`> mmmeh
00:51:26 <Bio> ok mr judgey pants =D
00:52:55 <DuB`> Naw, I probably just don't like freshwater fish because I've never had good stuff
00:53:15 <DuB`> Had some bleh something ages ago and haven't tried since
00:53:16 <Bio> these were nice cuts
00:57:39 <Crisium> Pine too good 
01:05:12 <Cane> I may have to try Scavenger SV-4 at some point.
01:06:01 <Dot`> that game does look intresting
01:07:04 <Crisium> https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/959229939898761216
01:07:30 <Camail> DuB`  dice game with word parts
01:07:32 <Camail> r u rdy
01:08:16 <Dot`> Daaags
01:08:33 <DuB`> Yes
01:09:14 <DuB`> Hmm, same newyear skins as last time probably? Won't have to worry about getting any I think
01:10:28 <Crisium> i assume they will add some new ones
01:11:08 <DuB`> 3k for event legendaries is sooo much since they changed the lootbox rng
01:11:12 <DuB`> Too hard to get the coins
01:18:12 <DuB`> Dragons!
01:21:35 <Cane> I want a dungeon crawler game. Delver isn't gonna work due to crashes, but I want to enter a cavern or dungeon, slay monsters, collect loot, find treasure, equip character.
01:21:38 <Cane> Recommendations?
01:22:14 <skrma> darkest dungeon? :D
01:23:06 <Bio> dank
01:23:26 <Cane> Have Darkest Dungeon, never got into it much.
01:26:08 <reification> night all
01:26:42 <Cane> Later reif. <3
01:26:53 <Dot`> gnight
01:31:44 <Dot`> cane, peopl ereally seem to like Tales of Maj'Eyal
01:31:54 <Dot`> never heard of it myself
01:33:05 <Cane> Oh yeah, I've played ToME. It's good for what it is, but I'm all ToME'd out.
01:45:55 <Crisium> welp so much for dragon hype
01:46:02 <DuB`> :(
02:13:54 <Camail> cane maybe take a look at Slay the Spire, its a deck builder so it kinda has all those elements baked into it
02:16:01 <DuB`> Ana!
02:19:29 <Crisium> just on first point sadly
02:28:45 <DuB`> 98.2%

04:26:25 <Camail> i almost want to get it for ps4 so i can play it at my brother's place
04:59:54 <Micen|Droid> I thought this episode was winding down
05:01:48 <DuB`> Camail: All of the streamers I follow who picked up HAPPEN to be playing with hammer and it's awful
05:02:19 <DuB`> Like, so many of the weapons are pretty cool but they all picked the slowest dullest one by coincidence lol
05:02:43 <Camail> gun lance looks so fucking sick
05:02:58 <Camail> explosions all over
05:03:00 <DuB`> Yeah!
05:03:18 <DuB`> And the glaive spear thing has the detachable minion and all sorts of crazy movement things
05:03:24 <Camail> I have been avoiding streams because i want to let it be fresh when i get it....in 8 months
05:03:28 <Camail> sigh
05:03:31 <DuB`> :P
05:03:46 <Camail> switch axe also looks cool
05:03:51 <Camail> yea everything is cool other than the hammer
05:03:54 <DuB`> srs!
05:03:57 <Camail> which is fun, but not over the top
05:04:08 <Camail> people like the blunt damage to the head
05:04:13 <Camail> the stun mechanic is cool
05:04:15 <Camail> but its just a hammer
05:04:30 <Camail> also a lot of these people are new and the hammer is easy to learn

18:17:32 <Dot`> should always make 2 pizzas
18:17:55 <DuB`> And then share with me!
18:18:16 <skram> the rule is that you make 25% more than you eat so you have seconds
