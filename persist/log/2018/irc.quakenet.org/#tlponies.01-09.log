00:00:01 <Phearlock> If you want to REALLY lose all your free time building stuff, From the Depths is still a thing.
00:00:04 <Runbunny> Seen*
00:00:14 <Phearlock> Which is a fuckton more complex
00:00:21 <Runbunny> I don't know why I skipped a word. maybe I don't have time :/
00:01:55 <Phearlock> I built 3 ships in avorion, only have screenies of the last one easily accessible though. https://imgur.com/4oqzZ7k , https://imgur.com/qiKVvZ0
00:02:08 <Phearlock> Took me um, 6 hours?
00:02:43 <Runbunny> But phearlock... Those look like spaceships...
00:03:09 <Phearlock> On the bright side the actual mechanics and physics in avorion are very simple.
00:03:18 <Phearlock> Cosmetics take time, internals do not
00:03:40 <Runbunny> Avorion is clearly for building bright casino signs you can fly around in.
00:03:55 <Phearlock> From the depths is more like, you have to design the engine and weapons, drive systems, defenses yourself.
00:04:21 <DuB`> I played a few hours of Avorion demo and what I built did NOT look that good. :P
00:04:25 <Phearlock> Then make it all fit inside a pretty looking package.
00:04:45 <Phearlock> That's why it took hours dub
00:06:08 <Phearlock> Also again, this was the third of 3 ships that I made with the intention of looking pretty.
00:06:27 <Phearlock> So I had a bit of experience with how to put the blocks to make the shapes I needed etc

00:06:34 <Phearlock> First two didn't look as good
00:22:43 <Runbunny> I should replay freelancer.
00:23:01 <Phearlock> that was a fun game
00:23:02 <Runbunny> I kinda have my space sim fighter mood on atm.
00:23:09 <Runbunny> it was.
00:23:22 <Phearlock> Did you play Diaspora: Shattered Armistice?
00:24:09 <Runbunny> I played online with some random guy I found on a server
00:24:12 <Runbunny> I have not.
00:24:20 <Phearlock> If you want a free, short, super atmospheric space fighter game, that one is excellent.
00:24:30 <Dot`> i love freelancer, one day in the year 3077 Star citizen will be done
00:24:34 <Dot`> and it will be glorious
00:24:37 <Phearlock> It's a battlestar galactica campaign made using the freespace 2 engine.
00:25:00 <Phearlock> Not too long, quite hard, super well made.
00:41:37 <Crisium> 2-2, net loss of 3 SR Skram
00:41:42 <Crisium> even going even is a losing battle
00:41:46 <Crisium> and i had a thrower
00:42:27 <skram> its great playing dva
00:42:34 <skram> means i do all the damage
00:43:14 <Crisium> theres no hope
00:43:29 <Crisium> guy picks someone he has 41 mins of experience with COMBINED SEASONS
00:43:36 <Crisium> then leaves the game
00:43:48 <Crisium> lost 25 SR
00:43:56 <Crisium> i have never gained 25SR in the new system, ever
00:44:00 <Crisium> its a joke

02:00:03 <skram> by what metric
02:00:05 <skram> p l s
02:02:23 <Bio> all the ones that matter
02:02:26 <Dot`> most stable geniuses
02:02:34 <Bio> *eagle cries in the distance*
02:02:42 <DuB`> Most capita per guns
02:02:48 <Dot`> pffff
02:02:58 <Dot`> africa beats that dub
02:03:06 <skram> wikipedia says 101 guns per 100 persons
02:03:09 <Dot`> and most of middle east
02:03:57 <Dot`> maybe per capita recorded guns
02:06:36 <Dot`> though i really didnt think it was that high in america
02:06:39 <Dot`> thats insane
02:13:55 <Camail> pls
02:14:25 <Dot`> cam, your country has a problem
02:14:34 <Camail> every country has problems
02:14:57 <Dot`> changes nothing
02:15:38 <Camail> the embarrassment is fleeting, it concerns me FAR less than the policy changes
02:16:27 <Camail> the policy is changing as if there was no president, which there basically isn't
02:17:12 <Dot`> oprah next president
02:17:53 <skram> why not zoidberg
02:21:47 <Camail> dub wanna go undergorund?
02:30:38 <DuB`> Gonna head to gym soon
02:32:25 <Crisium> why not zoidberg
02:35:12 <skram> this is a terrible run
02:35:19 <skram> very entertaining though :p
02:36:37 <Phearlock> yes haha
02:38:44 <Dot`> does the ladder end?
02:42:56 <Camail> fuck, i can't solo challenging
02:43:26 <Camail> I almost did it the second time but I couldn't deal with all the fucking AI running away and hiding
02:44:52 <Camail> the DPS isn't even the issue, it's keeping everyone in front of me and actually having direct fights
02:49:55 <Camail> also, agdq 2018 is like ~30k under last year so far
02:50:06 <Camail> looks like we've found the plateau
02:50:08 <Crisium> god, rage quitting smurfs who dont care cause its their smurf
02:50:09 <Crisium> fak off
02:52:01 <skram> cris wanna stak
02:57:30 <Dot`> skrm, hows sneak game going?
02:59:50 <skram> i dont understand any of the lore
02:59:53 <skram> at all
03:00:16 <Crisium> im in my last game
03:00:17 <Crisium> then i go sleep
03:00:17 <DuB`> snek game?
03:00:24 <skram> ya
03:00:36 <skram> its so weird dot
03:01:05 <skram> its like super srs sneaky beaky game and then like demons and hivemind zombies and mechas
03:01:17 <Dot`> lol
03:01:30 <Dot`> i didnt knw those where in it
03:01:59 <skram> its pretty great
03:02:16 <skram> but im quite certain someone is fucking with me
03:02:17 <skram> :p
03:03:57 <Dot`> haha
03:04:49 <Phearlock> Eeyyy managed to get to the end of Everspace
03:05:16 <Phearlock> Still tons to do though, more runs needed
03:05:39 <Crisium> god i hate my teammates
03:05:44 <Crisium> so much
03:05:51 <Crisium> disgusting play
03:06:07 <Crisium> statiscially im outperforming my healing partner, does not matter
03:06:25 <Crisium> for example, mercy outheals moira on every rank.  im outhealing the mercy
03:06:27 <Crisium> does not matter
03:06:48 <Crisium> just ONE example of statistically i am better
03:06:49 <Crisium> but i lose
03:07:27 <Crisium> individual skill, as a  measurable metric, is almost entirely irrelvant compared to the metric of r n fucking g
03:07:33 <Crisium> ALMOST
03:07:36 <Crisium> unless you are dps god
03:08:20 <Crisium> gained 39 SR for the night though
03:08:27 <Crisium> only 2 rage quitters which 100% guarenteed a loss
03:08:29 <skram> how many games did you play cris
03:08:56 <Crisium> 7-6 record
03:08:59 <Crisium> +39 SR
03:09:17 <Crisium> at first i was losing more SR then winning
03:09:35 <Crisium> then the game finally caught on that i was superior to my teammates, and matched with with masters even tho im 3300
03:09:43 <Crisium> so i won more than lost
03:09:52 <Crisium> thank you game, better late than never
03:10:08 <Crisium> next time stop the 2x rage quitters when my opposing teams got 0
03:10:11 <Crisium> that would be nice
03:11:00 <skram> i lost 2 games where i had a nice team
03:11:23 <skram> communicating and everything, they were just real bad
03:11:27 <Crisium> my last 2 games where both losses where my moira outhealed mercy. i want to be clear: mercy outheals moira at every rank
03:11:30 <Crisium> so wtf
03:12:25 <skram> except in plat and diamond i guess
03:13:58 <Crisium> nope, on overbuff, mercy is the premier healing at every rank
03:14:03 <Crisium> except when they pair with me
03:32:48 <Camail> after starting the AOT game I'm getting really tempted to read the manga
03:33:09 <Camail> \before, it was easy to just ignore it and wait for season 2...but I'm guessing s3 will be years away still
03:33:15 <Camail> and fuuuuuck that
03:33:25 <Crisium> attack on titan?
03:33:25 <Camail> I WANNA KNOW WHAT'S IN DAT BASEMENT
03:33:32 <Crisium> season 3 anime is next summer
03:33:35 <Camail> and thats like s4 or s5 shit
03:33:58 <Crisium> s5 if we are lucky
