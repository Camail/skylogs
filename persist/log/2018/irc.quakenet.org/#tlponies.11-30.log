09:08:07 <zk> I come on every once in a while!
09:08:10 <zk> Work mostly
09:08:28 <zk> I do theatre and improv a lot too now
09:08:40 <DuB`> I will be the work, but not until next summer :P
09:08:46 <zk> Started own improv troupe, trying to find name
09:08:46 <DuB`> School and free time for now!
09:08:52 <DuB`> Oooh

09:15:49 <DuB`> Dot is a pro engineer
09:15:56 <DuB`> However I'm not sure he knows much about engines at all
09:17:11 <carcinization> what about ears?
09:17:16 <DoT|Phone> actually! most of my mechanical theory was about engines
09:17:37 <DoT|Phone> and a lot of my electrical was on motors/generators
09:17:55 <DuB`> Oh well then
09:18:00 <DuB`> The realest engineer
09:18:05 <DoT|Phone> all completely useless to what I do

09:20:29 <DoT|Phone> and trains
09:20:41 <DoT|Phone> trains are the best part of factorio
09:23:39 <zk> Trains go fast
09:23:47 <zk> But not as fast as spaceships
09:24:06 <zk> I'm programming an app for delivery services

09:25:15 <zk> I'm jealous of dub and his no responsibilities

09:31:14 <zk> Hi reif
09:31:39 <DuB`> Bio does not allow progress
09:31:41 <DuB`> Only frog slaughter
09:31:46 <DuB`> Frog genocide
09:32:54 <DoT|Phone> that one session of ottus being ok with mass murder is still haunting us
09:33:40 <zk> Who is ottus?
09:33:43 <DuB`> Frogs don't go to Dnd heaven
09:34:20 <DoT|Phone> my halfling paladin
09:35:16 <DoT|Phone> they seemed aggressive at the time!
09:36:37 <zk> Poor frogs
09:40:36 <DuB`> They WERE quite poor...
09:40:45 <DuB`> Just chests full of copper coins...
09:40:57 <DuB`> We slaughtered them for pennies.
09:41:18 <DoT|Phone> need to slaughter lizards too even it out
09:41:34 <DoT|Phone> it's all about balance
09:41:36 <DoT|Phone> right?
09:41:54 <DuB`> We should
09:42:41 <DoT|Phone> how badly you think we will mess with bio if we decide to go out to the battle
09:43:06 <DuB`> lul
09:43:35 <zk> Won't he tpk then?
09:43:47 <DoT|Phone> lol probably
09:44:04 <zk> I thought dot was running a campaign no?
09:44:13 <DoT|Phone> but dub can probably sit in the castle with bow and pot shot them
09:44:37 <DuB`> And skulker means I can do so without being revealed!
09:44:43 <DuB`> ... I never use that feat.
09:44:57 <DoT|Phone> I ran lmop zk and will run something once this module is done
09:45:22 <DoT|Phone> to give bio a break before he runs second part
09:47:06 <DoT|Phone> we can head back up to that ghost tower. we had a nice view there
09:48:36 <DoT|Phone> we killed about 20 frogs to unbalance the situation. so killing about 10 lizard folk should solve it.
09:48:52 <DoT|Phone> we will kill a few more just to be safe
09:49:52 <DuB`> Perfec
09:49:58 <DuB`> Now I 3am sleep >_>

13:10:46 <Rawr|Phone> Indeed
