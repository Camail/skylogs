20:20:38 <Dot> why  is this country
20:21:51 <reification> visit skram then come back and it will seem warmer :p
20:23:08 <BioPhone> Is winter dort
20:23:20 <BioPhone> It does the cold now
20:25:22 <Dot> but my heating isnt working yet
20:25:29 <Dot> cant it wait?
20:25:59 <BioPhone> Man, I'd pay a little more for a working appt. Dot, so many issue!
20:26:28 <Dot> haha
20:26:52 <Dot> i had 2 options, the other was above a smelly fish and chips shop
20:29:13 <skrm> good choice
20:29:33 <skrm> also what you mean your heating isnt working yet
20:29:34 <skrm> dot its winter
20:29:38 <skrm> this is how people die
20:31:18 <Dot> the landlord thought it best to replace the old storage heaters
20:31:24 <Dot> with bran new electrical ones
20:31:55 <Dot> but it seems the circuite the heaters are on is timed to be on from midnight till 7 am
20:32:10 <skrm> ??
20:32:17 <skrm> thats like the opposite of what you want
20:34:28 <skrm> the chimney sweeper guy visited yesterday so now im allowed to set things on fire in my home
20:34:56 <Dot> you have so many fires in your life skram

20:43:13 <skrm> its fine, i know all the firemen by name now
20:47:45 <Camail> skram you should eat something tasty every time there is a fire
20:47:50 <Camail> so you associate fire with good feelings
20:47:57 <Camail> then you start lighting fires to feel alive
20:50:35 <skrm> hmm
