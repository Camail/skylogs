03:44:57 <Camail> i wandered into a portal and all of a sudden these important NPCs are trying to kill me, luckily they aren't important to MY party so i have no issues killing them all
03:45:16 <Camail> and it will make one of the godwoken REAL angry, and i hate him so that's even better

15:55:50 <Dot`> Bio
15:56:00 <Dot`> Biiiooo
15:56:39 <Camail> the one thing that that CR gets wrong is that they sub-gate vods
15:57:04 <Camail> it's so weird when channels do that, i've never understood it
15:57:46 <Zounds> To annoy people from other timezones
15:57:49 <Zounds> it is the only reason
15:58:06 <Camail> and we all know how twitch works, its defaulted to be free
15:58:13 <Camail> all they're doing is hitting a toggle
15:58:26 <Camail> there is zero technical reason to gate them
15:58:39 <Camail> its just a misguided effort to makes subs "worth it"
15:58:57 <Camail> by intentionally giving your general audience less features
15:59:05 <Zounds> Well I think on something as long-form as a DnD show they probably do get a few subs out of it
15:59:16 <Zounds> Since not many people will sit through the entire thing every time its on
15:59:28 <Camail> yea sure, it's probably effective, but it's shitty
15:59:38 <Zounds> Yes :/
15:59:54 <Camail> lots of marketing strategies are effective and also aggressive, just sad to see it
16:00:14 <Camail> G&S poisoned their brains and how they approach twitch
16:10:40 <Dot`> new PAX means new aquisitions inc to watch, yay

23:14:54 <Dot`> vote*
23:14:58 <Dot`> then it happend
23:15:01 <Dot`> the end
23:15:06 <DuB`> ripp
23:15:09 <Zounds> That's extremely short sighted
23:15:56 <Dot`> the vote happend like 1 month after i got into the country, i wasntaroud for the buildup
23:16:00 <Zounds> Can't blame the others if people are too dumb and lazy to vote themselves
23:16:10 <Dot`> so im not a good source

23:34:35 <Dot`> skram, you should watch them, i tihnk you would like chris perkins DM style
23:36:29 <skram> how many dwarfs are in it
23:37:33 <Dot`> 1
23:37:46 <skram> a clear shortage
23:37:49 <Dot`> NPC's i dont recall though

23:38:16 <Camail> is there 1 dwarf? who?
23:38:27 <Dot`> brinwin was a dwarf wasnt he?
23:38:27 <skram> no PCs?
23:38:44 <Camail> binwin hasnt been a part of aqinc for years
23:38:50 <Dot`> shhh
23:38:56 <Dot`> he was at the start
23:39:02 <Dot`> which is where skram will be
23:39:10 <skram> hard pass then
23:39:14 <Camail> you dont need to watch old aqinc
23:39:22 <Camail> its as episodic as it gets
23:39:38 <Dot`> it is better tohugh to have some idea about who the characters are
23:39:57 <Dot`> and they make a lot of old joke refrances normaly
23:41:09 <Camail> i'd say watch the last few years, which amounts to like 10 shows
23:41:41 <Dot`> yea, you wouldnt need to listen to all the podcasts 
23:41:45 <Camail> the major barrier to entry for any dnd show is the time commitment, that's th eone thing this show has over all the others
23:42:30 <Camail> you lose nothing if you start with the tomb of annihilation arc
23:42:41 <Camail> that's the only time when continuity has actually existed 
23:45:14 <Dot`> i forgot will wheaton use to be a part of it
23:51:17 <skram> its okay theres a recap thing
23:52:33 <Dot`> people seem t osay Pax Prime 2013 is probably best place to start
23:53:01 <skram> im already 15 minutes into pax 2017
23:53:18 <Dot`> watch that then
23:53:57 <skram> who are these nerds though
23:54:24 <Dot`> DM is chris perkins, one of the main writers for WotC
23:54:30 <Dot`> i think, maybe lead writer
23:54:32 <skram> right
23:54:37 <Dot`> i forget his exact position
23:54:54 <Dot`> Patrick rothfuss is a famous fantasy authour
23:55:27 <Dot`> the cleric whos name escapes me is a main guy form penny arcade
23:55:55 <Dot`> and the 4th i forget, also the 4th gets swapped out requalarly
23:56:08 <skram> is he the bald guy or the guy that looks like rick rubins apprentice
23:56:17 <Dot`> of right
23:56:21 <Dot`> 2 are from penny arcade
23:56:26 <Dot`> jim darkmagic
23:56:32 <Dot`> and oman dran
23:56:34 <skram> the guy with the lisp
23:56:53 <skram> and witch lady?
23:57:30 <Dot`> patrick rothfus is back left
23:57:45 <skram> right
23:57:55 <Dot`> next to him is jerry holkins, paeeny arcade
23:58:02 <Dot`> penny
23:58:26 <Dot`> then back right is  Mike Krahulik, Penny Arcade
23:58:44 <Dot`> and the 4th that year was Morgan Webb
23:59:14 <Dot`> who i havnt ever seen anywhere else
