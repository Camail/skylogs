03:06:58 <Camail> like watch the first half where they play out the game
03:07:05 <Camail> but then the "what do they do from here" was bad

15:06:00 <Phearlock> WHY IS THERE SO MUCH SNOW
15:09:06 <Dot`> SNOW!?
15:09:09 <Dot`> i want snow
15:10:00 <Phearlock> you can come here
15:10:02 <Phearlock> and shovel it for me
15:59:08 <Bio> po
15:59:16 <Bio> gmorn
16:22:50 <Dot`> Hey bio
16:23:12 <Dot`> phear, i have never shoveld snow, i would like to once
16:23:16 <Dot`> probably never again
16:23:30 <Bio> you dun wanna shovel sno dot
16:23:36 <Bio> take it from someone who has =D
16:23:55 <Dot`> but i do! just once
16:27:16 <Phearlock> I mean if you've ever shoveled earth or anything like that
16:27:46 <Dot`> its not the same phear, its snow!
16:27:53 <Phearlock> it's like that but a bit more lightweight-to-volume and colder
16:33:46 <Bio> yeh, then you miss shovel and snow gets on ur shoes 
16:33:53 <Bio> and you wish for the release of death
16:34:31 <Phearlock> I don't really give a shit if it lands on my shoe
16:34:42 <Phearlock> but I have stairs I gotta shovel and that's annoying
16:35:20 <Phearlock> either you walk down them and shovel from the bottom up, easier to work but you crushed the snow coming down so it's not as even and easy to move around your footprints.
16:35:37 <Phearlock> or you shovel from the top down and that's annoying as you have to bend really far
16:46:55 <Dot`> sounds dangerous

20:30:38 <Camail> then we man hunted
20:30:52 <Camail> then after we finished that we chased a guy around town who beat us to a landmark
20:31:01 <Camail> we chased him around a truck and he was terrified 
20:31:09 <Camail> EMERGENT GAMEPLAY
20:31:24 <Camail> but yea group is done fun was had, I can DZ whenever you guys want
20:35:09 <Dot`> i seem to have accedentally started a main mission
20:35:21 <Dot`> i was heading to a safe house and ended up disarming turrests
20:37:38 <Camail> you can leave them
20:37:51 <Camail> yea one main mission is right nest to a safe house its annoying
20:37:56 <Camail> i started that mission life 6 times
20:38:06 <Camail> watching the same two guys get murdered by turrets over and over
20:38:12 <Camail> i think that is their personal hell
20:52:20 <Bio> greetings fromnap
20:54:40 <Camail> I really need a better scope for my sniper

21:04:27 <Bio> I have this 1 gal jug of what used to be tropicana oj next to me
21:04:52 <Bio> i've resolved to drink no sodas in jan, and instead drink at least one of it of water a day
21:04:56 <Bio> so far so good
21:05:05 <Bio> but man, its a lot of water
21:05:39 <Bio> when i was swimming in college, I would drink 2 of these a day during practices
22:28:51 <Camail> ok so new highest single hit is 267k
22:29:42 <Camail> yea ignoring soda is like, by far the easiest health decision
