22:27:20 <Dot`> wait for mouse
22:28:06 <Zounds> I could stack again
22:28:13 <Zounds> interested Crisium ?
22:28:38 <DuB`> Mouse is in Utah now
22:28:41 <DuB`> SOMEWHERE
22:29:40 <DuB`> Probably the warm southerly parts

22:30:29 <Crisium> goofing off in PTR with a friend
22:30:36 <DuB`> Journeyed forth from Las Vegas into the dry wasteland
22:43:50 <DuB`> Gotta watch twitch ads for bits to get free OWL skin~
22:48:52 <Camail> i ahvent been able to watch an ad for bits in a long time
22:49:09 <Camail> got like $20 through doing them, maybe i got cut off
22:50:52 <DuB`> Haha
22:50:55 <DuB`> I just need 100 bits!
22:54:05 <carcinisation> can't get bits thru ads so i do the surveys
23:02:35 <Camail> are they the twitchrpg surveys?
23:17:42 <carcinisation> yes
23:20:58 <Camail> twitch as a whole is a service which is actually not terrible, even after being picked up by amazon
23:21:41 <Camail> people love making drama about the TOS, which is frankly boring and overshadowing all the other work they've done for streamers and viewers
23:47:11 <Zounds> natt natt pons
