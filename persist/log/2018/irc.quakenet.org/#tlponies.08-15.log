00:05:57 <Camail> oh damn, the twist in Tyranny is so GOOD
00:06:42 <Camail> cements it as a better game than poe2, and depending on the ending, maybe poe1?

00:53:26 <Micen|Droid> A part of me is just happy he has said anything. 
01:31:57 <Camail> after he faded away i never heard anyone say anything good about him
02:25:41 <Camail> man this game is fuuun
04:09:28 <Camail> good game, not as good as poe1, but I'd recommend it to anyone. Easily one of the most satisfying endings for a video game
04:10:35 <Camail> i honestly believe it has the most ambitious decision tree of any game ever made
04:11:11 <Camail> there's easily a third of the game that i didnt even see

16:42:16 <Cane> I'm convinced the best thing GSC could do to tease STALKER 2 in-game footage would be to just show an atmospheric campfire scene with slavic guitar music while rain is slowly starting to fall.
16:49:15 <Dot> i would pre order
16:52:11 <Cane> Ooh, maybe it could end with a siren and the sound of thunder, and everyone going inside before it fades to black and just says "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2"
16:52:15 <Cane> EVERYONE would preorder.
16:53:49 <Dot> AAHAHH

22:03:17 <Phearlock> Should watch some dotes
22:06:58 <Camail> i'm watching day9's ti8 stream, mostly cuz it's always fun to listen to the way he thinks about games
22:07:14 <Phearlock> That sounds like fun
22:19:19 <Camail> Phearlock  did you ever play tyranny?
22:19:30 <Camail> because if you wanna play battlemage, boy is that the game to play
22:19:33 <Phearlock> Yeah I played through it once on release
22:19:38 <Phearlock> Was good
22:19:55 <Phearlock> Been meaning to go back but never got around to it
22:20:59 <Camail> i just finished it, probably gonna replay it in like 6 months
22:22:49 <Phearlock> Day9 stream is very chill.
22:23:08 <Camail> yea he's just going at his own pace
22:23:40 <Phearlock> Also got OG vs TL up since that game has been super active and back and forth for the past 30 mins
22:43:25 <Bio> yeh, then tl said thats enough and stomped
22:43:27 <Bio> xD
22:44:01 <Bio> EG doing pretty good too
22:44:10 <Bio> 3-0 so far
22:44:27 <Bio> even with arteezy pos 5
22:44:35 <Bio> cause fly misclicked
22:44:38 <Phearlock> I heard about that
22:44:39 <Phearlock> hilarious
22:44:53 <Bio> luckily i don't have him on my fantasy
22:54:20 <reification> lol https://clips.twitch.tv/OnerousGleamingSnoodTinyFace
22:54:21 <Phearlock> Need more Fly carry
22:54:21 <Camail> welp
23:10:47 <Phearlock> haha this TL draft
23:11:10 <Phearlock> probably swaps though
23:11:18 <Phearlock> But I just want boats
23:25:34 <Bio> this TL GAME
23:25:38 <Bio> is so fuckin clowny
23:25:39 <Phearlock> yes
23:25:45 <Phearlock> Feels like last game but more clown
23:25:54 <Phearlock> 30 kills 12 mins
23:28:51 <Bio> A click dota
23:46:25 <Phearlock> Did TL just like spend 25 mins luring the enemy into a false sense of "just run at them" and then just decide to win some fights near their base?
