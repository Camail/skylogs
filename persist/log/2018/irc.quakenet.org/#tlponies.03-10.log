00:53:56 <Runbunny> oh right tax returns.
00:54:24 <DuB`> :P
00:54:31 <DuB`> I got my $450 back this week
00:54:42 <DuB`> Now I can splurge on RENT!
00:55:15 <Runbunny> freaking 27031 people are trying to check their tax returns right now. It's 2 am.

02:47:42 <Cane> Help, I want to play Dwarf Fortress but I've forgotten how, and I'm scared that if I remember how I won't stop for a month.
02:54:53 <Crisium> who is the dwarf here
02:54:56 <Crisium> is bio?
02:55:56 <Cane> There's a couple. Dot` is one.
03:01:07 <Cane> Heh, I found this again. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N8vtiVknIgXpElsUaoq0kIZX0xxewxzCyI41zTYSJp0/edit?usp=sharing
03:01:13 <Cane> I forgot you were a dwarf in that run Crisium.
03:01:56 <Crisium> boozemaker LuL
03:03:42 <Crisium> Crisium went looking for more alcoholberries. Naturally the fort universally considered this a matter of great urgency, so I sent a military guard to escort him. 
03:04:54 <Crisium> Cane you should 6 stack with us again in OW
03:05:00 <Crisium> we even got Camail to join us this week
03:05:13 <Cane> Oh snap. Did Bio play or did he ragequit again?
03:05:23 <Crisium> he played a few days go
03:22:43 <Cane> "If any Dwarves die, you should build them a memorial, because reasons. Or not. Either¬ís good."
03:23:04 <Cane> Apparently when I wrote this tutorial I was an asshole.
03:50:33 <Micen|Droid_> Whats everyone up to? 
04:15:06 <Cane> Being a super nerd.
04:15:13 <Cane> Choosing a tileset for Dwarf Fortress.
04:16:29 <DuB`> "I'm scared that if I remember how I won't stop for a month."
04:16:43 <DuB`> I think you should totally play dorfs, Cane, for entirely selfish reasons.
04:16:50 <DuB`> I just love the stories that come out of it :P
04:17:03 <DuB`> But I don't think I'd ever subject MYSELF to all the "fun".
04:19:11 <Cane> Yeah, I'm sad that Riverhold stories never had a conclusion because I stopped playing that one due to the new big update coming out right around then.
04:19:19 <Cane> It was fun to write. =)

14:30:08 <Cane> I don't speak Spanish but I'm pretty sure the author is laughing at all the weirdoes making fancy forts.
14:51:07 <Zounds> my high school spanish tells me he's pretty much describing dwarf fortress for those who have never heard of it despite its huge popularity within gaming circles
14:53:21 <skrm> its kicking my ass Zounds 
14:54:14 <Zounds> Early in the article I think he talks about how minecrafts world generation may have initally been inspired by df or games like it
