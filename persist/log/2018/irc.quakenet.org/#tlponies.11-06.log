18:46:16 <Camail> reif
18:46:29 <Camail> have you beaten sts yet
18:46:47 <Camail> i've been on a rimworld kick so i havent ground it out yet
18:46:57 <carcinization> no i done one asc run and died at final boss
18:47:06 <carcinization> how do you win?
18:47:35 <Camail> i'm not 100% on this, but i think you need to win once on each character
18:47:43 <Camail> dunno if it needs to be asc or not
18:47:51 <Camail> then you get the ability to pick up 3 keys
18:48:37 <Camail> you pick up one from the bonfire instead of upgrading/resting, one from a special elite, and one from a chest instead of getting a relic
18:48:51 <Camail> dunno if those have to be in asc or not either
18:49:10 <carcinization> neat. i'll try soon but i only do asc/daily now
18:49:13 <Camail> then after act 3 you go to a special act 4, and i know almost nothing about that
19:08:41 <DuB`> https://i.imgur.com/oHrcivQ.gifv
19:25:15 <DuB`> I'm on NA OW
