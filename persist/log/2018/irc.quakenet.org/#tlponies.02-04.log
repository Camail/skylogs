02:25:51 <skram> heck yeah my boi
02:26:14 <skram> gonna murder some gosh dang dudes
02:26:21 <Dot`> woohoo
02:26:32 <Dot`> just not 13 more thugs pls
02:26:48 <skram> this time we're going for 14
02:27:24 <Micen> I wish my last game of dnd didnt leave such a bad taste in my mouth. 
02:27:59 <Micen> have i told my bad dnd story?
02:28:39 <skram> tell it
02:30:03 <Bio> dnd stories
02:31:56 <Micen> okay, so i was dming for two players(one who had never touched the game, and the other brought up on 3.5) while we were looking for a couple more, after talking to the new guy, decide to let Mercer's Blood Hunter into the game, since it was pretty much exactly what he was saying he wanted. (he later chose otherwise.)
02:32:38 <Dot`> ooo, i recall this story
02:32:48 <skram> well i dont
02:33:08 <Micen> So i talked to the other player and he seemed fine with what was in the book, then he started sending me homebrew races from the dndwiki that could fly 90ft a round and use like 4d10 breath weapons at level 1
02:34:39 <Micen> so I explained to him that those things were not balance, but if he wanted to, as an arc, we could work some of that in eventually, but he couldnt start with it. He got angry and grumbly about it, but finally said okay, and he bought one of those starter kits and a dm screen for me, so teaching the game would be easy. 
02:34:50 <Micen> which was very nice of him!
02:35:58 <Micen> So we decide to run the included Phandelver module, and i tell him i need a week to look over everything and get print outs and get organized and insure i have everything i need, since we were hanging out once a week. 
02:37:28 <Micen> I get a call twelve hours later after he handed everything to me, asking if i wanted to go over to new guys house and to bring the box so we can go over stuff after some deck testing for DBZ cards. 
02:40:10 <Micen> I say sure and decide to hold session zero at that time and do character creation. I do 4d6 and drop one, add it up and you keep your score if it is over ... i forgot the number, but it was like 75 or something since it can make some interesting characters. 
02:43:03 <Micen> note, i explained this to them a few times, that it can make for more interesting characters to rp and play. So they complained for like a half hour, until i let them reroll, since i wanted to get more into the character creation process. So I handed them a like 5 question print out of questions for their background to help them get started. New guy tries, 3.5 guy...
02:43:12 <Micen> "Do you have any siblings?" Yes
02:43:36 <Micen> "Do you worship any religion or deity?"No
02:43:41 <Micen> like that for every question. 
02:44:16 <Bio> ROFL
02:44:36 <Micen> So i tell them, that i need time to build the hook since they are doing their own thing, and because i wanted to talk to them in private about their characters
02:45:13 <skram> such character depth
02:45:48 <Dot`> just need xanathars nowdays
02:45:50 <Micen> oh! New guy wants to play a drow, I explain that drow are normally frowned upon and you will be met with hostility mostly everywhere. He says sure, it seems interesting to play
02:47:12 <Micen> 3.5 guy is playing human fighter, and ooc is picking on him hard for picking drow, and a ranger, making fun of him at near every chance he has for picking something not typical. 
02:48:25 <Micen> So, I had left the actual module at my desk at my house since i didnt plan on actual playing, and wanted to over prepare encounter cards and what not. I inform them of this and 3.5 guy is talking in the car
02:50:51 <Micen> to new guy, who had diligently read the PHB, about his plan "I think i am going to go 6 in fighter, 2 in cleric, 2 in paladin , 8 in bard." or something like that." 
02:51:05 <skram> ???
02:52:20 <Micen> I ask, "If you are going to be a cleric or paladin, where are you getting this divine energy from, one of those questions was geared specifically towards that. "Well, just for the mechanics and class features of those classes." was the answer he gave. 
02:52:44 <Micen> those might not have been the numbers because rogue was in there as well "for disengage" 
02:53:21 <skram> did he plan 20 leves in advance
02:53:25 <Micen> yes. 
02:53:37 <skram> well then
02:53:42 <Micen> completely planning to ignore and growth from the story. 
02:53:48 <Micen> any growth*
02:54:18 <Dot`> im more concerned that LMop is only 5 lvls long
02:54:34 <Micen> we were using that as a jumping point. 
02:54:59 <Micen> and going to go into either another module or see if they wanted to just roam, if they liked the characters
02:56:22 <Dot`> i see nothing really wrong with planning though, like he knows what he wants his character to be, he has a vision
02:56:32 <Dot`> it may change, it may not
02:56:38 <Micen> but we get the module, and then head back, 3.5 man complains that I should have given him more time on the backstory questions, and i explain again that I wasnt planning on actually playing that night and wanted to build characters. 
02:57:48 <Micen> and now we get to the "Fun" part of the story.
02:59:21 <Micen> Me, not having had time to do the math to alter the stat blocks to suit two players instead of four, do my best with the first few groups of the module, i get a complaint that they are too easy, and to just play them for a normal group. 
02:59:51 <Micen> We get to the uhh
03:00:34 <Micen> whats the big guy in the first cave with the goblins?
03:00:43 <Dot`> klarg
03:01:04 <skram> KLARG!
03:01:33 <Micen> yeah, they get to him, and complain because the 3.5 fighter is being loud and in his face, "Why is he focusing just me" 
03:02:18 <Micen> I explain that his companion is a drow ranger, in a cave. Who is is going to focus, the guy out of his range, or the loud in his face fighter. 
03:02:45 <Micen> So they kill him, they kill the npc they are supposed to save. 
03:02:53 <Dot`> he would obviosly focus the dwarf cleric and one shot him
03:02:59 <Dot`> easy choice
03:03:06 <skram> fuk u dit
03:03:09 <skram> dot
03:03:28 <Bio> i meaaaaaannnn
03:03:30 <Bio> =D
03:03:43 <DuB`> OOF 30 minute nap
03:04:03 <Bio> dub
03:04:04 <Bio> pls
03:04:08 <Bio> this is srs
03:04:25 <Dot`> micen. lvl 1 fights cant be well balanced
03:04:57 <Dot`> these bastards killed klarg before he could do anything then 3 got knocked out by one of his golbin bodyguards
03:05:42 <Dot`> lvl 1 is always 1 dice roll from disaster
03:06:21 <DuB`> rip vanessa
03:06:41 <Dot`> got better
03:06:52 <DuB`> :P
03:06:57 <skram> vanessa died because cam wanted to do a prison escape thing and sent some l33t henchmen after us
03:07:08 <skram> also she was level 5??
03:07:08 <Bio> dub should join us
03:07:14 <Bio> we need more ranged
03:07:16 <Bio> =D
03:07:40 <Dot`> cam hada had some great experiences and tried to force those moments to be recreated
03:07:47 <Dot`> it was harsh
03:07:56 <skram> Micen: How did you progress after they killed barry bluejeans?
03:08:11 <Micen> oh, 3.5 guy was looking over my screen the entire time at my dice rolls, calling if things hit before i could
03:08:21 <Dot`> excuse you skram, KING Klarg
03:08:24 <skram> fun group
03:08:48 <skram> wait did he have any wolves in our thing Dot`?
03:09:10 <Dot`> i would have invited dub but he decided school was more important
03:09:18 <skram> what a JERK
03:09:22 <DuB`> :(
03:09:23 <Micen> they got to town, i dropped the hooks about the hideout as they went seeking, the drow player smart and was completely covered 
03:09:25 <Dot`> yea, he had ripper
03:09:30 <DuB`> What day do you usually play?
03:09:47 <skram> we dont know yet
03:10:01 <DuB`> o
03:10:12 <skram> But sundays probably?
03:11:07 <Dot`> yea,maybe,  except every 3rd(?) week when skram works
03:11:36 <skram> every 6th!
03:13:08 <Dot`> but its like 9am bio time sunday
03:13:14 <Micen> So, drow player want to go explore the hide out. Fighter was like "I was in the military, im going to go back to neverwinter and see if I can get some troops to come take care of this problem." I told him that was fine, but it would take time to get back, he had just enough to rent a horse  and make it back quicker
03:13:15 <Dot`> so early
03:13:42 <Dot`> lol micen
03:13:43 <DuB`> Naw, got church 'n stuff
03:14:23 <skram> i admire his willingness to be like fuck this and ignore the carefully crafted plot
03:15:34 <Micen> i roll on tables to see if he gets attacked, he doesnt, and makes it back. So i make up some person higher up for him to meet, some strong woman with a big sword to basically tell him to go fuck back off, and hint a giants elsewhere, setting up for Storm Kings Thunder, should they choose to continue. 
03:15:57 <Micen> and he replies to me after meeting her "Oh great, the strong woman trope." 
03:16:36 <Dot`> everything in DnD is atrope, its all been done so much
03:16:38 <Micen> I wanted to yell at him that he was playing dnd, and it is mostly tropes. but i didnt. I bit my tongue
03:16:53 <Dot`> and especially in LMoP, its designed that way
03:17:15 <Dot`> its very "classical" fantasy, its what people recognise
03:19:01 <Micen> oh wait! i am bad at story telling
03:19:32 <Micen> i forgot an important part, after asking around about the redbrands, they had the meeting in the street with the thugs. 
03:19:57 <Micen> and i was told, play them as the stat block says, dont alter anything. its too easy. 
03:20:00 <Dot`> skram and Bio are hald way through redbrand hideout
03:20:02 <Micen> So I say fine
03:20:13 <Micen> they dont get in the hideout. 
03:20:15 <Dot`> so carefull about spoilers with the story telling past there
03:20:21 <Dot`> ah
03:21:04 <skram> did they convince one of the redbrands to go inside and bring their friends out so they could kill them?
03:21:25 <Micen> the thugs approach them, tell them to pass through or go back. Figher attacks without a word. 
03:22:16 <Micen> they both die in 3 rounds, since they told me to play by the book. i took my screen down and rolled in the open with the block clear in the open
03:22:38 <Micen> They then complain that its unfair that they get multiple attacks a round. 
03:23:19 <Micen> to which i explain that thats why i was altering things, to make an interesting, and challenging experience. 
03:23:47 <Micen> they complain enough that they want to go back to before that fight and try it again. 
03:24:15 <skram> i didnt know you had save points in dnd
03:24:23 <skram> why didnt you tell us about this Dot`
03:24:48 <Dot`> because you opted into the HC mode
03:24:54 <skram> aah dang it
03:25:03 <Dot`> by being a dorf
03:25:06 <Micen> so after hearing them complain, and since i dont drive, not wanting to upset my ride home,  i reset the encounter. its the middle of the afternoon, you are on an open dirt road. 
03:25:07 <Dot`> who is no pansy elf
03:25:20 <Micen> fighter "for my action, I want to hide." 
03:25:22 <skram> YEAH B I O
03:25:43 <Micen> "Where are you hiding, i just explained you were stopped in the middle of a dirt road."
03:26:02 <Micen> "Well hide is an action i can take, I want to hide." 
03:26:15 <skram> thats...not how that works?
03:26:39 <Bio> skram i'm HALF coward
03:26:41 <Micen> so since i know they will complain if they dont kill these bandits, i let them kill them, then the trip to neverwinter and all that
03:27:25 <Bio> yeah, i like charming some dude and convincing his friend to lure all his friends out to their deaths better than save points
03:29:59 <Micen> So while I am talking to the drow,  dickhead guy starts to go through his dbz deck and do mock turns instead of listening at the table, then asking me to repeat after i completed things, and trying to distract other guy and talk over me.
03:31:12 <Micen> That was my breaking point, i sneak a text to my brother to "remind me that i need to get back to watch the kids while others go out."
03:32:04 <Dot`> thats also like a 7 hour session at that point
03:32:07 <Micen> 3.5 dude drive me home, and i bring up all these points as to why i will no longer dm for them in messenger, and then i find out that HE is mad at ME for not wanting to play
03:32:08 <Micen> yeah
03:32:12 <Micen> it was
03:33:43 <Dot`> https://itsalwayspony.deviantart.com/art/Sweetie-Box-729062912
03:34:04 <Micen> i tell new guy that it wasnt him, that he was a good player, but i couldnt do it for other guy, that we wanted different things. he wanted a video game, i wanted a story. 
03:37:15 <Micen> dot
03:37:24 <Micen> that is what i needed after that story
03:47:43 <Bio> come be murder hobos with us

09:25:38 <Micen|Droid> How are you today? 
09:25:45 <Rawr|Fone> Good morning micen!
09:25:49 <Rawr|Fone> Great!
09:25:55 <Rawr|Fone> How a boat you
09:26:54 <Micen|Droid> Doing okay. Been watching a lot of anime. 
09:27:13 <Rawr|Fone> Sounds nice
09:34:59 <Micen> its okay. but i am excited, i found out this anime has 75 more episodes than i thought
09:35:14 <Micen> which is super nice
09:36:25 <Rawr|Fone> I am guessing you like the show then
09:36:35 <Micen>  yeah Prince of Tennis is good
09:37:18 <Micen> but ill watch things that suck so i can completely justify my dislike of it
09:38:40 <Rawr|Fone> Is it about a royal who plays tennis
09:39:58 <Micen> depends on how loose you use the word royal.
09:40:37 <Micen> one could speculate that the main characters father was a king of the tennis world.

14:22:54 <Dot`> hey reof
14:23:12 <carcinisation> dot i played sym in open div
14:23:39 <Dot`> and you killed all the people?
14:23:50 <carcinisation> good job i practised with ponstack
14:24:46 <carcinisation> our people kept finding the grav so i had to switch for round 3, but before that i did plenty of killing
14:27:17 <carcinisation> also i find it funny they gave me half an ult in 3 seconds. that really shouldn't work in teams...

14:32:02 <Bio> silly alliance
14:36:52 <skram> king fuckups the wolfman
14:42:31 <Zounds> Still better than sylvanas
14:43:23 <skram> shoulda made baine warchief
14:43:30 <Zounds> But yes there was some moment in warcraft when instead of being king of stormwind it was suddenly king of the alliance
14:43:34 <skram> then there'd be like drum circles and stuff
14:43:53 <Zounds> It should still be vol'jin
14:43:56 <Zounds> he died pointlessly
14:44:23 <skram> lots of dying in this expac
14:44:34 <Zounds> Warcraft lore sucks dick
14:44:36 <skram> killed an ancient dragon aspect like it werent no big thing
14:45:02 <Zounds> It's very interesting on the surface and there's some cool characters
14:45:08 <Zounds> but look any deeper and it all goes to shit real fast
14:47:22 <Zounds> I always wanted my boy vol'jin to be chief
14:47:28 <Zounds> then he got it and did nothing during the worst expac
14:47:32 <Zounds> then died
14:47:34 <Zounds> sad!
14:52:58 <skram> sad!
14:53:06 <skram> I've always been fond of the warcraft universe
14:53:16 <skram> buts been slowly murdered by wow for the past 14 years
14:55:57 <Micen> worst murder has to be Illidan
14:56:33 <Bio> he got better from the murder tho
14:57:14 <Zounds> yeah the lore was good untill they had to trot out some big bad guy every couple of years
14:57:45 <Micen> I mean, where do you go after the biggest bad.
14:58:25 <Micen> the old gods are so otherworldly and not in the universe who knows if its even possible for them to die
14:58:26 <Bio> back to murdering each other for a bit
14:58:43 <Bio> then the COLD VOID probably
14:59:00 <Micen> I hope Jaina is the end boss of bfa
14:59:19 <Bio> jaina is already dead
14:59:23 <Bio> Kappa
14:59:37 <Zounds> Maybe we'll be the bad guy
14:59:44 <skram> ooh that would be fun
15:00:01 <Zounds> I've slaughtered hundreds of thousands
15:00:29 <Zounds> Usually just because some guy asked me to
15:00:45 <Micen> When you go into the last boss room of the raid, its just a shadow of your raid group using the new AI for the uncharted islands
15:01:00 <Micen> that would be sweet.
15:02:02 <Micen> or its like the one really good DK who soloed Kil'jaeden 
15:03:00 <skram> I did a quest yesterday where you had to kill raging ursa dudes
15:03:15 <skram> but there was another quest that i did and then the ursa dudes un-raged
15:03:24 <skram> but i still had to kill them because that guy told me to

17:12:51 <Zounds> gonna stack a bit later
17:13:00 <DuB`> :D
17:13:00 <Zounds> work now, play later? :P

17:13:07 <DuB`> So
17:13:07 <DuB`> lol
17:13:22 <DuB`> A few hours after we finished up QP, I hopped on for some mystery heroes
17:13:34 <DuB`> And literally queued into Rael+Cane+2 on my team
17:13:56 <Zounds> Hah nice
17:14:22 <DuB`> And then we stacked for all 9 arcade wins!

17:16:10 <Zounds> I've been enjoying playing Tracer and Genji a bit
17:16:20 <Zounds> Was getting pretty down about the small amount of heroes I always played
17:20:19 <DuB`> I want way more genji practice
17:20:45 <DuB`> He's one of my 3 most-played AND has my highest winrate but I still feel like I just don't use him super well  lol
17:20:49 <DuB`> Very challenging
17:23:07 <Zounds> It's hard when you're always on tank duty
17:23:09 <Zounds> I know the feel :P

17:56:55 <Bio> Well, thats bad positioning there
17:57:02 <Bio> besides, you can just orb
17:57:22 <Bio> I feel like enemy barriers should block the mist, but idk
18:04:02 <carcinisation> i don't think it would block much of my healing so i'm good with it

19:35:42 <Crisium> what do you play with
19:38:31 <DuB`> 800/5
19:38:48 <Crisium> thats around what most pros use
19:38:51 <DuB`> 1600/2.5 should be a lot better for OW 
19:38:57 <Crisium> mine is a bit high, im 1600/5.25
19:38:58 <DuB`> Same sens, no skipping according to this tool
19:39:10 <DuB`> Yeah
19:39:21 <Crisium> whats weird is that most pros play at 400,800, or 900 dpi
