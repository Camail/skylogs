21:32:48 <Zounds> I was talking about kobold maidens earlier
21:32:52 <Zounds> is your name related to the webcomic?
21:33:05 <skram> I dont do stomping
21:33:10 <skram> could do some tippy taps
21:34:07 <Crisium> yes
21:34:36 <Crisium> im a few months behind on the comic, but i liked the begins of it at least
21:35:47 <Zounds> I found myself wishing it was just a webcomic on the daily interaction between the dragon and the knight
21:35:53 <Zounds> They are sooper nice
21:35:55 <Crisium> yeah that was the best part
21:35:57 <Zounds> the rest of the stuff wasn't really my thing
21:36:06 <Zounds> except the kobold maidens looked nice I'll give them that
21:36:09 <Crisium> dragon being nerf over weapons lol
21:36:13 <Crisium> nerd*
21:36:35 <Crisium> and the bard was funny too
21:54:27 <Phearlock> I do require more cute dragons and kobolds
21:58:23 <Camail> oh god, phear i just one shot another ship
21:58:36 <Phearlock> oh dear
21:58:39 <Camail> the cannons that do double damage or great
21:58:46 <Camail> are*
21:59:06 <Camail> went from 80 to 0without even touching me
21:59:24 <Phearlock> Not really gotten any special guns yet
21:59:53 <Camail> there not enchanted, tho that would be sick
22:00:00 <Camail> just the shotgun variety sold at the city
22:00:14 <Camail> there's like 5-6 cannon types
22:01:08 <Phearlock> Right, have seen that one.
22:01:34 <Phearlock> Wondering if I should spend money on getting a small ship and upgrading it or just buying a big boat.
22:01:37 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:02:21 <Phearlock> As I just got to the point of having tons of money (when fine and exceptional weapons equipment starts being so common you can sell most of it)
22:08:08 <Camail> i bought the big boat and slowly upgraded it
22:08:28 <Camail> you have tog et used to spending multiple turns doing things slower
22:08:32 <Camail> like 2 turn turning
22:08:47 <Camail> but the damage is so worth it
22:09:07 <Camail> 5 cannons are strong
22:09:20 <Camail> and you only need 5 cannons because jibbing isn't worth it in a big ship
22:10:13 <Camail> then it costs like another 100k to full upgrade everything else
22:10:46 <Camail> I have one side of normal guns and one side of double barreled death, depending on how far away the game puts me on turn one
22:14:42 <Phearlock> ouch =D
22:19:50 <Camail> this game warrants a second playthrough more than most, there are so many factions that you just don't comprehend the world until quite a bit into the game
22:20:02 <Camail> so a second run can really be played with a purpose
22:20:12 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:27:59 <Phearlock> I feel like I'm doing ok with not locking out quests by making people angry at me yet.
22:28:10 <Phearlock> A few maybe =)
22:33:27 <Camail> I did that on accident once, and then just now on purpose
22:33:44 <Camail> but i kinda want to make a pirate that attacks everyone but the principi
22:49:59 <Camail> 257 damage in one hit...monk+cipher is really good
22:50:10 <Phearlock> ouch D=
22:50:27 <Phearlock> Warrior/Wizard is working out super well for tanking.
22:50:41 <Camail> i go around 1v1ing the squishies to gain a ton of focus, then one shot big boys
22:50:53 <Camail> turns out raw damage is really good
22:51:39 <Camail> funnily enough the multiclasses that your party can be are the least interesting to me
22:51:52 <Camail> range+wizard is useful but boring
22:51:56 <Camail> ranger*
22:52:13 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:52:19 <Phearlock> they picked some very reasonable ones. But in that regard, also pretty chill ones.
22:52:37 <Phearlock> I'm enjoying Maias ranger/rogue combo though.
22:53:11 <Phearlock> Adding sneak attack to the normal set of ranged skills is.. well, just darn reliable
22:57:17 <Camail> yea, i guess I just dont like guns in this game, too much time doing nothing
22:57:31 <Camail> so I'm kinda meh on the ranger with the gun focus
22:57:45 <Camail> meanwhile i can be doing so much more dps with anything else
22:58:50 <Camail> pistols are fine, you can get unique items that reduce reload time
22:58:59 <Camail> then it's almost like a normal weapon
