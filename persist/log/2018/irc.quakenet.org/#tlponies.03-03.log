22:09:02 <Yolteotl> I'm stressed
22:09:15 <Dot`> would dub look like a big red bird with fuzzy pink feet?
22:09:37 <skram> is DuB` actually a bird
22:10:05 <skram> He'd be a cockatiel in that case
22:10:09 <skram> with blushed cheeks
22:12:32 <DuB`> ???
22:13:05 <skram> you know, the ones with red circles on their cheeks
22:13:32 <DuB`> Yes
22:13:41 <DuB`> I'm mostly confused about dot's question
22:13:58 <skram> He thinks you're a harpy
22:14:02 <skram> I think thats mean and untrue
22:14:07 <Dot`> its from MASH
22:14:13 <Dot`> i cant help your all uncultured
