21:38:02 <Dot> name ONE person or thing that survived that one shot
21:38:08 <Dot> that wasnt the part
21:38:10 <Dot> y
21:38:35 <skrm> ...
21:38:38 <skrm> i really cant
21:39:26 <Dot> even the wizards tower died
21:39:31 <skrm> haha!
21:39:36 <skrm> its trueee
21:43:35 <Bio> nothing happened tho
21:45:09 <Dot> nothing
22:23:14 <Dot> apparently a bunch of large streamers got banned for playing music on stream
22:23:31 <Dot> twitch decided to crack down on it rrandomly
22:25:08 <Camail> yup that happens when platforms start making real money
22:25:29 <Camail> it's not random, they just got put on the radar of the music industry
22:26:28 <Camail> "It's never been allowed to stream copyrighted music, but now that the big labels realized how big Twitch is, you can expect more and more DMCA takedowns for copyrighted music."
22:27:15 <Camail> twitch is passing the buck and implying that labels are the reason
22:27:29 <Camail> and i believe them, because they never did this before, even when sold to amazon
22:28:56 <Dot> wel its more sudden than rndom, its been coming for a long time but apprently there was no forewarning before the bans started 
22:29:06 <Dot> went from muting vods to takedowns
22:32:25 <Camail> that's probably on the advice from legal; PMing the streamers and warning them not to do it would be nicer, but strictly speaking they were supposed to be doing this kind of thing the entire time
22:33:41 <Camail> i dont know exact details but all their actions fit under a well used umbrella
22:36:01 <Dot> probably didnt help having the music catagory with people just streaming music and making money from it with subs/donations
22:37:06 <Camail> I would probably have a more emotional reaction if i ever listened to music
22:38:22 <Dot> i will enjoy listening to music for like a week, then wont for a few months
22:38:29 <Dot> and repeat the cycle

23:22:13 <Camail> so that's a thing
