07:31:02 <DuB`> ez
07:32:29 <DuB`> We did a quickplay tdm with 4 of us and smashed 'em 75-49!
07:45:58 <Camail> csgo br is weird, but i figured it out
07:46:07 <Camail> objectively kinda ass because its only pistols and smgs
07:46:17 <DuB`> Huh
07:46:29 <Camail> csgo is free, also a royale
07:46:42 <Camail> some sweeping changes today

18:54:26 <Zounds_> small girls with giant weapons is the best
18:54:33 <Zounds_> it would be great for dva imo
18:55:10 <Zounds_> small women I should say, seems strange to call dva girl
18:56:13 <skrm> dva is 19

19:35:22 <Camail> yo
19:39:06 <Dot`> oy
19:39:34 <Camail> we gotta try the csgo br at some point
19:52:13 <Camail> the one truly interesting features is that it gives you map hacks
19:52:27 <Camail> where you know which grids on the map have at least 1 player in them
19:53:45 <Camail> and also some super hackey sub-goals like assassination, hostage rescue, and bomb plants
19:54:30 <Zounds_> how long is a match typically
19:55:46 <Camail> well, either 2 minutes or at most 10
19:55:51 <Camail> its really low pop
19:55:57 <Camail> and thats solo
19:56:10 <Camail> with 2s there are only 9 teams, 3s have 6
19:57:28 <Zounds_> I've avoided BRs because of loot RNG and the long stretches of not much happening
19:58:22 <Camail> the first concern exists, but is kinda mitigated, the second is gone, if you're agressive
19:58:40 <Camail> you can force fights because you know which hex they are in
19:58:57 <Camail> and there is a buy menu where if you have enough cash you can just buy a gun
19:59:11 <Camail> thnea  drone brings it to you
19:59:23 <Camail> which also means that you can follow othe rpeoples drones to find and kill them
19:59:34 <Zounds_> I'll have to check it out
19:59:37 <Camail> or shoot their drone like your playing dota
19:59:53 <Zounds_> finishing some work prep and going to bed early tonight but I may try it tomorrow

20:22:32 <Golly> shadenfreude off the charts
20:24:18 <Camail> fallout 3 was good
20:24:33 <Golly> well, apart from the main quest id say
20:25:45 <Camail> the only part of the mw i disliked was that you couldnt ask the mutant to press the button at the end
20:25:55 <Camail> the most bullshit conversation ever
20:26:10 <Camail> "he bro, this WILL kill me, it is riddles with radiation, can you...can you do it?"
20:26:30 <Camail> "this isn't my journey" fuck you green man
20:26:59 <Golly> did they change that later, i seem to remember being able to do exactly that
20:28:27 <Camail> you couldnt in the vanilla game
20:28:31 <Golly> first time arund i think i played it evil and sent in someone else
20:28:42 <Camail> when they added broken steel, so that your char survives, he said he wouldnt
20:30:22 <Camail> so now you can do the smart thing, but back when the game came out they forgot about this one loophole and did a really shitty fix
