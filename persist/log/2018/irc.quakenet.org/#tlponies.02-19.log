02:01:00 <Micen|Droid> Hello 
02:01:06 <Dot`> hows all
02:01:34 <Micen|Droid> Im good, how is the backstory for the elves coming along? 
02:03:15 <Bio> they got magic, then got uppity
02:04:01 <Dot`> Bio pls, they got snooty and consieted, as was thier right
02:04:10 <Dot`> by being so much better than dorfs
02:08:52 <Bio> i c
02:16:56 <Dot`> where skrm
02:17:08 <DuB`> Forever work
02:17:12 <skrm> So my lil old VW has developed a sickness
02:17:19 <skrm> It opens all its windows at night
02:17:23 <DuB`> D:
02:17:27 <DuB`> Sounds chilly
02:17:28 <skrm> Luckily, it was snowing today
02:17:29 <Dot`> oh dear
02:17:34 <skrm> I did send you a picture mr dub
02:17:43 <DuB`> o my fon is ded
02:17:46 <skrm> dang
02:17:58 <DuB`> Will look now
02:18:20 <DuB`> Maaaan I just wanna practice moira launches now
02:18:25 <DuB`> But gotta work on this project
02:18:26 <DuB`> :(
02:18:54 <skrm> And, because it is winter, one of the windows has frozen and got detached from the mechanism so I had to dismatle the door and put it back in place
02:19:11 <DuB`> :o
02:19:14 <skrm> old cars are proper !FUN!
02:19:21 <DuB`> How capable of you
02:19:59 <Dot`> what a horse
02:20:10 <DuB`> lololol it's alllll snowy inside
02:21:03 <skrm> Im not gonna spend money to have some yokel at a garage fix my 18 year old car
02:21:25 <skrm> Its 100$+ per hour and OEM parts are hella expensive!
02:22:01 <DuB`> :T
02:26:08 <skrm> Guess ill just have to buy a new car
02:26:18 <DuB`> !
02:26:31 <skrm> What about an Alfa Romeo
02:26:31 <DuB`> Those cost even MORE money!
02:26:43 <skrm> Italian electronics are very reliable
02:26:48 <DuB`> You need Japan car
02:27:04 <DuB`> ToyoHonMaz
02:27:21 <skrm> No
02:27:24 <skrm> Nissan GTR maybe
02:27:27 <DuB`> Yes
02:27:30 <DuB`> That is my car
02:27:32 <DuB`> Someday.
02:27:34 <DuB`> A white one!
02:28:00 <DuB`> I'll live in a box and eat instant ramen for the next 10 years to save up for it.
02:28:02 <skrm> Or a Toyota GT86!
02:28:10 <skrm> GTRs are hardcore
02:28:13 <Dot`> then he would lose it in the snow
02:28:24 <DuB`> HIS doesn't have to be white
02:28:25 <skrm> They're very pretty in wine red
02:28:46 <skrm> Maybe ill just get a Datsun 240z ...
02:29:01 <DuB`> Look it goes perfect with snow https://www.nissanusa.com/dam/nissan/vehicles/sportscars/gt-r/2018/overview/key-features/2018-nissan-gtr-white-medium.jpg
02:29:29 <skrm> 5-speed manual from the 260 and some webers on that bad boi
02:30:34 <skrm> Theres a lot of kool cars made in japan
02:30:50 <skrm> too bad they all rust to death up here
02:31:07 <DuB`> :o
02:31:20 <DuB`> Maybe don't get them so wet
02:31:27 <skrm> I had a Mitsu and the floors were all rotted out and the frame had fist-sized holes in it
02:32:08 <skrm> Its the road salt and improper rust-proofing, which is odd considering they get a bunch of the white stuff in hokkaido and stuff
02:32:49 <DuB`> Haven't heard of that being specific issue with japanese cars here or anything :O
02:32:58 <DuB`> Plenty salty here too
02:33:11 <DuB`> Mebbe more there though
02:36:50 <Crisium> car nerds
02:38:46 <DuB`> Just a lil'

04:17:24 <DoB`> Been doing moira fadejump practice for like 2 hours now :P 
04:24:18 <skrm> y u do homework on a sunday anyway dob
04:25:11 <skrm> russian curler has tested positive for doping
04:25:19 <skrm> doping in curling seems quite silly
04:31:15 <Crisium> i tried fade jumping like twice
04:31:18 <Crisium> couldnt do it, gave up
04:35:09 <DoB`> Hanamura B attack ones are pretty key
04:35:24 <DoB`> Can easily get into both front windows, and up to point from under bridge area
04:38:51 <Crisium> its youself if you're with dive tanks for sure
