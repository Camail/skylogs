01:26:47 <Micen> .choose do writing, play video game
01:33:45 <Camail> Dot`  ah, oleander can combo from throws but it costs magic
01:34:04 <Camail> the magic variant of the teleport is how you convert
01:34:11 <Dot`> ah
01:39:14 <Camail> oleander has built in loops with her B fireball, look at the last master combo to see what i mean
01:39:26 <Camail> its a lot of hits but its really just two things, the ground loop and the air loop
01:41:26 <Camail> er, the B trap thing
01:41:36 <Camail> probably always want to use the C fireball in a combo for speed
01:41:54 <Dot`> woooooosh
01:41:56 <Dot`> over 
01:41:57 <Dot`> wooosh
01:46:09 <Camail> ok dirty trick for you, first of all 2 = crouching and 5 = standing
01:46:22 <Camail> numbers are directions, forward is 6, down is 2, downback is 1
01:46:53 <Camail> so a trick is doing 5C, C fireball, c trap, jump back and regain magic
01:47:05 <Camail> er no, A fireball
01:47:10 <Camail> you want the slow one
01:47:37 <Camail> this is a defensive technique because you zone with the fireball and the anti air trap, then you jump back to create space and regain the magic you just used
01:48:04 <Dot`> cunning as a fox
01:49:04 <Camail> using D while jumping seems almost universally better than using it on the ground
01:49:43 <Camail> dramatically increases evasion during your most vulnerable time
01:50:22 <Dot`> are you left handed cam?
01:50:27 <Camail> no
01:50:48 <Camail> you just git gud at using left hands for movement
01:51:03 <Camail> I would feel retarded if i tried the other way
01:51:10 <Dot`> but you dont use the attack buttons in your dominant hand?
01:51:21 <Dot`> asd is on the left of my keyboard
01:51:21 <Camail> ? i use buttons on my right, joystick on my left
01:51:33 <Dot`> oh, you have a joystick
01:51:36 <Camail> yea asd on your left, for directional movements
01:52:23 <Dot`> yea, i have asd for move and 456 on numpad for attacks
01:52:33 <Camail> well you have 4 buttons on the right
01:52:35 <Camail> abcd
01:52:45 <Camail> d is your magic button
01:52:51 <Dot`> AHHH
01:52:52 <Camail> very important for your character
01:53:12 <Dot`> i thought you meant d on the keyboard which is by default the heavy attack
01:53:24 <Camail> nah, i said earlier but you must've missed it
01:53:35 <Camail> 123456789 are directions, ABCD are attack buttons
01:53:55 <Dot`> i get it now
01:54:12 <Dot`> is 1 up and then you just go around clockwise?
01:54:14 <Camail> I used LMHS(special) earlier before i started playing and seeing what notation they use
01:54:18 <Dot`> or is one forward
01:54:23 <Camail> 1 is down back
01:54:39 <Dot`> thats ... unexpected
01:54:39 <Camail> 2 is down, 3 is down forward, 4 is back, 5 is neutral
01:54:47 <Camail> 6 forward, 7 up back, 8 up, 9 up forward
01:54:57 <Dot`> it slate for me, thats obviosly numpad
01:55:03 <Dot`> and im slow
01:55:13 <Camail> yea i personally dont like it because i prefer saying qcf instead of 236
01:55:21 <Camail> but its community determines so w/e
01:56:07 <Camail> so the notation for the string i was talking about would be 5C,236A,214C,7D
01:56:52 <Phearlock> helpful, I was wondering what people were talking about
01:57:35 <Camail> animeeeee
01:58:21 <Bio> anime
01:58:22 <Bio> ?
01:58:26 <Bio> ANIME
02:06:12 <Camail> or you can do 2C, combos into 236C for some ok damage in te neutral
02:07:43 <Camail> another dirty fucking trick that will eventually be usable: if you set up a trap directly in front of them, you can teleport behind them and push them into the trap
02:08:03 <Camail> thats gonna be rough if it ever makes a real set up
02:09:07 <Camail> oh snap, grabs give her energy
02:09:11 <Camail> magic*
02:09:26 <Camail> so she can always convert off of throws, thats good to know
02:09:47 <DuB`> nerd
02:10:19 <Camail> ur just jelly cuz you wanna play the deer
02:10:29 <Camail> I might find a bunch of tech just to spite you

06:33:43 <DuB`> Super duper fun episode
06:34:18 <DuB`> JesterNottCaleb in full form, and Taliesen found more to do too
06:44:04 <Camail> i got swept up in tfh sets
06:45:04 <Camail> velvet has some fucking destructive air normal
06:45:24 <Camail> that i literally never figured out how to beat, so i just read every time he wanted to do it and should slammed him into the ground
06:45:43 <Camail> then that set was over and another velvet wanted to play, who was significantly worse
06:46:47 <Camail> I played around 50 games tonight, good learning experience
06:49:04 <Camail> if i ever found an answer to the 9C oleander did to me I would've went 20-0
06:56:07 <DuB`> Poor pony enthusiasts getting beat up by fgc enthusiast
06:59:44 <Camail> yea man
07:00:13 <Camail> also i was worried about offense but i dont think it will be much of an issue, certainly not with paprika
07:00:22 <Camail> her resets are vicious
07:00:35 <Camail> the thing is that there's only 2 reset enders, 6A or super
07:01:23 <Camail> there are some air shenanigans but yea, its a pretty simple game on offense
07:11:18 <Camail> I've only fought a good paprika, velvet, and oleander, still need to see what the other 4 can do

16:20:35 <skram> im a lover, Dot`
16:20:47 <Dot`> you want to hug rats?
16:20:51 <skram> yeah
16:21:48 <Bio> I want true left 4 dead rat game
16:21:53 <Bio> lemme play the bad guys
16:21:54 <Runbunny> Yes Bio.
16:21:58 <Runbunny> Jonas.
16:22:40 <Zounds> The rats are way deadlier than L4D AI zombies though
16:22:51 <Dot`> all we can offer is a firy wizard bio
16:22:53 <Zounds> I think you would have to tone down the rats a bit if versus was gonna be a thing
16:24:07 <Zounds> A ratling gunner that can actually think properly would be hell
16:24:53 <Dot`> or a packamster
16:25:10 <Dot`> they hide very well in ratswarms
16:26:37 <Bio> I'll be the BOOMER
16:26:45 <Bio> summon more rats by puking on the adventurers
16:27:08 <Zounds> there's plenty of rats already thanks
16:27:33 <Dot`> im now unsure if skram wants to play ratgame or not
16:27:48 <skram> yep
16:27:54 <skram> that you are
16:28:06 <Dot`> yes.. i am unsure
16:29:19 <skram> you're not even on steam Dot`
16:29:20 <skram> come online
16:29:33 <Dot`> lies
16:30:46 <Dot`> so we have room for 1 pon still

16:43:43 <Yolteotl> took me like 2 hours to complete visa/relocation documents D:
16:43:57 <Yolteotl> they really don't want ppl to come to USA
16:52:56 <reification> was hearing yesterday how even just transferring through usa is huge pain
17:05:40 <Yolteotl> yes
17:05:55 <Yolteotl> for European countries, it is not that difficult to spend some times in USA
17:06:04 <Yolteotl> you have the ESTA to fill and that's it
17:21:39 <Bio> Time to do some adult stuff then lift

18:20:49 <Runbunny> Dot dot.
18:20:58 <Runbunny> Where do you get all these otters?
18:24:14 <Runbunny> I think I am going to play Planetside till Path of Exile is out.
18:24:24 <Dot`> imgur likes otters, i just browse through th efront page now and then
18:24:32 <Dot`> but i bet they are all from an otter reddit
18:24:48 <Runbunny> Probably yeah
18:25:00 <Runbunny> I do the same but you seem to find more otters than me.
18:25:02 <Runbunny> Which is odd.
18:25:20 <Zounds> glad you're enjoying it Runbunny 
18:25:36 <Zounds> New players so often run away in disgust after being farmed their first time playing
18:25:41 <Zounds> but you figured it out pretty good
18:25:59 <DuB`> shud i play
18:26:03 <DuB`> More shoots is good
18:26:47 <Runbunny> I played the first one and I had a general idea about how I wanted to play it, which is working out great I think.
18:27:58 <Zounds> Yeah you're that scumbag with the short scope bolt action rifle
18:28:02 <Zounds> Pretty good playstyle
18:28:08 <Zounds> Though if you get good at it everyone will hate you
18:29:13 <Zounds> If you don't have them already medkits and EMP grenades are pretty good
18:30:03 <Zounds> Though I can't remember how many certs EMP grenades cost...low priority if expensive
18:36:49 <Zounds> bloodynoob used to play planetside actually
18:36:56 <Zounds> I ran into him a few times

21:22:41 <Phearlock> How cold has it gotten at your place lately?
21:22:49 <Phearlock> Hasn't been that bad down here
21:24:07 <skram> Eh over here its only been a bit below 20 but by where i work it was about 28 or 29 at some point
21:24:21 <Phearlock> wow, we've only been down to I think -17
21:24:32 <Phearlock> Was barely below -10 today
21:25:18 <skram> We put out almost 1 GWh on the heating grid downtown yesterday
21:25:26 <skram> (fjernvarme)
21:25:50 <Phearlock> At least with all the stuff burning it'll be warm inside right? =D
21:26:08 <skram> well
21:26:10 <skram> sort of :P
21:26:23 <DuB`> Don't go in fire room pls
21:26:30 <DuB`> 3stack NA right now~
21:27:00 <skram> maybe i should just open the doors
21:27:11 <skram> warm the outsides instead of the insides
21:30:40 <Phearlock> I have a nice tiny vent to let fresh air into my room that I closed too =P
21:30:44 <Phearlock> It's a bit stuffier
21:31:01 <Phearlock> But warmer
21:31:32 <skram> im just happy to have a proper winter
21:31:43 <Phearlock> Yeah it's quite alright down here.
21:31:46 <skram> lots of snow and my face hurts sometimes
21:31:52 <skram> its pretty good
21:31:53 <Phearlock> Excuse to use all my warm shit
21:32:29 <Phearlock> If I put on my big winter jacket in like only -5C and have a T-shirt underneath I'll start to sweat if I walk around a bit =P
21:33:06 <skram> oh yeah
21:33:15 <skram> theres like 3 days a year i get to wear a scarf
21:34:40 <Bio> more if you don't care about sweating
21:35:10 <Phearlock> I can wear a scarf inside when not moving around and not sweat. That's just cozy
21:36:24 <skram> silly
21:36:32 <Phearlock> no, cozy.
21:36:54 <Bio> its SILLY cozy

21:37:48 <Bio> did you see the Zandalari druid forms
21:38:00 <Bio> DINOSAURS
21:38:02 <skram> no my man
21:38:35 <Phearlock> derpibooru.org/1593785 Please accept these scarfpons bio.
21:38:38 <Phearlock> For being so reasonable
21:38:55 <Bio> dats an oldie but a GOODIE
21:38:59 <Phearlock> yus
21:39:13 <skram> bio is this silithus thing new
21:39:19 <skram> was there a patch
21:39:23 <Bio> the pvp thing?
21:39:24 <Bio> yeah
21:39:39 <skram> and also the giant thing that sticks outta the ground
21:39:45 <Bio> oh yeah
21:39:52 <skram> why are we there again
21:39:53 <Bio> thats Sergeresaasssasses blade
21:40:03 <Bio> Sargeras
21:40:08 <skram> i already spent too much of my life grinding dragon rep in that place
21:40:11 <Bio> SURGERIOUS
21:40:27 <Bio> basically
21:40:43 <Bio> at the end of the previous raid tier, illidude opened a portal to argus
21:41:02 <Bio> that the titan sergerian used to go to azertoth
21:41:14 <skram> and he KILLED the chandelier guy
21:41:33 <Bio> but we defeated theh world soul of argus, allowing the rest of the titans to lay the smackdown on sartooth
21:41:55 <Bio> but before he was zapped back through the portal, he pulled out his bigg ass sword and stabed the planet
21:42:10 <skram> so thats what happened in that cutscene i skipped probably
21:42:12 <Bio> theres a pretty sweet cutscene
21:42:14 <Bio> yeah
21:42:41 <Bio> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1XmubgIyq4
21:42:49 <skram> and then they lowered the ilevel req for LFR right as I had big enough pants to queueueue
21:44:45 <skram> so whats the deal with the next expansion
21:45:00 <skram> why's there a battle for azeroth
21:45:04 <skram> again
21:45:59 <Bio> well, essentially, after sargeras stabbed azeroth, the "lifeblood" of the planet starts leaking out in silithus
21:46:04 <Bio> and its super powerful stuff
21:46:11 <Bio> so the factions are now fighting over it
21:46:26 <Bio> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az2u31MSJ8w
21:46:35 <skram> right
21:46:39 <skram> fuckin sylvanas probably
21:46:54 <Bio> nah, its the goblins
21:46:56 <Bio> always
21:47:05 <skram> oh yeah
21:47:15 <skram> the thing with the dinner party
21:50:33 <DuB`> How do you stab a planet
21:50:34 <DuB`> wat
21:50:40 <Bio> dub
21:50:43 <Bio> theres a video
21:50:44 <Bio> PLS
21:50:49 <skram> with a big ass sword obviously
21:50:52 <DuB`> I am busy plej
21:51:07 <Bio> sallythos is the size of a planet
21:53:58 <skram> what a soft boy king alliance is
21:55:38 <skram> v big hands too
21:56:01 <Phearlock> Who cares about the lifeblood of the planet, a huge sword stabbed it. That much mass colliding could cause an extinction event.
21:56:13 <Bio> shh shh shh
21:56:18 <Bio> no logic here
21:56:22 <Bio> only MAGIC
21:56:29 <skram> blah blah blah MAGIC SWORD
21:56:43 <Bio> https://i.redd.it/nevxps6m1ej01.jpg
21:56:50 <Bio> here's a meme for the new forms skrm
21:57:05 <skram> oh boy i love memes
21:57:23 <Phearlock> lol
21:57:39 <Phearlock> So for the first one, did trolls and raptors have babies?
21:57:45 <Phearlock> Cause that's a little disturbing and kinda hot
21:58:07 <Bio> nah, the zandalari troll druids just shapechange into those forms
21:58:28 <Phearlock> Ah
21:58:28 <Bio> travel form at the top, flying form, tank form, and spellcaster form
21:58:52 <Bio> notably missing is cat form
21:58:55 <Bio> which is for fite
21:59:24 <Phearlock> Furred raptor with cat ears.
21:59:24 <Bio> and swim form, but thats probably gonna be the same derpy sea cow that all the other druids are
21:59:33 <Phearlock> Nyan
22:02:59 <Bio> pls
22:03:53 <Camail> anyone want to play tfh? I'm also curious how we can figure out how to play together

22:10:59 <Camail> I've done it before, its not amazing, but there's a decent amount of leniency
22:11:54 <Camail> there's an EU server called cam's house of waffles
22:11:59 <Camail> that seems like a good choice

23:02:32 <Phearlock> For future reference, I'd like to learn how to stand up
23:02:36 <Camail> lul
23:02:38 <Phearlock> Without dying
23:03:34 <Camail> that slide is very unsafe
23:04:21 <Camail> also blocking on wake up is good
23:18:19 <Camail> launcher is also unsafe
23:19:38 <Phearlock> I haven't gotten out of the habit
23:21:33 <Camail> yea, its a hit confirm thing
23:30:46 <Phearlock> no idea how I hit 2 buttons there
23:30:48 <Phearlock> =D
23:31:53 <Zounds> g'night horselovers
23:32:06 <Dot`> gnight zounds
23:32:11 <Zounds> o/
23:32:14 <DuB`> NN zoonts
23:36:45 <Camail> one more
23:39:32 <Camail> GGs
23:39:33 <Phearlock> ggs <3
23:40:29 <Phearlock> Game is hard.
23:40:30 <Phearlock> But fun
23:40:53 <Camail> yea so after my super you just gotta guess
23:41:05 <Camail> i dont know any high stun combos so it wasnt that deadly, but yea it gets rough
23:41:22 <Camail> i can grab, cross up, stay on the same side, go low
23:41:43 <Camail> its just a massive set up that's pretty rough for anyone, idk if there's any other option
23:42:34 <Phearlock> I do know sorta what to work on. fucking stop making my fingers do down-strong and launcher when there's no hitconfirm. And stop dropping like 75% of the intermediate combo
23:42:52 <Phearlock> =D
23:43:31 <Phearlock> After that I will maybe learn how to use the stage 2 super, as that's apprently super good for extending combos into forever.
23:43:35 <Camail> yea the first one is probably the most important
23:43:37 <Phearlock> But that's a long ways off
23:43:52 <Phearlock> Yes =D
23:44:01 <Camail> i tried not gong too hard on the punishes because that's just boring for both of us, but gotta get that negative feedback to kick the habit
23:44:11 <Phearlock> Oh I don't mind
23:44:45 <Phearlock> And the lag was honestly not nearly as bad as I thought so that was really ncie.
23:45:08 <Camail> yea i never dropped a combo due to lag
23:45:15 <Camail> and there was no roll back that i could see
23:45:32 <Camail> this game uses save states so that if clients get out of sync due to lag, the roll back to the nearest state
23:45:38 <Camail> and i dont think i even saw any
23:45:58 <Camail> maybe one or two times where i hear a hit that was a block, but that was 30 games
23:46:56 <Phearlock> Yeah
23:47:28 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@83.251.161.94] has joined #tlponies
23:48:36 <Phearlock> Also um, if I get hit and just keep holding block, will that still work through like knockdowns or do I have to re-input at some point?
23:49:35 <Phearlock> And how fast can one start blocking while jumping, as there's a few times I tried and just got hit instantly, though I might have been slow on inputs too (probably this lol).
23:53:50 <DuB`> Oh, I actually have some dollars left after rent! Pizza friday maybe :D
23:54:06 <Phearlock> Pizza =D
23:54:24 <DuB`> OWL starting now too, perfect timing
23:54:25 <DuB`> GOGO
23:54:53 <Dot`> hoof fightign > pizza
23:55:28 <DuB`> But hoof fighting costs as much as TWO pizzas!
23:55:44 <Dot`> that does make it tricky
23:58:45 <Camail> so you can hold block and it will always block
23:58:58 <skram> DuB` the answer is always pizza ok
23:59:11 <Phearlock> ok!
23:59:18 <Camail> there are some frames of your jump where you cant block, also going from holding forward to holding back takes a fraction of a second where you might get hit
23:59:51 <Phearlock> I wonder if I can block while flying
