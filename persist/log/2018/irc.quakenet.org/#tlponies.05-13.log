09:31:11 <Dot`> Hey cane <3
09:31:15 <Dot`> hows it going?
09:31:43 <Cane> Having a good morning? Mine's great because I can watch cars.
09:32:18 <Dot`> i was up late playing Titan Quest with brother
09:32:21 <Dot`> only just got up
09:32:33 <Dot`> time zones are a basstard
09:32:44 <Cane> Hah they are.
09:33:23 <Dot`> but i do find it amazing still we can game when he lives on the opposite side of the planet with minimal lag
09:35:18 <Cane> I used to play things like SubSpace against all kinds of people across the world, back in '99, and that - at the time - felt relatively lag free.
09:35:38 <Cane> It's only gotten so much better since then.
09:35:52 <Dot`> south africa didnt really have internet in 99

10:00:45 <Phearlock> morning
10:05:06 <Cane> Blah. I was excited for the end of this race and now, with ~3 hours to go, the red flag was thrown because of massive fog.
10:05:09 <Cane> Hopefully it clears up.

13:28:14 <Cane> DuB`!
13:28:21 <Cane> You missed the outs!
13:28:27 <DuB`> T_T
13:28:36 <DuB`> Waking up at 7am on sunday is hard!
13:28:46 <Cane> In Nurburgring they had to stop because of fog.
13:28:54 <DuB`> lolol
13:29:05 <Cane> Came back, lined up, started, but unfortunately AMG lost its 20+ second lead at that point.
13:29:16 <Cane> So Porsche were able to stay on their butts and pass them in dramatic fashion.
13:29:19 <Cane> There was contact and everything.
13:29:33 <Cane> AMG spun 90 degrees but held it, then ALMOST came back, but not quite.
13:29:38 <Cane> So now Porsche are winning that.
13:29:49 <Cane> AND THEN you missed the start of F1 where debris is currently being sweeped away from the track.
13:30:01 <Cane> Need a stream? Found one that works.
13:30:17 <DuB`> Sure, as backup
13:30:31 <Cane> Where are you watching it? =)
13:30:34 <Cane> http://mygoodstream.pw/espn/espn2.html
13:30:49 <Cane> http://acesports.pw/f1.html should also work.
13:31:19 <Cane> Porsche wins, AMG GT3 second place.
13:31:34 <Cane> Aston Martin almost got 3rd. Close call, hell of a fight for 3rd place.
13:32:08 <DuB`> weow
13:32:31 <Dot> i am home
13:32:32 <DuB`> Nice to see so many makes fighting for the top all race, that's really all ya can ask for.
13:32:33 <Dot> hows all
13:32:39 <DuB`> Dot Dot
13:32:45 <Dot> Dub dub
13:33:45 <DuB`> Both RedBull drivers in their usual place - making ferrari and mercedes feel the heat :P
13:33:47 <Cane> Yeah, it's not just one model, top 6 is pretty solid.
13:33:54 <Cane> lol yup.
13:34:41 <Cane> Have to say I like the HUD overlay. One good thing to come out of this silly new metal frame. =)
13:36:34 <DuB`> Dot Dot
13:36:43 <Dot> Dub Dub
13:36:44 <DuB`> What level was everyone at the end of your campaign?
13:37:05 <Dot> 6
13:37:42 <Dot> because i cant count experience right i found out
13:37:51 <DuB`> !!
13:38:04 <Dot> the adjusted XP for more enemies is only for calculating CR
13:38:08 <Dot> not for giving
13:39:24 <DuB`> Was thinking about it last night, I've never gotten to play a character past lv3
13:39:34 <DuB`> Hopefully akhat doesn't meet the same fate...
13:39:42 <Dot> yea, most of mine have ended at 3, halvs went to 5
13:39:55 <Dot> but i did lose my original character in that at lvl 2
13:48:22 <Dot> we just have to believe in the Bio Dub
13:51:50 <DuB`> VER!
13:51:57 <DuB`> WOOO
13:52:07 <DuB`> Ah, borken ferrari
13:54:02 <Zounds> DuB` you wanna qp or anything
13:54:10 <Zounds> assuming you're able to watch F1 at the same time
13:54:45 <DuB`> Just gonna watch
13:55:33 <Zounds> kk
13:56:28 <Cane> Verstappen, really good stuff.
13:57:29 <Cane> Holy.
13:57:30 <Cane> Balls.
13:57:36 <DuB`> CLENCH
13:57:52 <Cane> That was a diamond clench right there.
13:58:10 <Cane> LOL they were like centimeters away from each other at that point, holy...
14:00:51 <DuB`> RB might fall straight to 6-7 after stop, hope they can gain more position before then.
14:01:02 <Cane> Oh man that's just awful.
14:01:14 <Cane> In a sport where pit stops are 2.5 seconds, 30 seconds is a goddamned lifetime.
14:01:19 <DuB`> Some INSIDE the tire???
14:01:35 <DuB`> Bizarre
14:01:46 <Cane> I have NO IDEA what the problem could have been.
14:07:58 <DuB`> If nothing else changes, one RB podium seems likely
14:08:15 <DuB`> BOT will either have to pit or struggle with his tire a lot near the end
14:08:44 <carcinisation> our open div match went to final round on tiebreaker; i'm exhausted
14:10:01 <DuB`> gg reif
14:14:01 <DuB`> OH BOY
14:14:18 <Dot> did you win?
14:14:32 <DuB`> Safety Car could hand two podium spots to RB on a platter
14:18:06 <DuB`> NO T_T
14:18:11 <Cane> Bloody hell..
14:18:32 <Cane> That's gonna take a while to fix. =/
14:29:06 <DuB`> LOL
14:29:28 <DuB`> Who needs 1/4 of my front wing, anyway!
14:30:24 <DuB`> Gaining on a Merc and maintaining gap in front of VET ferrari with a chuck of car missing, fantastic
14:30:33 <DuB`> chunk*
14:40:17 <Cane> I'm still surprised and excited about Red Bull becoming such a big player in racing.
14:41:12 <Cane> "Wait, a banner at Formula One costs HOW MUCH? You could buy a Formula One CAR for that much!" - Red Bull, probably
14:43:46 <carcinisation> yes dot we won :D
14:43:51 <DuB`> My strims are dying :(
14:44:19 <carcinisation> don't let your strims be drims
14:44:24 <Cane> Yep, all strims ded.
14:46:05 <Cane> Found one http://www.easysport.tv/games/formula/
14:47:24 <Cane> Sigh, ads.

17:28:11 <Cane> Watched the end of it.
17:28:24 <Cane> They had to stop it due to heavy fog, which really buggered the top of the list.
17:29:03 <skrm> oh dang
17:29:11 <Cane> When they resumed the race, the lead between AMG and Porsche (20+ seconds?) was negated entirely.
17:29:16 <Cane> Porsche just stayed in AMG's slipstream and ended up winning.
17:29:27 <Cane> It was dramatic for a good 10 minutes though.
17:29:58 <skrm> Porsche won? What results am I looking at then haha
17:30:36 <Cane> https://livetiming.azurewebsites.net/events/20/results
