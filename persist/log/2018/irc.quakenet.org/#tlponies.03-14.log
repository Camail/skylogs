00:01:52 <skram> okay take it down this, DuB`: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-LCVjCVbGc
00:02:08 <Dot> skram is a mad lad
00:02:17 <skram> i know you dont like soft acoustic stuff but this is very good
00:02:58 <skram> DuB`: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwNGR792Ifk
00:03:02 <skram> if you want to feel ill
00:03:24 <DuB`> It is good
00:03:34 <DuB`> And I do not want to feel ill but will partake regardless.
00:03:50 <DuB`> Oh GOSH
00:04:13 <skram> fuck this is good
00:04:37 <DuB`> ...
00:04:55 <Camail> i agree, this is a proper version of the song
00:04:56 <skram> this guy has a lot of this stuff
00:05:02 <DuB`> This is still my favorite birb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRsfOGJ5lZg
00:05:09 <DuB`> Also reflects how I feel about that Africa
00:05:34 <Camail> dub you have a scream cup too!?
00:05:40 <DuB`> AAAAAAAAH
00:05:41 <Runbunny> Hahaha why is that so funny
00:05:45 <Camail> it's where i keep my anger
00:05:51 <skram> very reminiscent of me and my box of jeltzin vodka at my graduation party, camail.
00:05:54 <DuB`> Also one that I growl/mumble into https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDCX4TIu1xw
00:06:45 <Camail> i understand the desire to scream in a cup, feeling vibrations is pleasant
00:06:50 <Dot> DUB
00:06:53 <Dot> what you got against africa
00:06:53 <DuB`> DOT
00:06:57 <Dot> OI
00:06:57 <skram> having a bird seems very stressful
00:07:04 <DuB`> Did you listen to it, Dot??
00:07:12 <skram> Well clearly he would not bless the rains down in africa
00:07:45 <skram> he was like no when an old man stopped him along the way
00:07:57 <Camail> dub is so rude to old people
00:08:19 <DuB`> I don't even have any wild dogs to let cry out in the night.
00:08:20 <Runbunny> skram, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0HCZ4YGqbw
00:08:20 <skram> maybe he didnt want to cure whats deep inside
00:08:31 <skram> and not at all frightened by this thing that he's become

03:55:55 <Camail> good run, not too sad about this one. considering the trials he went through
03:56:54 <DuB`> Yeah, dunno the exact effects of his body issues but I assume that making it to 76 isn't a bad scenario
03:57:15 <Camail> his musculature was nearly completely atrophied
03:57:37 <Camail> its kind of a miracle he didn't die in his 20's

15:26:25 <Micen> I will OW after dnd
15:27:36 <Zounds> Imagine a DnD game with the mane6 and spike
15:28:00 <Zounds> we saw a glimpse of it with Discords magix but a proper game would be entertaining to see
15:28:53 <DuB_phone> 2x nerd
15:30:37 <Micen> Twilight would be the rules lawyer, RD woudl be a min-maxer, rarity would be a roleplayer, Fluttershy would be the one who isnt into it at first but then once started is hooked, Pinkie Would be the one who always brings the CN character to the table, and AJ would wait to hear what others are playing to decide on what she was doing. and Spike forever dm.
15:32:00 <DuB_phone> Nice

21:47:38 <Bio> the update was to a black screen
21:47:41 <Bio> obviously
21:48:46 <Runbunny> That would explain a few things.
