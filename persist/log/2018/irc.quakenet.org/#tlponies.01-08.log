02:32:19 <Camail> DuB`  pvp went better than i expected, basically anyone other than the 285 guys had trouble dealing with the big boy shield
02:34:23 <DuB`> Noice
03:16:55 <Camail> the AoT game is pretty fun
03:17:58 <Camail> you can tell the muso devs made it because the overall structure of the missions is the same as muso games, but the actual gameplay is so different

23:31:33 <Dot`> good timing phear
23:32:46 <Phearlock> evening poners
23:33:11 <Phearlock> What timing would that be dot?
23:33:39 <Phearlock> oh
23:34:29 <Phearlock> Edgepon <3
23:37:20 <Phearlock> Everspace is a fun game, didn't think much of it from just looking at the trailers and random review/quick look vids.
23:38:24 <Phearlock> But the way it's just tight controlling space flying fun + the pressure of trying not to die due it being run based turns out to be pretty amazing.
23:38:35 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
23:39:41 <Dot`> how long isa run genrally?

23:40:10 <Phearlock> There's an achivement for managing it in under an hour.
23:40:21 <Phearlock> I haven't beat it yet though
23:40:31 <Phearlock> Typically die about 2 hours in =P
23:40:42 <Phearlock> Plenty of nice stopping points though
23:41:21 <Dot`> hmm, may pick it up next sale
23:41:44 <Dot`> i like space, and shooting
23:41:48 <Phearlock> yeah I grabbed it this sale
23:42:18 <Phearlock> It has fancy joystick/tackIR/VR support but I'm just playing mouse+keyboard as it seems to have been really designed for that.
23:43:10 <Phearlock> Of the 9 runs I've done so far, only 1 I feel has been due to bullshit and the rest have been just me not playing well enough.
23:46:23 <Runbunny> Space.
23:46:37 <Runbunny> My roommate played it. but I never got around to try it :/
23:47:08 <Dot`> phear, what was the name of that other space game, wasnt on steam
23:47:20 <Phearlock> Starsector
23:47:36 <Phearlock> Which I would recommend even higher but maybe I'm biased xD
23:48:03 <Dot`> i wanted to ask how that game is going, because its still early access right?
23:49:48 <Phearlock> There's still stuff being added. Next patch will overhaul the economy (for the third? time) and add colonization/planet management.
23:50:06 <Dot`> cool, sound slike its progressing well
23:50:53 <Phearlock> The combat portion is wonderfully fleshed out, last patch added exploration as a playstyle and overhauled carriers/fighters
23:51:01 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
23:51:05 <Phearlock> Mods etc still going good
23:51:16 <Dot`> EXPLOSIONS
23:52:10 <Runbunny> I think I saw some gameplay of that.
23:52:43 <Runbunny> Have you tried Avorion Phearlock?
23:53:20 <Phearlock> Yup!
23:53:54 <Phearlock> Pretty good, lovely building system in terms of cosmetics. Needs some work on AI and economy
23:56:05 <Phearlock> Would still recommend avorion if you find it on sale and/or want to build your own spaceships.
23:56:38 <Phearlock> Like most building games though, takes a lot of your time if you want to make something really fancy.
23:57:23 <Runbunny> Yeah I have some stuff.
23:58:49 <Dot`> you have time stuff runbun?
