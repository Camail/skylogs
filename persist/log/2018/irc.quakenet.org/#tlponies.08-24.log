06:51:55 <Dot`_> hmm
06:59:14 <Camail> dot the new hollow knight dlc is meh =/
07:00:29 <Camail> i did path of pain on day of release, but my hype has rapidly waned for what they've offered at the start of this dlc
07:01:38 <DoT`> aww
07:08:56 <Camail> a massive amount of reused assets with a few new things buried in there, but it is largely nothing new
07:09:45 <Camail> i might eventually do it, but they really gave me no reason to
07:10:07 <Camail> path of pain was fascinating because it was a secret in the white palace, a place already really cool and shrouded in mystery and lore
07:10:32 <Camail> this new thing is basically like a lackluster version of that
07:12:02 <DoT`> that sucks
07:12:19 <DoT`> was hoping they saved thier best for the final DLC

19:30:36 <BioPone> So long as liquid doesn't get too far behind, they should be good for the mid game. Super late is scary vs pl
19:31:38 <BioPone> Mid game to late mid game is their ideal window
19:32:06 <BioPone> After the early chen and pugna stuff, but before pl comes online
19:33:32 <BioPone> Secret are rough on stuns
19:33:42 <BioPone> Only 2, long cds

19:34:10 <skram> yarr
19:34:15 <skram> mk late is p scary too
19:34:19 <BioPone> May mean liquid can get another item before bkbs

19:34:46 <BioPone> He's only not scary when he gets shot down early in lane

19:35:15 <BioPone> It's hard for him to catch up because cleave is really bad atm
