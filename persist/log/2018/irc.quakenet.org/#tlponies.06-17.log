00:59:47 <Dot> why no sleep skram
00:59:58 <skrma> too early
01:00:02 <skrma> sun hasnt risen yet
01:01:55 <Cane> skrma, I can give you some onboards. The calming sounds of a high performance hybrid engine should lull you to sleep.
01:02:07 <skrma> please cane
01:02:09 <skrma> sounds perfect
01:02:37 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JIAeEBt15Q <- #7, current leader
01:02:51 <skrma> toyota huh
01:02:52 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKR2ax54op4 <- Ford GT with commentary
01:02:54 <skrma> no surprises there
01:03:12 <Cane> There's also #8 who's in 2nd place.
01:03:17 <Cane> So you know, take your pick.
01:03:51 <skrma> was hoping to se the rebellion r13s on the podium
01:05:41 <Cane> Same.
01:06:19 <Cane> I thought Rebellion had an onboard.
01:06:21 <Cane> They did for qualifying.
01:15:34 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kdXLrCHQyU Rebellion, found it, bloody hell.
01:16:08 <skrma> my hat off to your substantial pirate stream finding skills
01:16:49 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYFPp3i-5BM is Toyota #8, Alonso's car.
01:17:15 <Cane> Bad sound though.
01:17:46 <Cane> Here's an interesting one.
01:17:47 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4meLujYKWag
01:18:06 <skrma> very tranquil
01:18:28 <Cane> What it says on the tin. It's the footage the commentators see and use, but there's no commentary.
01:18:30 <Cane> Just sounds.
01:19:58 <Cane> Apparently their legal team has been hard at work cracking down on pirate streams. Most of them have been taken down. Gotta get Ace Streamer if you want the Eurosport footage for now.
01:20:13 <Cane> I just watch the no comms + my onboard of choice usually.
01:21:15 <skrma> whats it look like in the GTE class
01:21:18 <skrma> porsche in the lead?
01:21:37 <Cane> https://www.lemans.org/fr/24-heures-du-mans
01:21:54 <Cane> Scroll down and click on Classement Complet
01:22:13 <skrma> oh nice
01:22:13 <Cane> But yes, Porsche is killing it.
01:22:20 <Cane> In both GTE categories.
01:22:33 <DuB`> Aha!
01:22:36 <skrma> as they have been the last 4 or 5 years :p
01:22:45 <skrma> ford gt in 3rd though!
01:22:47 <DuB`> Cane, those darned legal teams
01:22:59 <DuB`> Explains why I couldn't find a single stream earlier :P
01:23:16 <Cane> Haha yeah they're playing whack-a-mole for this event.
01:24:28 <DuB`> "And now down to our man in the pit." "Yeah, they've got--" VROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM "...they've got.."
01:24:33 <Cane> LOL
01:24:57 <skrma> BRRRRAAAAP
01:25:40 <skrma> that red lighting by the side air scoops look really cool though
01:26:03 <DuB`> Yeah, pretty fords
01:26:08 <DuB`> MMMM LMP1 tho
01:26:46 <Cane> Yeah, but Toyota needs to hiccup for everyone else to have a chance I think.
01:26:52 <skrma> yeah the lmp1s are really good looking
01:27:11 <skrma> i like the dorsal fin looking thing in the middle
01:28:37 <DuB`> Audi badly missed
01:28:40 <DuB`> tears
01:29:04 <skrma> Audi, porsche ...
01:29:16 <skrma> mercedes!
01:32:55 <Cane> I always hope to see a Mercedes AMG at the very least.
01:33:08 <Cane> I loved watching Black Falcon's at Nurburgring.
01:33:12 <Cane> Alas.
01:33:53 <skrma> heck yeah
01:34:31 <skrma> I just wish they had better looking liveries
01:34:35 <skrma> or none at all
01:34:45 <skrma> matte black
01:35:08 <Cane> God damn that's a thought. <3
01:37:45 <Cane> The Rebellion onboard has a dead pixel and I CANNOT UNSEE IT.
01:38:10 <skrma> ach why would you even mention that
01:38:11 <skrma> :p
01:38:23 <Cane> Because if I have to suffer I'm taking you all down with me!

06:31:30 <ZK> ok!
06:36:12 <ZK> damnit. 20gb, my laptop only has 14 gb. Hmmm, what can i delete...
06:40:47 <Camail> well before you DL it, its a monster hunter game
06:40:51 <Camail> so if you dont like those, then dont play
06:41:12 <Camail> but it's quite fun, hunts are only 10-15 minutes long
06:43:06 <ZK> never played monster hunter, but from what i see the combat is souls like which is fun!

12:28:53 <Dot`> runbun this is a good ferret
12:29:59 <Runbunny> One of the best.
12:38:43 <Dot`> what you upto today runbun
12:40:53 <Runbunny> Video games. I think
12:40:59 <Dot`> good choice
12:41:12 <Runbunny> I have to go to the hospital as well, to make sure my cells don't die.
12:41:29 <Dot`> that would be bad
12:41:36 <Dot`> and you would have to harvest MORE blood
12:41:52 <Runbunny> I have to anyways.
12:42:29 <Runbunny> But these aren't actual blood cells, they just kinda look and act like B-cells. but really they're just cancer cells.
12:43:23 <Dot`> Runbun doesnt want cancer cells to die
12:43:26 <Dot`> the monster
12:43:38 <Runbunny> I need them!
12:44:15 <Runbunny> Because no one will let me experiment on stem cells. So I have take what I can get.
