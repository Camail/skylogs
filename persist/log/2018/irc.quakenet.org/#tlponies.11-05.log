01:39:52 <Runbunny> The best damn snail / ghost that broke my heart in pieces. 
01:40:11 <DuB`> I've still only seen like half of monogatari
01:40:14 <skram> that doesnt explain...anything?
01:40:14 <DuB`> I oughta do that
01:40:20 <Runbunny> Yes Dub.
01:40:25 <reification> stuttering snail
01:40:35 <Runbunny> She will bite your tongue.
01:41:06 <skram> lewd
01:41:11 <skram> tell me more about snail lady
01:42:06 <Runbunny> reification, I had a social event that I had to attend the day I watched the episode. I was up early so I figured I'd pass time with anime. That was a horrible day.
01:42:22 <Runbunny> Let me link you the introduction scene.
01:43:55 <Runbunny> skram, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1kBXNrXduo
01:45:43 <reification> rewatching that is like with fight club runbun
01:48:14 <Runbunny> Indeed.
01:49:07 <Runbunny> Imagine watching that from Senjougahara's perspective.
01:49:12 <skram> i dont get it
01:49:31 <Runbunny> She is lost Skram!
01:49:49 <skram> yes

01:55:34 <Runbunny> Yes Reif.
01:55:42 <reification> i'm afraid that would require watching the whole thing (which you should skram)
01:56:19 <Runbunny> I think it would be easier to get Bio to watch anime than Skram.
01:57:08 <skram> me an' dub watched magic loli hitler at some point
01:57:18 <Crisium> nani the fuck
01:57:54 <Runbunny> Ohh I still need to watch Tanya.

01:58:39 <DuB`> Magical Loli Hitler is great.
02:00:05 <Runbunny> When is next monogatari :/
02:00:25 <Runbunny> I think there is still a movie I haven't seen.

09:27:41 <DoT|Phone> I thought you died
09:27:53 <skram> naw
09:28:14 <skram> apparantly there was to be an electrical inspection this morning and the lady who owns the house nglected to tell me
09:28:29 <skram> i wasnt planning to wake up for hours
09:29:08 <DoT|Phone> oh dear
09:34:25 <DoT|Phone> you see what I said about Bog Luck?
09:35:05 <skram> yeah
09:35:16 <skram> dont know if he is a naughty boi though??
09:35:32 <DoT|Phone> he has a cultist blade
09:35:49 <DoT|Phone> and is working with lizardmen
09:36:05 <skram> wait when did we see his cultist blade
09:36:08 <DoT|Phone> and is on Ahkats list
09:36:25 <DoT|Phone> we did. he wears it openly
09:36:39 <skram> somehow i missed that
09:37:06 <skram> do we know how many cultists there are in that place
09:37:43 <DoT|Phone> nope. but we either quickly sneak into his room and try hit him all at once while he sleeps
09:38:07 <DoT|Phone> or lure him into the storeroom and try kill him before he wakes anyone else
09:38:16 <skram> think thats the best option
09:38:21 <skram> ardred might be anger though``
09:38:33 <DoT|Phone> we blame the lizards
09:39:01 <skram> yeah i see now way that could go wrong
09:39:02 <skram> :p
09:39:16 <DoT|Phone> or say we came upon him dealing with them and they attacked us
09:39:43 <DoT|Phone> we are not going to stick around to answer questions
09:39:51 <DoT|Phone> Going to kill Bog
09:40:15 <DoT|Phone> wake ardred and give a 30 second explanation
09:40:29 <DoT|Phone> claim one of the lizards got away down the tunnel
09:40:43 <DoT|Phone> and we are going after him before he can bring more
09:41:04 <DoT|Phone> then run before questions are asked
09:41:18 <DoT|Phone> that's my idea for a plan
09:41:55 <skram> i dig it
09:42:02 <skram> running away from awkward conversations
09:42:53 <DoT|Phone> bog is on ahkats list so I don't think we can leave him alive
09:48:54 <skram> dub needs to fix his character sheet
09:49:43 <DoT|Phone> yes. but when your stats are that good you can afford to forget things
09:54:06 <skram> fair
09:54:12 <skram> anyway i have to go into town
09:54:13 <skram> see ya
