09:10:56 <Camail> .tell reification got to act 4 asc9 on defect... the last boss thoroughly fucked me in two turns...
09:11:46 <Camail> i dont know what kind of deck beats sts
09:12:10 <DoT|Phone1> git gud?
09:12:13 <Camail> really only the best possible decks, and even among those only a specific slice of those
09:12:39 <DoT|Phone1> meta decks
09:13:02 <Camail> this boss is anti infinite
09:13:29 <Camail> the only infinites that work are those who scale REALLY fast and also let you  survive at least 3 turns
09:13:35 <Camail> because there is a damage cap per turn
09:13:42 <Camail> and each card plays hurts you
09:14:41 <Camail> i could see a really really strong power deck on defect working, if you can get buffers and a lot of broken defense loops going
09:17:36 <Camail> wait no i think infinites work, it just caps max damage per hit?
09:23:29 <DoT|Phone1> glad I could help
09:34:59 <Camail> still, i think i've only built 1 or 2 decks in my 200+ hours of this game that would confidently beat this dude

21:48:29 <Camail> so in rimworld my first married couple has had an entire soap opera happen in the span of 4 years
21:48:59 <Camail> she cheated on him, then her wedding finger got bitten off by an animal
21:49:14 <Camail> specifically just her ring finger on her left hand, no other damage
21:49:45 <Camail> symbolism can be painful
21:50:54 <DuB`> Haha
21:51:05 <Camail> oh, brb getting raided by 30 pigs
21:51:21 <Camail> i was running out of meat, too

21:55:41 <Camail> ok that was a thing
21:56:40 <Camail> but yea, so she has an affair and gets her hand all fucked up, she gets dumped and is immediately back her husband
21:56:52 <Camail> only to start an affair with someone else the NEXT week
21:57:33 <Camail> this new guy is a body purist and by now she's the only person who has all her original body parts, sans finger
21:57:56 <Dot> give her a mechanical finger
21:57:58 <Camail> they stay together for like, a full year? and everything is great, but then SHE breaks that off
21:57:59 <Dot> ruin her life
21:58:15 <Camail> at which point i find it fitting to give her a bionic arm
21:58:30 <Camail> so she has her ring finger back, and also her marriage
21:58:36 <Camail> she's been faithful ever since
21:58:46 <DuB`> lulul
21:58:49 <Camail> her and her ex lover hate each other obviously
21:59:31 <Camail> i also gave him bionics because my colony is rich enough to where the existential crisis can be smothered in fine dining and cushy pillows
22:00:50 <DuB`> Metal > meat
22:00:55 <Camail> her journey has been fascinating, from a do-nothing domestic stereotype to a literal world class genius
22:01:02 <Camail> yea transhumanism is great in this game
22:01:26 <Camail> its also a personality trait, where a person can be made increasingly happy the less real body parts they have
22:01:57 <Camail> unfortunately the only pawn i have that has transhumanist is also non-violent so she never has any torn off digits that warrant a bionic
22:04:59 <DuB`> That can be remedied...
22:06:51 <Dot> cam you need to play more dorf fort to learn how to help ppl overcome these kind of challanges
22:07:08 <Dot> for instance, they may happen to get locked outside with wild dogs
22:07:12 <Dot> wouldnt that be aweful?
22:07:25 <Camail> i can give them limbs any time
22:07:35 <skram> ugh guess its time to expand the tomb AGAIN
22:07:52 <Camail> they dont need to be torn to shreds, it lets you rip them off cleanly
22:07:55 <Dot> the tomb is always a mega project skram
22:08:01 <Camail> it's just really expensive to give ppl bionics
22:08:03 <Dot> cam pls
22:08:04 <DuB`> Gotta engrave the tombs, so they'll be HAPPY to occupy them!
22:08:10 <Dot> thats not a thing
22:08:14 <Dot> they must be torn off
22:08:32 <skram> the engraving depicts a dwarf on fire
22:08:38 <skram> being eaten by an elephant that is also on fire
22:08:39 <Dot> only through surviving trauma do they prove themselves worthy
22:08:41 <Camail> ok so, i had a guy with one eye go on a caravan
22:08:58 <Camail> while he was away i was making 2 bionic eyes, one for him and one for another guy
22:09:03 <Camail> i tihnk it was the guy making the eyes
22:09:11 <Camail> during the trip he loses his SECOND eye
22:09:24 <Dot> skram, i need to read Boatmurdered again
22:09:25 <Camail> and has to go 2 weeks blindly wandering with his friends back to town
22:09:41 <skram> Dot: i thought the same thing
22:09:45 <skram> and i am currently doing it haha
22:10:09 <Camail> i felt bad for him, when he got back i gave him both bionic eyes, so he went from blind to seeing the matrix, and the guy who amde the eyes got shafted
22:10:11 <DuB`> Good ol' good ol' boatmurdered
22:10:26 <DuB`> Haha Cam
22:10:29 <DuB`> I SEE EVERYTHING
22:10:35 <Camail> entirely too much
22:10:51 <Camail> there's still one level of tech higher than bionic, but its uncraftable and has to be found
22:11:04 <Camail> but yea, like from blackness to having a HUD
