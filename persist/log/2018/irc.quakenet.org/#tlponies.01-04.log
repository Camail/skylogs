01:36:33 <Crisium> one loss included raqe quitter after losing first point
01:41:50 <Camail> whew
01:42:09 <Camail> gonna be a long time until i play the division as much as i did today
01:42:14 <Camail> that was like 6 hours straight
01:44:04 <Dot`> it was good, im a bit dissapointed in how few ppl are in th DZ
01:44:13 <Dot`> but weekend may bring more
01:46:27 <Dot`> or maybe its all happening at lvl 30
01:49:52 <Camail> you saw how easy it is to get to 30, most people are there already
01:50:01 <Camail> i could've been 30 like 5 days ago
01:53:05 <Camail> also it was super late weekday night on euro server
01:57:22 <Camail> dot go to sleep
01:57:28 <Camail> dream of golden weapons, hundreds

02:28:52 <DuB`> Woo lv30
02:28:58 <DuB`> Gear score, incursions, world tiers!
02:33:29 <Camail> I'm gonna do some missions to get to 30, i guess
02:33:45 <Camail> had a decent break, will get 30 then be super extra done
02:33:54 <Camail> how much does DZ stuff cost now
02:34:04 <Camail> well more importantly dub, exotics
02:34:07 <Camail> big dawg
02:34:13 <Camail> aka The Hound
02:34:17 <Camail> aka Yarp
02:34:24 <skram> THREE DAWG
02:34:50 <DuB`> Uh
02:34:53 <DuB`> 100 pheonix tokens
02:35:07 <skram> pretty sure this is you cam https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOsck7jYUsE
02:35:18 <Camail> yes I've seen the meme
02:35:42 <skram> i forget you're a memelord
02:36:04 <Camail> no thats bio
02:36:23 <Camail> but that particular one has been quite funny
02:38:34 <Bio> DID SOMEONE SAY MEME
03:08:22 <Crisium> oh another loss with silver damage and elim healer
03:08:30 <Crisium> makes sense that i take full responsibility
03:09:40 <Crisium> a healer should outdamage 1 dps and 2 tanks
03:11:09 <Camail> rip, my gear score is 85
03:11:10 <Camail> so low
03:11:17 <DuB`> Yeah haha
03:12:37 <Camail> 285 is the top of the scale, i think
03:12:51 <DuB`> we gon get rekt
03:13:51 <Camail> dont plan on doing pvp for awhile
03:13:57 <Camail> there's a shit ton of stuff to do once you hit 30

03:45:24 <Crisium> everyone is terrible at ow
03:46:11 <Crisium> like 1/5 games i dont have peak SR on my team
03:46:19 <Crisium> but iv been sucked into ELO gell
03:46:24 <Crisium> im sure Skram knows
03:46:31 <Camail> DuB`  mannnnn the m44 we use is only lvl 44, but ther's a strictly sorse version from the dz weapons vendor thats 170
03:46:40 <skram> skram knows all about that shit, cris
03:46:41 <Camail> worse*
03:46:53 <Crisium> your skill, as a measurable and determinant factor, is virtually irrelvant towrds win or less.  you could afk and still get the same w/l
03:47:05 <DuB`> Weird, cam.
03:47:09 <Crisium> might as well just not play
03:47:18 <Camail> its more dps but it doesnt have determined
03:47:19 <Crisium> id get banned eventually, but id have the same SR
03:47:21 <Camail> so no crits
03:47:32 <skram> probably
03:47:41 <DuB`> I did see some of the exotic weapons looked kinda lackluster... until I saw their 3rd passives
03:47:46 <Camail> I bought it...but honestly i am thinking about not using it until i can roll determined onto it
03:48:01 <skram> it doesnt matter if you did fucking well if you lost
03:48:07 <Camail> yea top level gear just has extra mechanics
03:48:18 <Crisium> especially now, where skill based SR was removed for diamond and above
03:48:33 <skram> >_<
03:48:37 <Crisium> you could get 4 Gold and Lose, then get 0 medals and win, and end up even
03:48:41 <Crisium> thx bliz
03:48:55 <skram> good luck getting 5 illiterate cunts to cooperate
03:49:14 <DuB`> This is why you play quickplay and arcade.
03:49:26 <DuB`> Or warframe!
03:49:28 <Crisium> quickplay is a waste of time if you dont play healer
03:49:39 <Crisium> 4 dps 1 tank 1 healer if you are lucky
03:49:48 <Crisium> if you pick dps tho, expect 5 dps 1 tank
03:49:54 <skram> no thats why you play comp until you hate yourself
03:50:09 <Crisium> i dont hate me
03:50:21 <Crisium> i hate them
03:50:30 <Crisium> tho i do have the occasionally ass game
03:51:23 <Crisium> its just weird that when i play healer i outdamage tanks, but when i play tanks i outdamage dps
03:51:29 <Crisium> dont know what the fuck to do
03:51:41 <Crisium> because i know i heale rmore / block more too when i do that
03:51:53 <Crisium> might as well alt+f4
03:52:32 <Crisium> 3979SR peak stuck at 3200 hell
03:52:41 <Crisium> and skram is 4000 peak stuck around there too
03:52:48 <Crisium> hell is real, it is in this game
03:56:26 <skram> i should've been a dps person
03:56:59 <skram> even if i heal like a fucking god it doesnt matter if your shitty ass teammates hide behind fucking everything and die
04:01:43 <Camail> DuB`  santa crew keeps inviting me and i just wanted to get to 30 and dip...
04:01:58 <Camail> I'm flattered but like...tomorrow man
04:02:38 <Camail> the phoenix credit costs seem kinda nuts
04:02:48 <Camail> i dunno how I'm gonna do when we really hit the grind wall

04:53:13 <Bio> pls
05:11:36 <Camail> also the DZ brackets off by ilvl
05:11:40 <Camail> which is useful to know
05:11:46 <Camail> so maybe we dont have to cower in fear
05:11:59 <Camail> we can still do supply drop runs and other events
05:12:18 <Camail> but honestly i have 0 desire to do any random running around unless its in dz6+
05:21:08 <Camail> DuB`  wanna try an incursion?
05:22:26 <Camail> hmm
05:22:31 <Camail> maybe incursion are only tier 2

10:16:57 <Camail> honestly dont do a whole lot more damage, only like 50%
10:17:22 <Dot`> nice
10:19:59 <Camail> its really quite easy to get to 200+, i wonder when the real grind happens
10:20:09 <Camail> haven't even done any of the dlc end game stuff
10:28:49 <Camail> also dot a great way to get free items is buy grabbing intel, you get 110k xp so you only need to get 4 to get a cache
10:31:20 <Dot`> hmmm, good to know
10:36:19 <Camail> like, you get higher level gear than your own area
10:36:45 <Camail> I'm in the 205-230 area and just got 235 stuff from the cache
10:50:15 <Dot`> cool, will check it out later
10:50:18 <Dot`> for now, work time
10:50:24 <Dot`> go to sleep cam, its late
10:50:51 <Camail> I am! I quit division and just finished writing some emails
10:53:15 <Camail> i think a big reasoin i could never get into the mmo grind is because the gameplay cycles weren't quite exciting enough
10:53:26 <Camail> I don't feel like I've been grinding almost at all so far
10:53:48 <Camail> anyway, sleep time. I expect you to be at world level 3 by th etime i wake back up

23:43:43 <skram> not yet finished placements
23:45:12 <Crisium> ITS HAPPENING
23:45:14 <Crisium> !
23:45:17 <Crisium> PTR UPDATE
23:45:24 <Crisium> finally
23:45:27 <skram> wat
23:45:28 <skram> WAT
23:45:32 <Crisium> https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760637413?page=6#post-115
23:45:37 <Crisium> MERCY AND JUNKRAT NERFS
23:45:42 <skram> fuk
23:46:12 <Crisium> i hope its enough
23:46:21 <Crisium> honestly i can get over stupid junkrat
23:46:27 <Crisium> i just want mercy nerfed
23:48:21 <skram> but its fun being op cris
23:48:28 <Crisium> Valkyrie reduced from 20s to 15s.  Valkyrie no longer removes rez startup
23:48:56 <skram> hmm
23:49:20 <Crisium> also might have removed the second rez, but unconfirmed
23:49:31 <Crisium> internet is hard to sort fake news from real
23:49:38 <skram> i still think the chain heal/dmg is the best part of valkyrie
23:49:44 <skram> besides the flying bit obviously
23:49:44 <Crisium> it is
23:49:45 <Bio> Mercy can team rez while in Valkyrie and Junkrat gets three mines and two traps. They never said it was a nerf.
23:49:53 <Crisium> speaking of Fake News
23:49:55 <Crisium> Bio pls
23:50:03 <Bio> Kappa
23:50:20 <Crisium> yes, no second res is confirmed
23:50:22 <Crisium> praise the gods
