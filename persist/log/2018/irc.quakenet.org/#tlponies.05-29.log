16:24:01 <skram> Vegas is my favorite fallout but I hope they dont make a new one
16:24:46 <Golly> if its Obsidian yes, otherwise no

16:27:00 <Zounds> Though I've only played 3 and Vegas

17:20:23 <Zounds> XM98 is the most standard bolt action

17:28:44 <DuB`> perfec
17:28:53 <Zounds> 4x scope is the largest that fits on it
17:29:01 <Zounds> No concern if you possess testciles

22:36:53 <Camail> so much pew pew
22:37:10 <Camail> dub you must play when you are able
22:37:33 <DuB`> Yas
22:38:07 <DuB`> I just snipesnipe
22:38:18 <Camail> we can work with that
22:39:14 <Dot`> i tihnk i ay try this planetside game
22:40:01 <DuB`> DOT PLEJ GAME WITH US???
22:40:26 <Dot`> nah, guess not
22:40:33 <DuB`> Camail: I find sitting on a hill 500m away from the fight and clicking at people and racking up kills therapeutic. :P
22:40:37 <DuB`> Dot` D: D: D:
22:40:42 <Dot`> haha
22:41:37 <Camail> well we dont always fight  in areas where that works but you can find outskirts somwhere on the base where thats a thing
22:41:48 <Camail> i also snipe occasionally if the sunderer is in a shitty position
22:42:18 <DuB`> The semi auto snipers work great at mid range, doesn't have to be 500m :P
22:42:30 <Camail> or as a shotgun
22:42:45 <Camail> i love sniping then chilling, and as they push ya just no scope them
22:43:14 <Dot`> assault sniping is the only true way to use a sniper
22:44:30 <DuB`> Gonna go for this i7, 16gb ram, gtx1070, 240gb SSD, 1TB HD now, I think. :O
22:44:51 <Crisium> new pc build?
22:46:28 <Camail> which organ are you selling to get the 1070
22:46:47 <Camail> i suggest kidney, or a foot
22:47:07 <DuB`> The "not paying 3mo of SF rent" thing, mostly!
22:47:39 <DuB`> Organs saved by family connections
22:47:58 <Camail> maybe put a kidney on ice as a back up
22:47:59 <Dot`> its always about who you know
22:48:10 <DuB`> Or who your grandma knows ;D
22:48:24 <Camail> but now you cant start a prostitution ring out of an apartment
22:49:05 <DuB`> Kidneys can go for $100k!
22:49:08 <DuB`> PCs for EVERYONE
22:49:10 <Crisium> glad i got a 1080 before the price gouging
22:49:17 <DuB`> Nice Crisium :o
