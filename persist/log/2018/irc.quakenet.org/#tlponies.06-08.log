02:01:58 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry
02:02:48 <Camail> semmler is a great caster so it makes sense, all he lacked was game knowledge

02:45:29 <Bio> 16
02:45:37 <Bio> you don't instantly kill caleb
02:47:22 <Micen|Droid_> "you almost look innocent." I think is quote of the night
02:50:00 <Camail> god, sam is the shining jewel of this crew
02:50:34 <Crisium> Bio, Caps champs?

03:00:10 <Micen|Droid_> I think I want my next character to be a kenku
03:00:54 <Micen|Droid_> Seeing this is giving me ideas of how to play it without being annoying. 
03:01:04 <Camail> i think i just want a kenku
03:01:32 <Crisium> wooo Glads!
03:01:35 <DuB`> Crisium!!!!
03:01:35 <Crisium> beat the champs
03:01:37 <DuB`> AAAAAAAAAAAAAH
03:01:38 <Micen|Droid_> They did! 
03:01:48 <Camail> WHOHWHOAH
03:01:56 <Camail> thats cool
03:02:08 <Camail> EFFECTS
03:02:16 <Micen|Droid_> I'll have to watch, now that my schedule is returning to nornal.
03:02:40 <Micen|Droid_> Smoke too!
03:02:49 <Bio> this is geek and sundry's entire budget
03:02:50 <Bio> lel
03:02:52 <DuB`> REVERS SWEEEEP
03:03:16 <Bio> dub pls
03:04:03 <Bio> not having nott will suk
03:04:04 <DuB`> That's NYXL's first time ever losing more than once in a stage
03:04:08 <DuB`> Twice in one WEEK
03:04:20 <Crisium> not invincible god
03:04:25 <Crisium> LA can beat them
03:04:42 <Micen|Droid_> The smoke is not as expensive as it seems. Just watched a thing on tested's YouTube about adding smoke effects. 
03:05:04 <Bio> the dwarf forge stuff tho
03:05:37 <Camail> a real fog machine costs $40 on amazon
03:05:51 <Micen|Droid_> I wonder how long till they start 3d printing their own stuff. 
03:05:55 <Camail> i imagine it costs much less to have a smaller variant that doesnt need to pump out as much volume
03:06:19 <Camail> well, when it becomes cheaper to mass produce than normal factories
03:06:33 <Camail> unless they do something different already
03:06:48 <Camail> SAM PLS
03:07:06 <Crisium> Caps win
03:07:16 <Bio> caps are the champs
03:07:18 <Bio> who woulda though
03:07:20 <Bio> t
03:08:01 <Crisium> beat the pens, win the cup
03:08:33 <Bio> but y not use stun first tho
03:18:34 <Camail> and this is why segregating initiatives between PCs and enemies feels terrible
03:18:46 <Camail> imagine every combat being so stilted
03:32:59 <Bio> m9 rolled so bad on init too
03:33:46 <Micen|Droid_> Is that Matt's first mess up since separating his pantheon from the pathfinder one. 
03:33:48 <Micen|Droid_> ? 
03:34:05 <Bio> nah theres been others i think
03:34:14 <Bio> pretty sure i heard a tiamat last ep
03:34:28 <Micen|Droid_> I thought that was from guest. 
03:35:59 <Micen|Droid_> It must be hard to have to undo years of calling the gods one thing. 
03:38:28 <Camail> utility wizzzzard
03:38:53 <Micen|Droid_> I was expecting yasha to try it with her sword. 
03:39:06 <Bio> did travis forget his booming blade
03:39:13 <Micen|Droid_> I think so. 
03:40:01 <Camail> the guy didnt move
03:40:12 <Camail> also he's in the astral plane atm
03:43:41 <Bio> friggin blink

04:16:33 <Micen|Droid_> I want to see Laura get super angry and just start destroying dice. 
04:19:01 <Camail> i dont, that would kinda ruin the night
04:19:03 <Micen|Droid_> God. Sam is starting to sound like Vax with these rolls
04:19:21 <Micen|Droid_> I mean like a YouTube video cam. 
04:19:43 <Micen|Droid_> Thin out the bag of holding for new dice that will behave better

04:20:26 <Bio> k
04:20:28 <Bio> nevmind
04:20:49 <Camail> my guess is that her body hurts a lot cuz of baby chemicals making her bones and organs move around, so her temper is getting shorter by the day

04:23:21 <Camail> legit
04:23:24 <Bio> NO MERCY

04:24:54 <Camail> i kinda get it
04:25:03 <Camail> thunderwave has an awkward angle for this surround

04:28:05 <Bio> sure, but she can be S M E L L E D
04:29:09 <Camail> lul these nerds
04:29:13 <Camail> dont know we have a 6th color
04:29:15 <Camail> its colorless
04:29:26 <Bio> i watched that ep
04:29:28 <Micen|Droid_> Colorless is not a color
04:29:32 <Camail> theres wubrg, colorless, and generic mana
04:29:32 <Bio> was pretty funny
04:29:49 <Camail> it is functionally identical to the other mana types
04:29:58 <Bio> day9 was like, if you have an opening hand with 2 mana, you always mulligan. then he keeps
04:30:15 <Camail> yea but 2 land hands are fine like 80% of the time
04:30:57 <Camail> like, his hand had 2 2 drops so he had something to do all the way through turn 3
04:31:08 <Camail> meaning he had 4 draws to hit a land
04:31:17 <Camail> at worst
04:33:46 <Bio> was just funni
04:34:15 <Bio> also holy shit that 5/5 green dude w/ the kicker

22:52:22 <reification> and just started with the 3rd doctor
22:57:20 <Zounds> have you looked into a powerline adapter DuB` 
22:58:53 <Zounds> you can make use of the wiring in your walls instead of having an ethernet cable running through your entire place
22:59:52 <Zounds> though if that doesn't bother you then it doesn't matter :P
