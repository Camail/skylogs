21:20:16 <Camail> HHHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
21:20:28 <Camail> skram they just changes csgo in a major way
21:20:44 <Camail> the scoped rifles are only $50 more than the m4/ak
21:20:59 <Camail> also the first loss round bonus at the start of the game is 1900
21:21:08 <Camail> so you only eco once after pistol
21:21:15 <Camail> its nutty
21:21:16 <skram> good
21:21:44 <skram> scoped rifles = auto snipers?
21:22:32 <Camail> the sg and the other one
21:22:43 <Camail> aug?
21:23:05 <Camail> the ct one is still pretty shit but the sg kinda replaces the ak
21:24:02 <Camail> but yea round 3 is the new buy round
21:24:24 <Camail> hell, you could have a potential buy round 2 as T if you plant
21:25:45 <Camail> its actually a complete guess no as cts that win pistol if you should get rifles or smgs
