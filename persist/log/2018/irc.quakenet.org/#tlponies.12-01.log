00:23:16 <Camail> so much shooting
00:23:20 <Camail> perhaps too much
00:23:26 <Camail> no such thing
00:27:39 <DuB`> Quite shot
00:29:38 <Camail> Bio  now that dub has a taste of shoots again we can slowly manipulate him into finishing his placement matches
00:33:17 <Bio> lol
00:33:17 <Camail> was fun, everyone got some sick moments
00:33:20 <Bio> nice
00:33:25 <Camail> i shrouded one round
00:33:40 <Camail> 2 shots, 2 juans
00:33:50 <Camail> rialto is probably the best shitty map
00:35:04 <DuB`> It is awful
00:35:24 <DuB`> "Here's a ramp, and here's a ramp. Now go fight."
00:37:51 <Camail> the ramps arent whats important
00:37:58 <Camail> its the alleys and how they're connected
00:38:17 <Camail> unlike the last map, which was just... so bad
00:38:19 <DuB`> Those are just parts of the ramp :P
00:38:28 <Camail> weird rotational symmetry
00:38:32 <DuB`> There just happen to be walls on the ramp
00:38:53 <Camail> the ramps were fiiiiine
00:43:51 <DuB`> ur face is fine
00:44:09 <skram> thats not how you insult someone DuB`
00:48:37 <DuB`> Why would I insult my frens
01:00:03 <skram> sometimes they're being butts, DuB`
01:00:35 <DuB`> Well then you can just call them butts
