03:35:44 <motbob> can't wait for undertale 3
03:36:18 <motbob> "Since I haven't started assembling the team yet I have absolutely no estimation of its completion. It could take up to 999 years depending on the efficiency level."
03:36:32 <Camail> well, nude alert looks promising
03:37:31 <motbob> >toby decides he wants to make bigger, more complicated game
03:37:37 <motbob> >doesn't hire anyone to help him do it
03:38:23 <Camail> sounds like an indie dev who has never had a project manager
03:38:39 <motbob> i can't imagine figuring out how to make a team work after having dictatorial control over your works so far, with great results
03:38:56 <Camail> go to japan?
03:39:53 <Camail> and the only situation where he doesn't have creative control is if he gets a publisher
03:40:31 <motbob> if you're working with other people, you automatically lose some control because other people are putting their thoughts into their work. that's all i mean
03:41:02 <motbob> i think about this a lot with fansubbing
03:43:08 <Camail> yea, it won't be cartesian ideal Toby, but his style is so very obvious, as long as he leads the writing i wouldn't be worried at all
03:43:34 <motbob> i bet
03:43:53 <motbob> i bet it'll be great too
03:44:13 <motbob> i just know from experience that it's gonna be annoying for toby to have to jump into an administrative role
03:44:58 <motbob> i hope he can find a Chief of Staff kind of person
03:45:12 <Camail> he certainly has his pick of anyone available
