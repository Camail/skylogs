00:00:05 <Phearlock> Unless skram has changed drastically he's pretty huggable
00:00:31 <Camail> also phear I've found a criticism, the way they do benevolent/aggressive etc. is a bit shallow, like after playing for this many hours I've played enough to max out every behavior other than cruel and shady
00:01:10 <Camail> seems like every dialog tree adds points to a behavior so at some point you kinda say everything
00:01:19 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
00:01:28 <Dot> skram, your weeks off are timed badly, week 23 is too close, week 29 is 16th of july, my managers child would have just been born
00:01:33 <Dot> so i will be working a lot then
00:01:44 <skram> :(
00:01:48 <Dot> and week 35 is close to when if i dont mess up i am starting an apprenticeship
00:01:52 <Phearlock> Yup I can see that Camail
00:01:58 <Camail> you should infiltrate your manager's house dot
00:02:00 <Camail> become the child
00:02:03 <Crisium> what province do you live in dot
00:02:09 <Crisium> or whatever england is divided into
00:02:13 <Crisium> districts?
00:02:15 <Camail> mini-englands
00:02:15 <Crisium> states?
00:02:19 <Dot> Derbyshire dales, peak district
00:02:19 <Crisium> yeah mini england
00:02:24 <Camail> which mini-england are you in
00:02:28 <skram> scotland
00:02:33 <Crisium> scotland is zounds
00:02:34 <Camail> rip
00:03:07 <skram> How good of a skier are you Dot
00:03:17 <Dot> i skied once when i was like 8
00:03:40 <skram> Excellent, come in winter and my substandard skiing skills wont be that noticable
00:03:50 <Dot> haha
00:04:02 <skram> They'll revoke my citizenship if they find out so dont tell THE GOVERNMENT
00:04:02 <Dot> but its like kinda cold there in winter
00:04:03 <DuB`> SKIIII?
00:04:12 <Crisium> you need to meet in the neutral zone
00:04:23 <Crisium> is there an island between UK and Norway
00:04:31 <Dot> denmark
00:04:41 <Crisium> 3/4 of an island i guess that counts
00:04:43 <skram> faroe islands
00:05:35 <Crisium> shetland islands would be closer right
00:05:52 <Crisium> and they have ponies
00:05:56 <skram> yeah but shetland is great britain
00:05:58 <Camail> apparently my Watcher is famously discreet, but also famously aggressive
00:06:15 <Crisium> oh faroe is independent?
00:06:16 <Camail> they didn't properly set up dichotomies with behavior
00:06:19 <skram> then again, faroe islands is danish so theres really no winning
00:06:23 <Phearlock> People believe exactly the few stories regarding your disposition that they want to believe.
00:06:25 <Crisium> oh denmark strikes again
00:06:31 <Phearlock> =P
00:06:33 <Crisium> the oppression of the kalmar
00:07:06 <Phearlock> But yeah that's a thing they should tweak
00:08:30 <skram> We did win in the end Cris

00:09:14 <Crisium> sweden won first tho
00:10:27 <skram> well
00:10:33 <skram> denmark decided to be friends with napoleon
00:10:43 <Crisium> well it worked at first
00:10:48 <Crisium> he won 5 coalition wars
00:10:52 <Crisium> (then lost the last 2)
00:13:01 <skram> these things never last cris
00:13:14 <skram> just look at england now
00:13:20 <Crisium> so who control EU now
00:13:25 <Crisium> is it Belgium or Germany
00:13:26 <Crisium> i cant tell
00:13:34 <skram> merkel probably
00:13:52 <Camail> Phearlock  no it's worse than that, it was the same person. In the same conversation.
00:13:55 <Dot> i thought it had been germany for a while
00:13:59 <Phearlock> rofl
00:14:01 <Crisium> but capital is Brussels?
00:14:14 <Camail> she greeted me with "wow you get shit done" and ended with "just do it discreetly, like you do"
00:14:18 <skram> Well the seat of the european union yes
00:15:37 <Crisium> so if Germany is Europe anyway, why did you not let Kaiser win
00:15:49 <Crisium> you could all wear spikey helmets

00:16:23 <skram> We were busy war profiteering
00:16:25 <skram> but then not really
00:16:44 <Crisium> norway was neutral
00:17:08 <skram> yep and the merchant navy made good money from both sides
00:17:38 <skram> and then found out they were massively in debt because they lost something like 800 ships
00:19:48 <Crisium> has norway even wared since ww2
00:19:52 <Crisium> what do they do with their guns
00:20:09 <skram> kosovo, afghanistan, iraq
00:20:22 <Crisium> oh cool you fought with us
00:20:24 <Crisium> many thank
00:21:04 <Phearlock> We also helped bomb some stuff nato wanted us to bomb
00:21:13 <skram> We spent like 20 years in kosovo and MJK is fighting pirates at the horn of africa or something
00:25:45 <Camail> ugh, I just got a new party member at level 17
00:25:52 <Camail> time to spend 30 minutes leveling
00:26:07 <Dot> could be worse, they could have been pre leveled
00:26:09 <Camail> this game is wonderfully more open than poe1, but this is a consequence
00:26:16 <Camail> Dot  that's the default
00:26:23 <Camail> i had to toggle that off, and i only found it by chance
00:26:32 <Dot> ewww
00:26:35 <Camail> most people prefer that
00:26:37 <Camail> because they suck
00:27:14 <Camail> well this party member is ashley johnsen, i like her more than marisha so i think she'll stay
00:28:29 <Camail> ooooh wtf is a sidekick, that's cool
00:28:32 <Camail> this game did a cool thing
00:33:49 <Dot> yay thing
00:39:12 <Camail> the passives in this game are also way better
00:40:09 <Camail> poe1 had a general laundry list tucked away in the corner, + resist to various things
00:40:32 <Camail> poe2 is more designed, and with a multiclass sometimes really good
00:45:07 <Dot> skram, what doing

18:35:22 <Runbunny> I was just meeting a friend and hanging out for a while.
18:35:55 <Runbunny> But I am getting up early tomorrow, so I am just going to waste my time looking at lights on my screen.

18:43:18 <Zounds> o/
18:45:03 <Cane> So today is the Nurburging 24 hour endurance race, and we have a main stream and like 15 in-car POV streams, all on YouTube.
18:45:09 <Cane> The future is pretty cool.
18:46:48 <Cane> Also that.
18:46:52 <Crisium> what is N
18:47:00 <DuB`> oooh
18:47:03 <DuB`> Gimme
18:47:04 <Cane> Sorry QuakeNet, motorsports > eurovision.
18:47:11 <DuB`> Haha
18:47:22 <Cane> For WEC? =)
18:47:28 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxOzJPBhlVY is main stream.
18:47:29 <Dot`> cane pls, N is an old stick figure game :P
18:47:38 <DuB`> Yussss
18:48:04 <Cane> https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8iujjb/this_weekend_is_the_n%C3%BCrburgring_24_hours_race/dyuphg0/ has a list of POV streams.
18:48:14 <Cane> I go to them randomly as interesting shit happens on the main stream.
18:48:58 <Cane> Porsche has a good overlay but their feed lags a ton.
18:49:12 <Cane> The R8 feeds are silky smooth but there's like no information on screen.
18:49:14 <Cane> Pick your poison.
18:49:35 <DuB`> Oh, audi!
18:49:52 <DuB`> They've dropped Le Mans for a few years
18:50:13 <DuB`> After volkswagen emissions scandal cost them billions or whatever
18:50:31 <Cane> Sucks, I really love the R8.
18:50:46 <DuB`> Also not participating this year, it seems
18:50:54 <DuB`> Wonder why Nurburg but not Le Mans
18:51:26 <Cane> Yeah, I've no idea.
18:51:31 <skrm> Because if you wanna compete in LMP1 it costs infinity dollars
18:51:41 <skrm> these are just race rigged production cars right?
18:51:59 <DuB`> Most
18:52:04 <Golly> pit stops seem a tad more relaxed than f1
18:52:23 <Cane> Isn't the Mercedes SLS just the most gorgeous car though? Look at that main stream right now.
18:52:27 <Cane> Just so sweet.
18:52:33 <DuB`> Keeping the car 100% > Saving a few seconds in pits for a 24 hour race :P
18:52:42 <skrm> oh yeah
18:53:03 <skrm> the AMG specced mercs are the most good looking cars out there probably
18:53:10 <Cane> I know, it's so good.
18:53:31 <Golly> pffft lada 4ev
18:53:33 <Cane> I fell in love with the road version, but the AMG GT3 racing variants haven't lost much despite the racing logos all over them.
18:53:45 <Cane> My aunt and uncle had a blue boxy Lada when I was growing up.
18:53:54 <Cane> I thought it was a genuinely classic car.
18:54:16 <Golly> hah
18:55:41 <DuB`> Hmph
18:56:09 <DuB`> I understand not having a full LMP1 team with the R10s or whatever, but audi isn't sending anyone for ANY class
18:57:19 <DuB`> I guess "Audi Sport Team Land" isn't actually an audi team, just a sponsored private team. Oh well
18:57:23 <Cane> Yeah I know, they're missed.
18:57:56 <skrm> Well they dominated for a bit and now its someone elses turn
18:57:59 <skrm> thats how it works right
18:58:26 <DuB`> Toyota v Audi v Porsche is much more interesting that JUST Toyota v Random private teams for LMP1 :P
18:58:32 <DuB`> Unfortunately
18:59:02 <Cane> At least Volkswagen have been completely killing it in WRC.
18:59:12 <Cane> Ogier + Polo just won everything.
18:59:23 <DuB`> I haven't kept up with WRC much, I should
18:59:47 <skrm> did nissan drop out after the whole gamer driver thing they did a few years ago?
19:04:17 <Cane> skrm, I don't think I know what you're talking about.
19:06:17 <Bio> i just kneed my desk sitting down
19:06:23 <Bio> my life is eternal pain
19:06:28 <Bio> owowowo
19:08:42 <Cane> SHIT.
19:08:49 <DuB`> waow
19:08:50 <Cane> I was watching that.
19:09:24 <Cane> That was not his fault. =(
19:09:33 <Cane> Sparks from the car in front basically fucked him.
19:10:00 <skrm> Nissan ran a big tournament in some video game where the winner would compete on their LMP1 team
19:10:29 <Cane> Wat.
19:11:11 <Cane> Okay yeah, he nudged the car on the left when he went for the overtake.
19:11:54 <Dot`> this is a weird thing skram

19:12:55 <Cane> The Last Starfighter was REAL.
19:14:03 <Cane> There are so many cars on the track today.
19:15:19 <Cane> You hate to see an R8 get broken, you really do.
19:17:00 <Runbunny> Dot`, skrm https://i.imgur.com/vMBxz2k.mp4
19:17:21 <Dot`> clumsy ferrets
19:17:44 <DuB`> I prefer the more intense cars of Le Mans, but boy is Nurburg a more interesting track. :P

19:22:52 <Cane> Sigh, still sad about the R8 going out like that.
19:23:30 <Zounds> Runbunny: you got any plans to do the skirmish weekly?
19:23:45 <Cane> Also the 911 has been killing it all race.
19:23:57 <Runbunny> I'm not sure.
19:23:59 <Cane> That is a very yellow color too. =)
19:24:03 <Runbunny> I am like 3/10 currently.
19:24:09 <Zounds> Same
19:25:36 <DuB`> Oh weird
19:25:44 <DuB`> Didn't know abou the minimum pit stop time

19:26:16 <Zounds> Could be decent if they go for you first xP
19:26:51 <Zounds> Otherwise I die in the opener
19:27:08 <Zounds> As is tradition for spriest with anything but sometimes mage or rogue in 2v2 historically
19:28:23 <Cane> Darkness falls upon the Nurburgring. Lot of pit stops and driver changes atm.
19:30:54 <DuB`> Attending a race live would be weird
19:31:17 <DuB`> Actually being there seems like it would just be more of camping/partying in a really noisy place :P
19:31:27 <DuB`> Much rather watch from riiiight here.
19:35:07 <Cane> Yeah, attending a WRC race is just an excuse to watch Mitsubishi Evos and Volkswagen Polos jumping loudly through the air once in a while as you're having a barbecue.
19:35:28 <Cane> The Scandinavian leg of any rally season is so much fun.
19:36:13 <DuB`> Hehe
19:36:13 <Cane> It's just a bunch of drunk Scandinavians grilling hotdogs and cheering loudly whenever a car jumps by.
19:36:23 <DuB`> Sounds right
19:36:28 <Runbunny> Sounds like a good time.
19:36:54 <Cane> Hotdog grilling is a spectator sport if you're doing it while there's a rally on. - Scandinavians, probably
19:37:35 <skrm> oh heck yeah
19:38:53 <Cane> On that note, can the French stop being so good at rally? It's getting embarrassing.
19:38:55 <skrm> Theres a local rally race where I live every year and theres a great spot with a giant jump that I usually set up my hotdog station
19:39:10 <Cane> See?
19:39:13 <Cane> I speak truth.
19:39:47 <Cane> One of these days I'd love to go to Vargåsen and set up next to the jump. <3
19:39:48 <DuB`> :D
19:40:10 <Cane> Østberg loves showing off at that jump even if it's not optimal, it's great. =D
19:40:21 <Cane> Dude jumped 42 meters this season.
20:06:26 <Cane> So many cars and so many classes.
20:23:16 <Cane> If not for the AMG, the Aston Martin V8 Vantage would be the most gorgeous thing on this track I think.
20:23:39 <Cane> Shame there's no POV for the Astons.
20:28:41 <Cane> lol, they might have one hell of a time tomorrow morning at this race apparently. That weather forecast is hilarious.
20:28:57 <Cane> Possible thunderstorm, heavy winds, big hailstones.
20:33:09 <Cane> Oh cool, there's an X-Bow.
20:48:07 <DuB`> dat forecast 
20:48:08 <DuB`> lol
20:49:26 <DuB`> Fire in ferrari pitlane, quick send the car!
20:49:28 <DuB`> Wahaha
20:49:57 <Cane> Hahahah that was great!
20:50:10 <Cane> Fucking motorsports. "K fire out, gogogo."
20:56:11 <DuB`> "I'm sure some of the people partying around the circuit don't even know there's a race goin' on!"
20:58:01 <Cane> I like how they were talking about smelling the barbecued sausages and talking about the partying in the hills. That's definitely motorsports. =)
21:00:54 <skrm> This porsches gas mileage is TERRIBLE
21:01:00 <Cane> I've been watching the POV of the Team Black Falcon car, the AMG, currently #3 in the race behind the two 911s. He's caught up so much, it's fantastic.
21:01:00 <skrm> 0/10 would not own
21:01:09 <Cane> lol
21:03:17 <skrm> Is there a place where I can see that current standings live?
21:05:08 <Cane> I was trying to find some earlier and couldn't. I just try to pay attention to the main stream 'cause they show the current standings every 15 minutes or so.

21:08:40 <Cane> I KNOW
21:08:56 <Cane> Tell me that isn't the most beautiful car on the track today. I dare you.
21:10:04 <Dot`> watched pony, silly argueing horses/10
21:10:20 <skrm> The Aston is gorgeous too but something looks odd with the grill
21:11:05 <Cane> <Cane> If not for the AMG, the Aston Martin V8 Vantage would be the most gorgeous thing on this track I think.
21:11:30 <Cane> Yeah, the AMG is just the complete package. Aston has the shape down though.
21:11:50 <skrm> agreed
21:11:57 <skrm> all the porches are sorta been there done that
21:13:57 <skrm> Unless we're talking about the 917 with the blue gulf oil livery which is the best looking race car of all time
21:13:59 <skrm> fite me
21:14:18 <Cane> I respect the 911 a lot more than I like it.
21:16:28 <skrm> Oh yeah, and its been made since the early sixties
21:17:04 <Cane> That's why I respect it. It managed to hit a classic look and they put the engine in the wrong place, but then through clever engineering it became a fantastic car.
21:17:47 <skrm> I work with some hardcore VW dudes and apparently every other car has it in the wrong place, Cane
21:17:58 <Cane> Hahah
21:17:59 <Cane> It's a thing.
21:18:02 <skrm> They're a weird bunch. Water cooling is a cardinal sin.

21:19:57 <Cane> Endurance races. <3
21:20:38 <Cane> Oof. I didn't know that beautiful yellow AMG got bumped. Looks good now though.
21:20:55 <Cane> lol weather forecast.
21:21:17 <Cane> Of course there's gonna be a storm with possible golfball sized hailstones during an endurance race.
21:21:43 <Cane> Is the Carrera GT the best looking Porsche ever?
21:21:44 <skrm> Chrysler doge?
21:21:46 <skrm> hold on
21:22:28 <skrm> Is that the one dodge sponsored by dogecoin that was on reddit

21:28:26 <DuB`> Now already 330pm and I've just watched this :P

21:32:26 <DuB`> F1 race tomorrow morning, too!
21:33:07 <Cane> Oh no shit, nice.
21:34:37 <DuB`> First 4 races wer australia, bahraain, china, and azerbaijan... not exactly easy timezones for me :P

21:39:33 <DuB`> Janky bootleg streams or bust!\
21:40:30 <Cane> DuB`, let's be friends and share bootleg streams. <3
21:58:23 <Cane> Damn, Müller's AMG is only ~20 seconds behind the 1st place right now, and they've been racing for hours. That's impressive.
21:58:50 <Cane> Hmm.
21:58:59 <Cane> Miscalculated.
21:59:04 <Cane> Gap's a couple of minutes.
21:59:24 <Cane> That is a very pink R8.
21:59:26 <Cane> That's lovely.
21:59:46 <DuB`> Hehe
21:59:57 <DuB`> That glickenhaus thing is pretty wild
22:06:11 <Cane> I dig the X-Bows.
22:06:25 <DuB`> For sure
22:06:48 <DuB`> I like them a lot more with the top cover :P
22:07:36 <Cane> Bit drafty the basic model. =P
22:08:26 <Cane> I really dig ultralights. Ariel Atom, KTM X-Bow, BAC Mono, etc.
22:08:40 <Cane> The BAC Mono in white and black is just sick. =D
22:10:37 <DuB`> First time I've seen the Huracan on stream
22:10:41 <DuB`> Very nice
22:11:02 <Cane> So Muller has climbed all the way up to +43.8s
22:11:07 <Cane> His AMG is kicking ass.
22:11:19 <DuB`> wew
22:11:26 <Cane> He's consistently hitting faster laps than the Porsches.
22:11:55 <Cane> 10 seconds faster than #1 last lap.
22:19:26 <DuB`> Good point by commentator, I'm one of the people mourning no Nissan GTRs very much :(
22:20:46 <Cane> And they just introduced a new one. They really should be here. =/
22:22:10 <Cane> Hell yes, Muller is in 2nd place now.
22:22:16 <Cane> Go AMG. <3

22:27:15 <Cane> Doh.
22:27:19 <Cane> That was... close.

22:33:01 <Cane> Not the damn 48 AMG again!
22:33:09 <Cane> That yellow AMG has had a horrible time.
22:33:10 <skrm> I MISSED IT
22:33:12 <skrm> dang.
22:33:17 <Cane> You can left arrow and rewind.

22:33:22 <Cane> Pretty good.
22:34:02 <skrm> oh dang.
22:34:04 <skrm> you're right
22:34:20 <DuB`> Someone forgot to secure the wheel? :T
22:34:46 <Cane> I don't know, but I think some mechanic is currently sweating bullets.
22:34:50 <DuB`> srs
22:36:28 <skrm> Someone is getting fired :p
22:37:58 <Cane> Ug. I'm tired. Should sleep. Don't wanna.
22:38:30 <Cane> What the bugger.
22:38:33 <DuB`> LOL
22:38:34 <skrm> haha what
22:39:31 <Cane> I would not be surprised if they get more than a stern talking to from the marshals for that stunt.
22:41:13 <skrm> Probably
22:42:13 <skrm> did they actually put a new tire on it while it was stranded on the track
22:42:53 <skrm> ah no
22:45:55 <Cane> I was gonna go sleep but now I want to know what the hell happened to that tire.
22:46:37 <skrm> You left it on the track and now it belongs to us

22:49:38 <Camail> poe2 was a good game
22:50:00 <Phearlock> Haha you really blew through it.
22:50:01 <Camail> kinda wish i upped the dificulty near the end, but overall solid 9/10
22:50:11 <Phearlock> I think I'm like halfway?
22:50:14 <Camail> yea, and its shorter than the first
22:50:34 <Camail> the final boss was really easy, unfortunately
22:51:19 <Camail> but i have a feeling the hardest difficulty really ramps it up and makes the ai play perfectly
22:51:34 <Camail> which would probably completely ruin my team comp
22:53:10 <Camail> there's an entirely separate section of the credits for the cast of critical role
22:53:19 <Camail> I didn't realize how deep that relationship was
22:53:31 <Phearlock> interestin
22:53:34 <Camail> they're above all the other cast
22:53:56 <Camail> also I'm angry i didn't catch who travis voiced
22:53:59 <Camail> i got all the others
22:54:15 <Phearlock> you gonna hop right into a second playthrough soon or gonna wait for some of the DLC?
22:54:45 <DuB`> Should I get Poe1 dlc, btw?
22:54:48 <Camail> not gonna do a second run just yet
22:55:02 <Camail> probably dub, but its....i dunno
22:55:08 <Phearlock> The White march? If you're enjoying the game I'd say so.
22:55:09 <Camail> the poe1 dlc almost assumes you beat the game once
22:55:19 <Phearlock> It adds more game
22:55:39 <Cane> Holy shit, AMG lives.
22:55:40 <DuB`> Another $30 :T
22:55:43 <Camail> it adds more game, but then so does poe2
22:55:53 <Phearlock> Yeah, it's not required.
22:56:13 <Camail> i'd skip it and just get poe2, if that's the opportunity cost
22:56:19 <DuB`> Cane, I'm sure all those sparks didn't affect anything important. ;D
22:56:30 <DuB`> Suuuurely
22:56:57 <Phearlock> yeah if money is an issue skipping it for now and going to Poe2 if you want more once you're done is probably best.

22:57:25 <Cane> DuB`, that was just the driver powersliding through the corner for a turbo boost. =D
22:57:30 <DuB`> Not an "issue" I guess, just wanted to ask how worth it is.
22:57:47 <Camail> play through 80% of poe1 first
22:57:48 -!- BioPone [~androirc@mobile-166-175-59-240.mycingular.net] has joined #tlponies
22:57:54 <BioPone> Horsemen
22:57:54 <Camail> if you love it, it's more of that
22:57:59 <Camail> it's endgame dlc
22:58:04 <DuB`> Oke
22:58:20 <DuB`> Not sure how far I am
22:58:22 <Camail> and if you get hooked on the world, the gameplay, the story, then it's worth it
22:58:26 <Camail> the game is like 100 hours
22:58:30 <Camail> get lik 50 in
22:58:45 <DuB`> waow
22:58:59 <Camail> poe2 is mush less
22:59:14 <Camail> maybe poe1 was like, 80 hours, it's hard to tell
22:59:48 <Camail> i have 230 steam hours in from 2 play throughs
23:00:00 <DuB`> I had a quest bug and have been playing through a mod launcher that seems to have fixed it, so not sure how many hours I have 
23:00:06 <DuB`> Doesn't show properly in steam now
23:00:09 <Camail> yea dub, it's a a true CRPG
23:00:12 <Camail> gonna be a long haul
23:00:19 <Phearlock> Poe1 was about 70ish hours for me for a first playthrough without the dlc
23:00:30 <Camail> dlc adds a lot of content
23:00:47 <Camail> i loved the dlc, but that's cuz i love the lore
23:00:50 <Phearlock> So 100 hours for a playthrough of boths ounds about right.
23:01:28 <DuB`> Goodie
23:04:36 <Camail> hmm, apparently less than 1% have beaten the game
23:06:02 <Phearlock> poe2?
23:06:13 <Phearlock> or 1?
23:06:22 <Cane> Alright, I'm gonna go crash. DuB`, skrm, PM me if nutty things happen. <3
23:06:28 <Cane> Nighty night everyone!
23:06:36 <DuB`> G'night!
23:06:38 <skrm> Alright man, have a good one
23:06:45 <DuB`> I'm just waiting on that weather to arrive
23:06:46 <DuB`> Should get fun
23:06:48 <Phearlock> Cause gog achievements weren't a thing when I played Poe1 so I don't think I have the achievement for completing the game =P
23:14:51 <reification> night all
23:19:44 <Camail> Phearlock  oh sorry, of poe 2
23:21:19 <Camail> 10.7% have beaten poe1
23:23:00 <Dot`> gnight reif
23:24:32 <Camail> phear it turns out taliesan voiced the big boy
23:24:50 <Camail> even knowing that i STILL can not hear his voice through the modulation
23:25:06 <Phearlock> lol, nice
23:25:12 <Camail> also, i am gonna call him big boy form now on
23:25:28 <Camail> it makes it easy to talk about without dancing around terms
23:25:50 <Camail> but yea if i play again i need to play something less optimal
