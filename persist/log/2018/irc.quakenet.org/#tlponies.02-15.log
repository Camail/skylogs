00:04:18 <Crisium> Opportunist wasnt changed
00:04:24 <Crisium> i think the patch notes were a mistake withthat
00:05:54 <Crisium> https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20762046101#post-5
00:06:10 <Crisium> Opportunist will only show thr walls below 50%
00:06:24 <Crisium> but it will show enemy health (not through walls) if they hurt at all
00:11:11 <Cane> In that case the world is normal and not broken.

17:09:48 <DuB`> Also thursday critrole wooo
17:11:42 <Zounds> oberwaj was a good time yesterday
17:13:24 <DuB`> Last night I somehow ended up listening to a brazilian trap playlist
17:13:50 <DuB`> And then I ended up playing lucio on lijiang and went both rounds with 0 deaths and like 30 elims 
17:13:54 <DuB`> Stylin' on em
17:13:57 <DuB`> Was so fun haha
17:14:12 <Zounds> Oh right trap music

17:19:37 <Zounds> I'm a bit torn on whether to focus on McCree or Soldier for practice
17:20:04 <Zounds> McCree is statistically my better hero despite what cris says
17:20:13 <Zounds> But soldier is a bit less frustrating to play with mobility and heals
17:20:18 <Zounds> Though not nearly as satisfying
17:20:22 <Zounds> but still fun
17:21:22 <Zounds> I guess it just depends on the map and the comp/enemy comp
17:22:36 <DuB`> ya ya
17:22:54 <DuB`> Agree with the "somehow end up on him -> enjoy" bit haha

17:23:13 <DuB`> anymore*
17:26:24 <Zounds> Aye :P
17:26:35 <Zounds> Rein used to be like that for me too but I've been picking him more recently
17:26:46 <Zounds> I just try to embrace my badness
17:26:59 <Zounds> Feels like my shield just evaporates and I spend all my time swinging these days
17:27:32 <Zounds> I'll take Orisa if it's srs business though

19:47:43 <skram> is that a roll bar
19:48:20 <DuB`> Ye they'll all have those lil things above the cockpit now
19:48:38 <skram> y tho
19:48:44 <skram> isnt the intake stronk enough
19:48:55 <DuB`> dunno
19:53:30 <Cane> Early access, RIP
19:54:04 <Cane> 4 player co-op. Ooo.
19:55:14 <Cane> Yeah that's a roll bar of sorts, it's to protect drivers from debris and rolls.
19:55:23 <Cane> Hence why it's right smack in the middle of the goddamned cockpit.
19:56:07 <DuB`> Yeah, after some reading it seems to be almost more for debris than anything
19:56:11 <DuB`> No tires to the face, etc
19:56:27 <Cane> Yup.
19:56:36 <Cane> I think it was mandated after a driver got a tire to the helmet.
19:57:20 <Cane> I drove one of these in a racing sim. It's awful when you don't have stereo vision with depth perception because it's just right there, and you can't see "past" it really.
19:57:27 <Cane> I'm sure it's fine irl though.

22:55:16 <Bio> is that the game that people have been liking
22:55:19 <Bio> recently
22:57:18 <Bio> forgot it was made by the people that did Natural Selection 2
23:07:47 <Phearlock_> It's pretty nice
23:07:59 <Phearlock_> it says survival but honestly it's exploration
23:08:30 <Phearlock_> got 15 hours in it so far
23:30:41 <Camail> It's a very forgiving game, it's certainly not trying to make it really hard to survive
23:31:02 <Camail> and if you dont like survival resource mechanics then they literally just let you turn them off
23:37:07 <Phearlock_> yeah it's not hard, but it's got a lovely atmosphere and it's really fun to get access to stuff to let you explore more things.
23:39:23 <Camail> some of those fish are big and toothy
23:44:09 <Phearlock_> It's a bit spooky sometimes =D
