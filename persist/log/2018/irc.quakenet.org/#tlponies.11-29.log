21:10:02 <reification> dot i spoke to bun on sunday and he said about a week
21:15:31 <Dot> hmm
22:03:32 <Camail> reif i've come to the conclusion that the most boring dailies are the ones where you dont do the deck building
22:03:44 <Camail> the in combat decisions are like, not even close to as satisfying
22:04:02 <Camail> so the ones that replace card reward with artifacts are terrible
22:04:17 <Camail> the ones that give you a random 50 card deck are also dumb 
22:04:36 <Camail> and that one that gave you every rare in the game was the worst
22:05:48 <Camail> sealed is by far my favorite
22:06:08 <reification> i have enjoyed the deck building ones
22:06:33 <Camail> even the normal amount of deck building is acceptable
22:06:46 <Camail> i just dont like when deck building is virtually ignored
22:07:57 <Camail> hey dub what put you off of STS
22:08:10 <Camail> i know you tried it, would be interesting in knowing your opinion
22:11:18 <DuB`> Hmm
22:11:35 <DuB`> I think I just have trouble enjoying games where you do "runs"
22:11:42 <DuB`> I like to KEEP my progress :P
22:12:02 <DuB`> It's why I've never picked up FTL even though everything else about the game looks great
22:12:55 <Camail> yea, sts is honestly the exception for me in that regard
22:13:10 <Camail> the runs are so short that i dont feel like i'm losing progress
22:13:36 <DuB`> It didn't feel so short to me :o
22:13:37 <Camail> but in roguelikes/lights i feel empty
22:13:45 <DuB`> Probly just because I was figuring it out though
22:13:49 <Camail> a STS run never goes more than an hour
22:14:05 <Camail> at most like 70 minutes
22:16:13 <Camail> once you figure out the mechanics, asc 0 is pretty easy
22:16:19 -!- skrm [webchat@pioj.eid3.887x.ip] has joined #tlponies
22:18:39 <Camail> to me, winning in sts is like winning a 1v1 game vs an ai
22:18:58 <Camail> like in sc2, you restart from scratch every game, there is no progression
22:19:04 <Camail> and sts taps into that for me
22:19:12 <Camail> i dont know why
