21:00:04 <Bio> something something gods light
21:00:09 <Dot> .butt zounds
21:07:16 <Zounds> maybe I'm just not too bothered by appearances
21:07:25 <Zounds> maybe I just care about personality
21:10:21 <Zounds> Not some shallow guy who needs his waifus to vaguely resemble humans like anime grillz do
21:10:54 <Zounds> so it is you all who are degenerate!
21:11:12 <Crisium> it's the children who are wrong
21:11:46 <DuB`> Being attracted to things that don't even vaguely resemble your own species sounds like a pretty negative trait evolution-wise.
21:14:02 <Zounds> doesn't really hurt much if it's not exclusive
21:18:42 <Camail> but statistically, most things are not shaped like women
21:18:54 <Camail> so the chance of you being attracted to a human women are way lower
21:19:15 <Camail> on your way to a date you might just fall in love with a lamp post
21:19:26 <Camail> and then your family line ends right there
21:20:54 <Crisium> but the future refused to change
21:24:54 <Cane> Chrono Trigger reference.
21:25:15 <Crisium> aye
21:25:50 <Zounds> I keep shooting training bots in OW
21:25:58 <Zounds> All it's making me do is get better at shooting training bots
21:26:04 <Crisium> you want plej?
21:26:21 <Crisium> training bot headbox too big
21:26:22 <Crisium> bad practice
21:26:36 <Zounds> Sure
21:26:44 <Zounds> Yeh I was not really practicing tbh
21:26:46 <Crisium> ok give me 5
21:27:05 <Zounds> unless 270 degree flick shots are something I plan to do
21:31:13 <Crisium> comp or qp
21:31:45 <Zounds> either is good for me
21:32:09 <Zounds> if anyone else wants to stack then qp but comp otherwise
21:32:18 <Zounds> Micen|Droid: DuB` ?
