00:38:42 <Bio> pani
00:38:45 <DuB`> Phearlock, my own colony's forces and space station "don't trust me enough" to let me join battles on their side to defend them >_>
00:38:48 <Bio> well done on the not dying thing
00:39:00 <Bio> SPAEC?
00:39:10 <Bio> you still doing eve dab
00:39:27 <DuB`> Currently starsector
00:40:35 <Bio> oic
00:40:40 <Bio> imma get some icecream
00:41:43 <Phearlock> did you turn on your transponder DuB` ?
00:42:21 <Phearlock> so that they know you are you?
00:43:54 <DuB`> Ya
00:48:53 <DuB`> I'm at net +230k/mo from colonies now
00:49:00 <DuB`> 2 fully built ones and 2 new
00:49:54 <Phearlock> All the money =D
00:50:13 <Phearlock> Got any juicy blueprints? Fun times with capital ships?
00:50:38 <DuB`> Found a Paragon BS bp very early on, actually
00:50:58 <DuB`> Finally had enough resources etc to get that build on, my colony fleets are scary
00:51:06 <Phearlock> lol sweet
00:51:25 <Phearlock> I have astrals and paragons as my colony fleet too now
00:52:34 <DuB`> Game finally let me start getting new ships, dunno what fixed it
00:52:48 <Phearlock> v0v
00:53:07 <DuB`> Was able to bring down a battlecarrier and a pair of battlecruisers with my missile cruiser groups and take them for myself
00:53:14 <DuB`> Missle cruisers are my fave
00:53:28 <Phearlock> Yeah the Gryphon? It's amazing under player control
00:53:41 <Phearlock> Sabots and hammer barrage
00:53:44 <reification> night all
00:53:44 <Phearlock> good times =P
00:54:36 <Phearlock> actually hm, I do know that if you're running up against the maximum amount of ships you can have in your fleet
00:54:50 <Phearlock> it won't show many ships to recover past what you would be able to fill your fleet with
00:54:59 <Phearlock> limit in vanilla is I think 30-40? ships
00:56:52 <DuB`> Could have been that
00:57:46 <Phearlock> I'm at like 600,000 a month income in my save now, wondering if it's time to just start bombarding some opposing factions =P
00:58:19 <Phearlock> just some genocide on the side you know?
01:00:31 <DuB`> Haha
01:00:40 <DuB`> I haven't tried invasion stuff
01:01:10 <Phearlock> I tried doing some raiding to try get some extra blueprints
01:01:20 <Phearlock> was ok I guess but not super profitable
01:01:32 <Phearlock> I didn't have any troop transports to buff my marines though so that might have been it
01:03:57 <DuB`> Ye
01:04:10 <DuB`> Oh man I just love watching torpedo salvos just one-shot capitals
01:04:46 <Phearlock> yus =3
01:05:13 <Phearlock> torpedo bomber astral is my baby. Truly no greater lategame ship detetion device
01:07:26 <DuB`> Only thing I like more than a missile boat is a carrier :P
01:08:25 <Phearlock> I mean for personal control I'm more of a battlecruiser guy. But I gotta have them carriers and missiles in my fleet.
01:08:52 <Phearlock> And heck both the battlecruisers in starsector have very effective missile layouts xD
01:09:43 <DuB`> Ooooh astral has SIX fighter wings, nice
01:10:06 <Phearlock> The ship system is the crazy thing
01:10:38 <Phearlock> Fighter recall lets it teleport back and rearm its bomber wings for another run right after they've fired their initial volley
01:10:44 <DuB`> Wild
01:11:05 <Phearlock> If you don't kill the bombers coming in it'll just keep pounding away with torpedo barrages
01:11:11 <Phearlock> it's pretty sick
02:02:22 <Bio> sleepy time

20:12:08 <Zounds> lucky guy
20:12:32 <Phearlock> Oh is dub dead?
20:12:49 <Phearlock> Or is someone else dead?
20:13:13 <skram> dub lives
20:13:18 <skram> its runbun that we're worried about
20:13:19 <skram> well
20:13:22 <skram> reif is worried
20:13:34 <Phearlock> oh
20:13:57 <Phearlock> Yeah I'd prefer runbun to be alive
20:14:05 <Phearlock> he's like the only nice danish person I know
20:14:18 <Phearlock> (He's the only danish person I know)
20:15:39 <skram> top 3 at the very least
20:23:45 <Phearlock> Skram I have an idea for next time we see a dragon
20:24:06 <Phearlock> We need like, a portable ramp. Pick up the lvl 1 spell jump on next levelup.
20:24:17 <Phearlock> Then we cast that (no concentration) on you + haste
20:24:22 <Phearlock> and you try airtackle it
20:24:42 <Phearlock> Needs a bit of setup but I think it's a solid plan
20:24:49 <Dot> haha
20:25:08 <DuB`> Basically an aircraft carrier catapult
20:25:12 <skram> basically you wanna do the fastball special
20:25:15 <skram> im into it
20:25:28 <DuB`> Strap some bombs to the dwarf and off he goes
20:25:43 <Dot> whats your carry weight skram?
20:26:43 <skram> dont know
20:27:24 <skram> srd says high jump is 3+STR which would be 7
20:27:27 <skram> so 21 feet
20:27:35 <skram> which is a lot but probably not enough to go on a dragon?
20:28:02 <Phearlock> Yeah we'd have to bend the rules a bit
20:28:07 <Phearlock> Hence the ramp and haste
20:28:17 <skram> true true
20:28:22 <skram> need a good athletics roll
20:28:59 <Phearlock> It does say that you can sometimes jump further in the right circumstance
20:29:09 <Phearlock> And I think this would qualify
20:30:08 <skram> should get advantage because it would be AWESOME
20:30:44 <Phearlock> Either that or I haste sigrund
20:30:56 <Phearlock> And then dot can jump off of her midair like yoshi
20:30:59 <Phearlock> for extra distance
20:31:35 <skram> yes
20:31:38 <skram> this is what i want
20:34:17 <Dot> hasted run, jump, misty step then jump off
20:34:30 <Dot> thats probably max i can do, but my athletics sucks
20:34:44 <Dot> unless skram throws me
20:34:44 <Phearlock> Yeah and the dwarf does a lot more damage as a projectile
20:34:46 <Phearlock> heavier
20:36:08 <Dot> in a round im pretty sure i can do more damage than skram, but only for 2-3 rounds, then i am out of spell slots
20:36:25 <Phearlock> that is true
20:36:28 <Dot> then im just a halfing on a dog
20:36:57 <skram> yeh i'd like to see you do 140 damage in 3 rounds
20:36:58 <Dot> the amount of damage if i crited like skram would be great
20:37:40 <Phearlock> Mmm dps meters
20:37:44 <Phearlock> Gonna make a real rpg
20:37:48 <Phearlock> out of this dnd session
20:40:25 <Dot> haha
20:44:02 <Dot> i just want to be as good as a barbarian
20:45:11 <Phearlock> We just need to find some undead
20:45:29 <Phearlock> get that mega smite damage
20:45:48 <Dot> i should have picked the anti dragon class instead of the anti undead
20:47:43 <DuB`> Sneak attack > rage

21:03:48 <Phearlock> I'm still on the fence about grabbing a switch, lemme know how smash is xD
21:08:18 <Cane> I don't blame you, they're still expensive.
21:08:42 <Cane> But between Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Zelda BotW, and now Smash Ultimate, I pulled the trigger. But let's be fair, it's mostly for Ultimate.
21:10:55 <Phearlock> Yeah if smash just turns out to be really good I probably will just grab it.

21:16:17 <Dot> PHEAR! Happy Birthday <3
21:16:25 <Camail> so today is a birthday sandwich? some sort of birthday limbo where we float between celebrations
21:16:27 <Phearlock> Ok, did you grab the dependancies? Lazylib and Graphicslib and enable them in the launcher?
21:16:39 <DuB`> Ya I did
21:16:42 <Camail> also
21:16:46 <DuB`> Also happy old day :D
21:16:48 <Camail> neeeeeeeeeeeeerds
21:17:13 <Phearlock> Ok, did you start a new game? Any mod that adds planets won't take effect on an exisiting game as planets are only generated on a new save.
21:17:37 <DuB`> I can't get past the launcher >_>
21:18:08 <Phearlock> Ok how exactly is it failing to work?
21:18:47 <Camail> wow
21:18:58 <Camail> thus conversation is giving me flashbacks to setting up my dad's computer
21:19:04 <DuB`> I click "Play" and it crashes with an error message like I mentioned above
21:19:06 <DuB`> lol cam
21:19:18 <Camail> what the error message!
21:19:22 <DuB`> Ah hold on I might have had an out of date graphicslib
21:20:13 <Phearlock> Also the Help desk channel in the starsector discord has a really in-depth guide on setting up a mod install (Though the links to mods themselves is for .8 and might be outdated).
21:20:31 <DuB`> Cool
21:20:34 <Phearlock> just scroll to the top of it
21:22:48 <Phearlock> And always delete the mods folder instead of overwriting when updating.
21:22:52 <Phearlock> xD
21:23:31 <DuB`> Ye

21:53:40 <Bio> bek
21:53:43 <DuB`> Phearlock: I'm an idiot and finally found a comprehensive list of which mods are actually built for .9 or not, that was the problem xP
21:55:03 <Phearlock> Yes
21:55:15 <Phearlock> Check the #mod updates channel in the starsector discord too
21:55:33 <Phearlock> It's been purged of .8 mods and now only updating with .9 compatible stuff
21:55:48 <DuB`> Aha
22:01:54 <Camail> the fun of early access modding
22:03:11 <Camail> also spaceX just got authorized to launch an ass-load of satellites, dunno what % of total satellites it is, but that's neat
22:03:44 <Phearlock> Yeah the post-patch scramble for modders to update their shit
22:03:51 <Phearlock> Also whoo space
22:03:58 <Camail> so much space
22:04:01 <Camail> entirely too much
22:04:11 <Camail> but you greedy spacers won't stop until everything is space
22:04:18 <Camail> i can already feel the space closing in
22:04:24 <Zounds> how you doing Crisium 
22:04:30 <Crisium> oof
22:04:32 <Crisium> i am here
22:05:04 <Phearlock> Camail really leaning into the inners vs belter space people division
22:05:28 <Camail> I CAN'T GROW CORN ON SPACE
22:05:31 <DuB`> I bet he's all SHORT because of eartg gravity, too
22:05:32 <Camail> HOW WILL I LIVE
22:06:26 <Phearlock> Just recycle the corn
22:06:38 <Phearlock> Eat the same corn
22:06:42 <Phearlock> over and over again
22:09:08 <Zounds> that bad cris
22:14:14 <Crisium> lol Zounds
22:14:21 <Crisium> i just mean i didnt realize i signed in here

22:24:05 <DuB`> Phearlock I don't know whether to bless you for letting me know that the Perfect Game exists or curse you for the fact that I've spent a solid 30+ hours on it since friday afternoon :P
22:24:59 <DuB`> I'm just glad I got through last week's exams before finding out about it!
22:25:10 <Phearlock> Starsector is amazing yes
22:25:44 <Phearlock> So many hours lost
22:25:48 <Phearlock> but well spent
22:26:07 <DuB`> I was about to say "*well spent" instead of lost ;D
22:27:24 <DoT|Phone1> dub. it's cold
22:28:10 <DuB`> srs
22:28:29 <Phearlock> You are correct dot
22:28:45 <DuB`> I wanted to wear my comfy half-pant sweats things but it's toooo ocold
22:35:30 <Crisium> the Perfect Game you say?
22:36:53 <Phearlock> It's hard to find a better space game for 15 dollarinos
22:36:55 <DuB`> For my space battle and fleet customization and exploration needs, yes :D
22:39:36 <DuB`> My only complaints after 30 hours or so have to do with variety and one-dimensional factions, but there are mods to enough to quintuple space/weapon/ship variety and a faction mod
22:41:08 <Phearlock> Yeah most mods will probably manage to do their barebones compatibility update by the end of december.
22:41:26 <Phearlock> Then we'll see if they make fancy new stuff with the new systems.
22:41:39 <Phearlock> Starsector modding community is pretty nice =)
23:01:15 <Cane> I saw Starsector got an update.
23:01:21 <Cane> I should get back into it.
