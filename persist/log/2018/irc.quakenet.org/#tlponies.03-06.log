23:02:27 <skrm> thankfully you have not met my evil twin brother
23:07:08 <skrm> DuB` did you finish skool already
23:10:06 <DuB`> Ye

23:19:22 <skrm> Can I play an elf character that is really two dwarfs in a trench coat?
23:19:29 <Dot`> haha
23:19:45 <Dot`> and bio, i see mine going for about 3 more weeks
23:19:53 <Dot`> could be 2... but i doubt it
23:20:00 <skrm> my name is elf elfington and how about them trees ay
23:20:19 <Dot`> how huggable are them trees elf sir?
23:20:25 <skrm> we gon' kill the big baddie and then get TPKd by 3 goblins
23:20:39 <skrm> fuckin' love me some nature Dot` 
23:20:56 <skrm> lets frolick and talk about shoes
23:20:56 <Dot`> all them tlaking birds
23:21:03 <skrm> hah
23:21:29 <DuB`> Well I just found a 100-page sourcebook about the DESERT
23:21:47 <Camail> is it filled with sand
23:21:52 <Dot`> what kind of desert?
23:21:56 <Camail> arctic
23:22:02 <DuB`> The Anauroch one
23:22:12 <Camail> i was close, phonetically
23:22:20 <skrm> very good
23:22:56 <Camail> skram the dwarf-elf would get two attacks at lvl 1, but 8 dex
23:23:18 <skrm> DuB` wants to be a bedouin
23:23:23 <skrm> that sounds rad cam
23:23:24 <Camail> probably 6 dex
23:23:27 <skrm> still
23:23:30 <Camail> 2
23:23:33 <Camail> -5 dex
23:23:56 <skrm> heck yeah
23:24:17 <Camail> also strength doesnt add any attack bonuses
23:25:08 <Dot`> constant balance checks for top dorf

23:25:44 <Dot`> skram https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/8225or/what_was_the_bear_situation/
23:26:19 <Dot`> i love dorf fort patch notes
23:26:55 <skrm> they're pretty great
23:29:00 <Camail> doot doot
23:29:07 <Camail> would you like to spar
23:29:56 <reification> aha the no1 sym is now streaming :D 
23:30:01 <reification> time to learn stuff
23:34:35 <skrm> My favorite part is that they dont really say what they've done about it
23:34:58 <Dot`> i dont tihnk so cam, i didnt even get around to practicing today
23:35:01 <skrm> like Humans in Farming houses are naked
23:35:07 <Dot`> but i continue to try fix my sleep schedule
23:36:29 <Dot`> Does Trump go through a lot more staff than previosu presidents or does the news just enjoy reporting it?
23:37:13 <Camail> both
23:37:29 <Crisium> defnitely both
23:37:40 <Crisium> media has a super hate boner for him tho
23:37:57 <Dot`> BBC seems to have a breaking news of another firing/leaving every few days
23:38:04 <Camail> its less a hate boner and more that its profitable to scrutinize 
23:38:05 <Dot`> and for all i know it may just be standard practice
23:38:10 <Camail> also everything he says is a lie or retarded
23:38:50 <Camail> its very popular to hate him, so that's where the entertainment industry goes
23:39:22 <Crisium> its only part profit
23:39:40 <Crisium> they definitely feel a moral obligation to report on him more than other news happening
23:42:42 <Camail> they go too far and a fraction of the stories are just people trying really hard to make him look incompetent
23:42:58 <Camail> Dot`  what you havent heard is that there are MANY positions he has yet to appoint anyone to, at all
23:43:06 <Camail> no one was fired, they were never hired
23:43:25 <Camail> THAT still doesn't get enough coverage, we still don't have a ton of ambassadors 
23:43:34 <Dot`> lol
23:45:26 <Crisium> oh crap Gary Cohn resigned
23:45:29 <Camail> in december there were still 33 out of 100 vacancies
23:45:45 <Crisium> gonna be bad day for the stock market tomorrow lol
23:45:48 <Camail> was he indicted too?
23:45:52 <Camail> i just assume they all are
23:46:23 <Crisium> huh, what are you talking about
23:47:06 <Crisium> he was the economic advisor, played a huge part in the tax reform
23:47:18 <Crisium> but resigned because he opposes the tariffs
23:47:23 <Crisium> so this  means they are coming
23:47:29 <Crisium> which is usually not good for the economy
23:47:37 <DuB`> I haven't seen anyone NOT opposing them >_>
23:47:40 <Camail> oh fuck
23:48:00 <Camail> trump mistook SK president for NK dictator in an interview a bit ago
23:48:10 <Dot`> HAHA
23:48:11 <Camail> that's probably the worst one I've seen in awhile
23:48:20 <Camail> http://theweek.com/speedreads/759197/phone-call-trump-said-north-korean-regime-actually-south-koreas-president
23:51:27 <Runbunny> What a guy.
23:51:47 <Dot`> Runbun, why are you still awake?
23:51:53 <Dot`> you feeling better yet?
