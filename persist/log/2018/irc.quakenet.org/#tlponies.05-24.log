19:22:32 <Camail> i actually bought an smg yesterday
19:22:42 <Camail> and it worked out well
19:23:23 <Camail> but it pigeon holes me even more into fights around buildings
19:23:46 <Camail> which i'm fine with
19:24:02 <Camail> bio are you prepared for the criticalest of roles
19:26:06 <Camail> hip fire is still pretty inaccurate but it's good enough for when your close
19:26:41 <Zounds> which one did you get?
19:30:28 <Zounds> assuming you remember the name of the weird and wonderful vanu tech
19:30:29 <Camail> umm, the one with the biggest number i could find, can't recal which
19:31:01 <Camail> Canis
19:31:19 <Zounds> oh that one is decent
19:31:22 <Zounds> quite new
19:31:37 <Zounds> at release the unstable ammo attachment was hugely OP but they nerfed it since then
19:31:53 <Zounds> It ramps up its rate of fire over time
19:32:33 <Camail> the gimmick of increasing fire rate is meh to me, i was just looking at damage values at 10m, but i did notice it works well with heavy assault being alive the longest
19:32:53 <CockRoach|42> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb3VC_4n_E0
19:32:54 <Zounds> yeah the fire rate thing isn't really practical on an smg
19:33:03 <Camail> the increase is from 550 to 667, which is only like 20%
19:35:24 <Zounds> all classes can use SMG which is good value for the certs
19:35:37 <Zounds> Heavy and infil make the best use of them though imo
19:36:19 <Zounds> Unless it's the NCs Cyclone then any class is good with that thing since it's real good

20:53:49 <Runbunny> A lot of people hating on it though
20:54:14 <Zounds> That is true of almost anything these days
20:54:44 <Runbunny> People was just hoping for a remake
20:55:22 <Zounds> I was hoping for Dark Souls at 60fps without a 3rd party patch
20:55:31 <Zounds> 60+
20:57:29 <Runbunny> That's there.
20:57:45 <Runbunny> it feels to me that it runs better than dsfix
