00:04:42 <Dot> thast why this is noteworthy
00:30:44 <Camail> the division got an update
00:31:14 <Camail> i kinda wish i got into that game more, but not really?
00:31:55 <Camail> there's cool stuff but i didnt want to put in the time
00:32:14 <Camail> and as soon as i learned that there were 6 piece sets i basically lost interest
00:32:33 <Camail> i really cant stand how boring grinding for a predetermined full set is
00:33:52 <DuB`> Yup
00:34:11 <DuB`> Just fell asleep for 20 miinutes no worries >_>
00:34:21 <Camail> ur an old man
00:34:33 <Camail> aren't you supposed to be watching an owl, or something
00:34:38 <DuB`> Yes
00:34:43 <Camail> hoot hoot
00:34:44 <DuB`> Full of pizza and sleepiness
00:34:48 <DuB`> Couldn't fight it
00:34:57 <Camail> RIP
00:35:05 <Camail> thats why you gotta hang upside down
00:35:10 <Camail> get the blood from your stomach to your head
00:35:56 <DuB`> Hmm
00:36:07 <DuB`> I don't have an upside-down-hanging-apparatus
01:01:09 <Dot> excuses
01:12:34 <DuB`> HuK earning some serious OWL respect as a coach
01:24:23 <Camail> and he can still win an sc2 FFA
01:24:32 <Camail> which is important for ow managers
01:24:48 <DuB`> Of course
01:30:29 <Camail> i like how tracer didnt even need to get any of those kills
01:30:38 <Camail> just yell real loud and make thme turn aorund
01:31:05 <Camail> there's a very similar peaking style in csgo
