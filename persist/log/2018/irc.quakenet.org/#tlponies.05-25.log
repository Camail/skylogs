22:18:35 <Phearlock> I think that was an improvement. I got caught by your neutral jump jc a few times. I am not used to using anti air. =D
22:18:46 <Camail> i dropped soooo many combos
22:18:48 <Phearlock> ye
22:18:53 <Phearlock> Me too =3
22:19:04 <Camail> not really
22:19:22 <Camail> well, you're drops didnt mater as much because they still left you close
22:19:33 <Camail> you need to super more
22:19:38 <Camail> just add it tot he end of the combo
22:19:41 <Phearlock> The damage was fine but I often have issues getting them to end in super or qcf-c
22:19:51 <Camail> supering early is totally fine
22:20:05 <Phearlock> And yeah I totally need to super more.
22:20:13 <Camail> i miss out on a ton of damage because i super like 1-2 cycles early
22:20:27 <Camail> but supers give you a hard knockdown
22:20:32 <Phearlock> Yes
22:20:42 <Phearlock> Qcf-c as well
22:20:55 <Camail> is that the air grab
22:20:57 <Phearlock> xyeah
22:21:05 <Camail> if so, it doesn't necessarily hard kncockdown
22:21:12 <Camail> i teched it a bunch of times
22:21:33 <Camail> maybe only early in the combo
22:21:47 <Camail> because as an ender, it doesn't hard knockdown
22:21:54 <Phearlock> hm
22:22:30 <Camail> its kinda similar to my anti air, it will stagger you, but you can only have 1 stagger in a combo so if i command grab i can't use the kiss as a mix up
22:22:51 <Camail> also i learned a bunch of offense right before i quit and i forgot allll of it
22:22:59 <Phearlock> rip
22:23:03 <Camail> if only i had an unseeable air dash
22:23:14 <Phearlock> Tian is pretty unfair
22:23:19 <Camail> especially online
22:23:39 <Phearlock> mhm
22:24:22 <Camail> also now you realize just how bad my j.c is for air to air
22:24:40 <Camail> i basically NEED to catch you while you are in the first second of flying or else i just lose out
22:25:09 <Camail> and you always jump back to get into the air so i can't use any of my horizontal attacks to punish the aggression
22:25:16 <Camail> it's definitely a puzzle I'm still solving
22:26:08 <Phearlock> Super jumping more is pretty safe for now. I have a lot of issues with hitting targets that end up above me.
22:26:15 -!- Golly [~Golly@1.92-221-121.customer.lyse.net] has joined #tlponies
22:26:25 <Phearlock> Have to land and anti-air
22:26:45 <Camail> it's hard to gauge if an aa is appropriate
22:27:01 <Phearlock> I haven't had much chance to practice anti air
22:27:04 <Camail> because if you're in the scramble it would almost be better to block
22:27:24 <Camail> anti airs aren't as fast as j.a so it's risky
22:27:29 <Phearlock> yeah
22:28:38 <Camail> i think your basic gameplan is smart you have a very specific range where you go hyper defensive which is probably good,  it might be able to be abused tho
22:29:21 <Phearlock> I really like the range where I can airdash in and hit someone but their basic neutrals can't reach me.
22:29:45 <Camail> and paprika has 0 ways to really deal with that
22:29:49 <Camail> all the zoners can handle it
22:30:10 <Camail> part of it is that i forgot how to alpha counter
22:30:54 <Camail> but yea 90% of those matches were you airdashing in and me trying a bunch of stuff to counter it
22:31:15 <Phearlock> I feel that's a lot of characters response to Tianhuo.
22:32:10 <Camail> in general, she's a rushdown character, but i think it can look different in various ways
22:32:37 <Camail> I've dealt with flyers in other fighting games, air footsies is a thing
22:33:06 <Camail> right now you get in the air and either stall in the same place, or commit to an attack, occasionally doing an empty jump but VVERY rarely
22:33:12 <Camail> and there's certainly other ways to use fly
22:33:45 <Phearlock> Yeah I feel I should also just regular jump in a lot more.
22:34:02 <Phearlock> As keeping the air dash and flight cancel available like that is pretty handy sometiems.
22:34:31 <Phearlock> But my brain is impatient and wants to go fast.
22:34:48 <Phearlock> and it's also pretty safe to airdash in and jc even if they block it v0v
22:35:15 <Phearlock> At least online =P
22:35:51 <Camail> nah that's pretty universal, i imagine it's plus on block, cuz every other air move is
22:36:04 <Camail> the recovery frames are canceled by the landing animation
22:36:12 <Camail> it's a pretty universal fighting game thing
22:36:25 <Phearlock> And I can flight cancel and just jc again
22:36:43 <Camail> eh, that's not that valuable honestly
22:36:49 <Phearlock> No
22:36:50 <Phearlock> but it's fun
22:36:55 <Camail> its really easy to pushblock both, i felt fine when you were doing it
22:37:08 <Phearlock> I do need to do it less often
22:37:13 <Camail> doing j.a was pretty strong
22:37:23 <Phearlock> Yeah I have been trying to use it more.
22:37:40 <Camail> but i also think part of it is that I dont play this game enough, getting that much free pressure isn't real
22:37:54 <Camail> even in this game i am skeptical that the offense is tight enough
22:38:10 <Phearlock> It isn't airtight no
22:38:11 <Camail> occasionally i would jab through it, and if i labbed it i bet i could find holes
22:38:41 <Phearlock> Especially as I love to just flight jc from the ground which is absolutely unsafe.
22:38:46 <Camail> which ultimately, if it's unsafe pressure it's gonna get blown up hard, so having a back up plan is good
22:38:59 <Camail> which is where air footsies comes in to play, i'd guess
22:39:46 <Camail> but relying and air dashing in with an insanely high priority button is good, no reason to stop if they can't handle it
22:39:54 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:39:59 <Phearlock> Yeah it's been working out so far =P
22:39:59 <Camail> but if they can, you gotta have something else
22:40:23 <Phearlock> mhm
22:40:34 <Phearlock> So much learning to be doen still
22:40:42 <Camail> i cant imagine zoners having problems deal with that style tho
22:40:46 <Camail> dealing*
22:41:19 <Camail> it works against paprika because i have no threats at your best range, but a good oleander would never give you a chance to fly
22:41:27 <Phearlock> got to be more careful against them yeah.
22:41:44 <Phearlock> And have to find room to super jump vs ollie to get air time.
22:41:54 <Camail> also god do i hate charge characters, really wish she wasnt
22:41:56 <Phearlock> As otherwise yup just get hit
22:42:14 <Phearlock> Hey you don't have to stick to one character. the others are fun too.
22:42:22 <Phearlock> Been trying to learn some arizona on the side
22:42:37 <Phearlock> And none of those are my favorite pony analogues either!
22:42:49 <Camail> nope, gotta stick with it
22:42:56 <Camail> I'll bitch about it, but i gotta
22:42:57 <Phearlock> Ok <3
22:43:15 <Camail> i definitely need to play a match up that isn't as bad
22:44:05 <Camail> you're defense in neutral has gotten a lot better
22:44:20 <Phearlock> It feels like it =P
22:44:31 <Camail> still get kinda mashy when we're both close on the ground, but footsy range is hard
22:44:54 <Phearlock> I try to challenge a button too often when someone is in range of A
22:45:11 <Phearlock> "Yuuup should have just blocked"
22:45:14 <Camail> do you know about the concept of turns, and being plus or minus on block
22:45:31 <Phearlock> Not really D=
22:45:46 <Camail> it's a bit messy in games where normals cancel into each other, but the concept can still be applied
22:46:05 <Camail> basically, some normal allow for the user to recover quickly, lets say in 18 frames
22:46:14 <Camail> but the opponent block, and their blockstun is 20 frames
22:46:21 <Camail> so that move is +2
22:46:44 <Camail> that means if you both pressed A right when you get out of block stun, they would counter hit you
22:46:57 <Camail> so if they use a plus move, it's still there turn, you are still on defense
22:46:59 <Phearlock> block stun is the person blocking right?
22:47:01 <Camail> yea
22:47:12 <Camail> so A is typically the only plus move
22:47:26 <Camail> its short, fast, and plus
22:47:30 <Camail> another pretty universal constant
22:47:57 <Camail> so if your still on defense you should be looking to escape, not to challenge
22:48:15 <Camail> unless you know they have holes in their string, but that's contextual
22:48:38 <Camail> and even if a normal is minues, like my 2B is minus
22:48:59 <Camail> i can cancel that into 2C and frame trap
22:49:30 <Camail> a move being plus or minus is only measured in the context of pressing that single button, that 2B, and waiting until both characters are finished with their animation
22:49:54 <Camail> in this game, and many anime fighters, you can alter your recovery frames by canceling into a normal or a special move
22:49:56 <Phearlock> So if someone does 2a 2b only the 2b will count for being plus or minus?
22:50:08 <Camail> yea beacause its a part of the block string
22:50:14 <Phearlock> Blockstun doesn't carry over to the next move etc
22:50:19 <Phearlock> which is what I assume
22:50:21 <Camail> your current block stun is calcuated by whichever normal you last blocked
22:50:25 <Phearlock> right
22:51:30 <Camail> sometimes i would do 2a,2b and you would press 2b, but then i would press 2c and frame trap you
22:51:33 <Phearlock> Also I looked it up and yeah my air grab only hard knockdowns if the juggle bar isn't full.
22:52:21 <Camail> normally you are right to attack after i press 2b, because it a minus it is then your turn to fight, but thne i steal your turn by doing something risky by canceling into a move that is so minus that you can punish it
22:52:28 <Camail> yea i figured that was the trigger
22:53:56 <Phearlock> And yeah that all makes sense. I mean I'll still fall for it but that's just the risk working out.
22:54:01 <Phearlock> =D
22:54:14 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:54:20 <Camail> well that's just an example
22:54:24 <Phearlock> yeah
22:54:32 <Camail> there's a whole different game that can be played with these concepts
22:55:05 <Camail> and many people have brought them over from other games, and this game is so derivative of other fighting games, it's designed with these concepts in mind
22:56:37 <Camail> it'd be interesting if you risked a little during your offense where you are air dashing in and I am constantly pushblocking, to spend just half a second more to fly and cross me up
22:56:53 <Camail> that would be a strong tool to add
22:57:47 <Phearlock> I have done that a few times but it's hard to remember to do it.
22:57:56 <Phearlock> Never done it in our matches though
22:58:15 <Phearlock> It's a neat trick though yeah.
22:58:34 <Camail> You've crossed me up after doing a really high fly where you feel safe, but never during a scramble
22:58:43 <Phearlock> Mhm
22:59:09 <Phearlock> Like 90% of the times I've done it in matches against ppl it's been sort of by accident =P
23:00:12 <Camail> i wish i had a reversal DP, would solve every problem
23:00:19 <Phearlock> Will try remeber to practice it
