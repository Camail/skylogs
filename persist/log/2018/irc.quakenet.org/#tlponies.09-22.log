00:00:50 <DuB`> Now we can do custom games with low gravity and torb only and play the floor is lava!
00:01:04 <DuB`> Turn ult generation up to 500%
00:10:15 <Crisium> it is nice having it deploy to level 2 on its own for sure
00:10:30 <Crisium> and theres bound to be interesting setups for throwing it onto hi ground
00:10:53 <Crisium> its better offensively and worse defensively, also you lose the ability to constantly spam level 1 turrets just to draw aggro
00:11:01 <Crisium> seems like a good rework overall tho
00:11:53 <DuB`> yepyep
