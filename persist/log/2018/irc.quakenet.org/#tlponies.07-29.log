00:34:48 <Dot> though its really weird discord is being so useless
00:35:55 <Dot> it must just handle the data from multiple ppl really badly
00:37:15 <Cane> That would seem odd because that's its job.
00:37:23 <Dot> yea
00:37:40 <Dot> but we played Vermintide 2 for hours no issue
00:37:46 <Dot> even him , skram and I

16:05:51 <Runbunny> Hai Zounds.
16:05:59 <skram> No Cane, nor have I seen the results yet
16:06:02 <Runbunny> I think everyone is exploring some galaxy or some such
16:06:08 <skram> anything interesting happening?
16:06:11 <skram> hay zounds
16:07:12 <Runbunny> I'm about to watch anime Jonas.
16:07:23 <skram> why
16:08:22 <Runbunny> Someone has to explore the depths of my depravity
16:16:00 <Zounds> How come so many are playing No Mans sky recently
16:16:18 <skram> it has multiplayer and was on sale
16:16:29 <Zounds> I see
16:16:44 <Zounds> I always heard the game was kinda shit and the developer was a lying weasel
16:17:03 <skram> true true
16:17:33 <skram> but its been two years and it has been patched to be pretty alright
16:17:34 <Cane> Zounds, true on launch. I think the game was mispriced and mismarketed.
16:17:39 <Cane> But to their credit they've been quietly working on it this whole time.
16:17:50 <Cane> So now it's at the level it should have been at on launch, and people seem to be enjoying it.
16:18:06 <Cane> Although the shoddy marketing and initial price still turns me off.
16:18:52 <Zounds> Ah well at least it's redeemed itself a little

16:19:08 <Zounds> I've been playing For Honor a bit recently it also had a shaky start
16:19:40 <Dot> NMS is still on sale for about a day and im really considering it
16:19:43 <Dot> i liek space
16:19:48 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvAwB7ogkik is still my favorite thing from NMS.
16:20:37 <Zounds> I've never been one for space exploration games
16:21:03 <Zounds> Spacefighters can be good though, gimmie some X-Wing or TIE Fighter
16:21:12 <Cane> I'm probably the only person you've ever met who's played the actual precursor to No Man's Sky.
16:21:20 <Zounds> Star Wars Galaxies jump to lightspeed expansion was great
16:21:29 <Cane> So I like dry space exploration stuff.
16:23:07 <CockRoach|42> https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1014267515696922624
16:23:12 <Phearlock> You ever did Freespace 2 Zounds?
16:23:37 <Phearlock> If you were a Xwing & Tie fighter fan that's a good one to play.
16:25:15 <skram> I generally dislike open ended games like this but multiplayer makes it
16:25:25 <skram> easier to find stupid goals when you have a buddy
16:25:45 <Phearlock> I've had a lot of issues making the missions work in MP
16:26:07 <Phearlock> But having MP in general is pretty neat
16:26:30 <skram> havent had any so far
16:26:45 <skram> but we did have a weird desync bug when we went into the instanced space station
16:28:38 <Phearlock> Freighter assault misson doesn't seem to work at all. Data stealing missions complete as successful even if you fail them.
16:28:50 <Phearlock> And if you succeed it plays the mission success and fail messages. =P

18:25:50 <skram> its surprisingly immersive

18:28:21 <Camail> gotta progress in the base quests to get the blueprints
18:29:52 <Camail> also i found a derelict ship with 34 slots, so i repaired it an i'm slowly repairing the slots
18:30:12 <skram> i only got the big container
18:30:27 <Camail> yea they are big containers, but there are 10 of those
18:30:44 <Camail> you can stack them like shipping containers
18:31:16 <skram> it says 1 per base??
18:31:25 <Camail> one of each unique container
18:31:35 <Camail> that's why they have separate blueprints

18:32:06 <skram> i thought i was pretty deep in the whole base building quest thing but i guess not
