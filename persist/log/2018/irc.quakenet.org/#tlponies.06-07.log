02:16:16 <DuB`> !!!!!!!!!!
02:16:29 <Crisium> go dragons go
02:18:42 <DuB`> Geguri 25-1 on lijiang
02:23:59 <Bio> are you ready
02:24:07 <Bio> for the ultimate disapointment?
02:24:20 <Bio> map 5 loss inc
02:24:29 <DuB`> LONG LIVE GEGURI
02:26:17 <DuB`> where were u when shanghai was WIN
02:28:27 <DuB`> GEGOOREEEEE
02:28:51 <Crisium> Geguri bomb
02:28:54 <Crisium> this is the hype
02:28:55 <Crisium> its happening
02:33:02 <Bio> i wonder
02:33:14 <Bio> if anyone will care after they get win 1
02:33:20 <Bio> probably i guess
02:34:18 <Crisium> nooo
02:34:23 <Bio> the meme tho
02:34:27 <Bio> W I N L E S S
02:34:51 <Bio> does geguri even play anything else
02:35:03 <Crisium> dva, zarya, brigette
02:35:18 <Crisium> but shanghai doesnt run rein much so she rarely zaryas
02:36:57 <Camail> I've been thinking and watching a lot of dnd lately and i realized i am becoming fixated with characters being force to resolve a conflict. Where the character makes a choice and impacts the narrative.
02:37:04 <Camail> and i dont think you can do that in a module
02:37:25 <Bio> makes sense
02:37:27 <Camail> because then it kind of no longer follows that guideline, it's unstable
02:38:25 <Camail> you can keep the big bads and the end game the same, but literally nothing else matters if you can't build those decisions that truly give players the freedom of choice
02:39:06 <Camail> because the players can, and will really fuck things up. Whatever scale you put the choice at will derail as much as possible
02:41:19 <Camail> but rewatching the finale of vox machina, todays c team, and the last tm9 episode, the parts that i hold onto are the ones where a character is thrust into using their agency
02:42:07 <Camail> like percy, he had an internal, and mandatory, decision to make with the demon contract, and that changed his life forever. The tension building up be hind that decision made the resolution feel amazing
02:42:53 <Camail> this new medication is making me so talkative, but i think it's important
02:44:19 <Camail> I've really REALLY wanted to figure out what my dm style is and i think that's the kernel of it all, building problems that create narrative tension, and having then revolve around the players, forcing them up against a wall, forcing them to confront the problem or let it fall by the wayside for an even worse fate
02:44:40 <DuB`> Valuable for sure
02:44:59 <DuB`> How possible is that for non-pro DMs do ya think?
02:45:30 <Camail> i think it's just about writing the story
02:45:39 <Camail> matt's method is using backstory to engage the player
02:45:54 <Camail> i think that's interesting, but he's already doing that, there are other hooks
02:46:20 <Camail> as long as you make it relevant to the character it can be anything, as long as they have a stake in the "fight"
02:46:55 <Camail> like with your character in my game, you saw the elemental chaos when you died, and that was interesting, it was weird and unexplained, i could probably make that into a thing
02:47:41 <DuB`> Ya
02:48:05 <Camail> and there's two general categories that could go, trying to force her to accept that there are some powers you cant understand, or doubling down and searching for an answer
02:48:53 <Camail> either path will eventually hit a wall where she needs to decide, sure she can just avoid it, but if the world put her in a decision where she needs to either take a tome that looks related, or leave it and accept her limitation
02:49:44 <Camail> like, you can't avoid making a choice there, it's a binary decision that solves the conflict either way
02:50:04 <Camail> most players would probably take it, because more lore is yummy
02:50:51 <Camail> but maybe you decide that she's actually scared of the elements after that death, and that her whole life as an evocation wizard is now in question
02:51:08 <Camail> that's the kind of character crisis i want to create in my games
02:51:44 <Bio> dragons 0-10 on nepal
02:51:54 <Bio> the memes tho
02:52:00 <DuB`> Hope is faint
02:52:17 <DuB`> @Fissure: when i play of the match I'm not nervous. but this @ShanghaiDragons match nervous of me
02:52:21 <DuB`> Haha
02:53:02 <Camail> there were quite a few moments that i enjoyed in our campaign, I do want to run a game sometime this year
02:53:11 <DuB`> Nice!
02:54:52 <DuB`> I've been enjoying it, putting more work into my character made it a lot more fun
02:54:59 <DuB`> Even playing within module constraints
02:56:21 <Crisium> so about that shanghai win...
02:56:23 <Camail> modules are totally fine, honestly, I'd play a module as a player. Maybe even use the basic skeleton of a particular interesting one
02:57:30 <Bio> MEI-Hem
02:57:54 <Bio> EVERYTHING IS FALLING APAHT

03:19:47 <Bio> no lina this game, tinker mid
03:20:00 <Bio> secret may pick it
03:20:07 <Bio> actually nah, they need a 1
03:20:12 <DuB`> But I have to root AGAINST them!
03:20:35 <Bio> this tru
03:22:04 <DuB`> Wait
03:22:17 <DuB`> None of TL look like carries to me lol
03:22:20 <Camail> i think chris perkins does something very similar to matt, but instead of relying on story elements, he uses the character's recent actions to create consequences that generate problems for the players
03:22:47 <Bio> its a pretty midgame lineup for sure
03:23:11 <Bio> if it goes super long, PL will be an issue
03:23:47 <DuB`> Oh
03:23:56 <DuB`> Chris Perkins does the one anna prosser is in
03:24:01 <DuB`> I shud watch that
03:24:24 <Camail> yea, he's supposedly really brutal
03:24:52 <Camail> which give more credence to my reading of his style, he's all about letting players hang themselves with their actions
03:26:03 <Camail> "oh you did this? yea the problems solved, honestly" and it is, tension is relieved , but then he uses that to murder you later
03:27:32 <DuB`> Tusk is fun
03:27:34 <DuB`> Aghs pls
03:28:39 <Bio> donkey kick
03:30:35 <Bio> lol what a cluster this early game is
03:32:26 <Bio> once tinker gets bots
03:32:37 <Bio> its gonna be super hard for like 30 mins for secret
03:34:07 <Bio> they won't have any real good catch for tinker w/ blink
03:34:21 <Bio> maybe a lucky axe blink
03:40:37 <Bio> secret just can't fight 
03:40:41 <Bio> into march
03:49:10 <DuB`> this Miracle
03:49:11 <DuB`> rofl
03:49:17 <Bio> tinker is a hero
03:49:28 <DuB`> LOL
03:50:11 <Bio> game is VERY over
03:51:08 <DuB`> O_O
03:51:14 <DuB`> 30min game into 24min game
03:51:18 <DuB`> Wowee
03:51:28 <Bio> that was an outdraft
03:51:37 <Bio> literally nothing to answer tinker
03:54:30 <DuB`> Welp
03:54:37 <DuB`> Now no more liquidoto for 2 days :P
04:02:36 <Bio> p much

04:08:54 <DuB`> vp gud
04:12:29 <DuB`> Glad we got Uber + MrX for shanghai game
04:12:44 <DuB`> Uber might be the best caster I've heard in ANY game
04:13:16 <Bio> you mean
04:13:24 <Bio> you wouldn't want semmler for that match?
04:13:25 <Bio> lel
04:13:59 <DuB`> Sem+Hex have been much better this stage
04:14:13 <Bio> o
04:14:14 <Bio> well
04:14:24 <Bio> that was the first match i watched this stage so rip
04:14:28 <DuB`> Haha
04:14:41 <Bio> its just fun to rip on semmler
04:15:55 <Bio> io left open
04:16:03 <Bio> wat
04:16:49 <DuB`> wispyboi
04:17:20 <Bio> pretty sure io has been banned in like almost every match this tourn
04:18:10 <DuB`> DP boring indeed
04:18:32 <DuB`> Also gyro
04:18:33 <DuB`> zzz
04:19:02 <Bio> i'm hoping that vp have a plan for this
04:19:06 <Bio> this combo is pretty good
04:25:45 <DuB`> MORE tinka
04:25:54 <Camail> that guy in the middle needs a smaller suit
04:26:09 <Camail> pointy shoulders are so distracting
04:26:55 <Bio> yeh, he's lost a lot of weight recently
04:27:06 <DuB`> It seems to be a theme in doto for the desk analysts to seem half-asleep
04:27:13 <DuB`> Always so subdued lol
04:27:24 <Bio> the chat spam lel
04:27:29 <DuB`> Bahaha
04:27:39 <Camail> oh, that's cool. sometimes having big clothes is a good problem
04:27:53 <DuB`> ye good for him
04:29:12 <Camail> yipes from the fgc also got thin and it's crazy
04:29:27 <Camail> seems to be an age barrier where some people just get sick of being large and go hard on the diet
04:31:52 <Bio> i should be doing that while job searching
04:31:55 <Bio> not much else to do

13:00:32 <Bunny> What about you Henrik friend?
13:04:07 <Rawr|Fone> School is finished forever so everything is great
13:04:15 <Rawr|Fone> Tell me about your worries Anders
13:06:08 <Bunny> Well basically. Other people have reported that they have done some stuff with a certain efficiency, which I need to be able to replicate.
13:06:49 <Bunny> What if I can't? 
13:09:10 <Rawr|Fone> Well if they can, you can as well

15:06:34 <Zounds> though it's a bit less about anime softcore porn games and more to do with the schlock slapped together in 10 mins and put on steam
15:09:19 <reification> just need an asset flip tag and being able to block all games with it?
15:11:10 <Zounds> I guess something like that could help
15:11:20 <Zounds> I'm more on the buyer beware side of things
15:11:34 <Zounds> It's hard to come across that garbage if you're not looking for it already
15:11:47 <Zounds> but more information always helps
15:12:52 <reification> refund policy also helps

16:53:01 <Bunny> I'd wish.
16:55:14 <Bunny> When are you bringing me the skov kat you promised me Skram?
16:55:23 <Bunny> I'm very lonely.
16:55:54 <skram> You dont bring a skog katt anywhere, Anders
16:56:04 <skram> They come to your house if you are worthy
16:57:05 <Bunny> They don't even live in this country.

17:00:59 <Bunny> Like how it used to be in Tivoli.
17:03:11 <Bunny> The early evening sun is reaching the window where I sit. I might be on fire.
17:08:44 <skram> get some particle boards
17:08:53 <skram> block that stupid window
17:09:57 <Bunny> Then I can't enjoy the view though :/
17:10:20 <skram> just get a nice wallpaper on your desktop
17:10:22 <Bunny> Dot dot.
17:10:27 <Bunny> oh
17:10:32 <Bunny> That's a great idea.
17:10:55 <Bunny> Except I can't really go full degenerate since I have to show stuff to my spervisor from time to time :/
17:12:21 <Zounds> Why not get a non degenerate but still nice wallpaper
17:18:00 <Bunny> But zounds...

20:39:34 <Bunny> What a fine mess this turned out to be.
20:39:49 <Zounds> there's also the huntsman

20:48:13 <Bunny> I'm so tired.
20:48:16 <Camail> he's probably reading
20:48:29 <Camail> well, you stopped running, you should be tired
20:48:35 <Camail> that was years of nonstop running
20:48:40 <Bunny> Luckily I can go home in like 10 minutes.
20:48:43 <skram> well tell him to stop reading
20:48:57 <skram> anders its almost midnight why are you at work
