01:28:05 <Crisium> i love doing 60%+ damage myself to Orisa barrier as a support, and its still up
01:28:23 <Bio> needs more bastion
01:28:26 <Crisium> if only my 2dps and tanks would help combine to a fraction of my output and we could kill it
01:28:29 <Bio> remove barrier
01:28:50 <Crisium> the 5 of them combined need to only do 2/3 of what i do
01:28:52 <Crisium> but they cannot
01:29:00 <Crisium> if they got picks around the shield i would understand
01:29:01 <Crisium> they did not
01:29:08 <Crisium> they just choose to not hold left click
01:29:53 <Crisium> zen alone can bring down Orisas shield in exactly the cooldown, so in effect she can keep it up forever.  so if 1-2 people help me, we can keep it down
