00:00:08 <skram> i dont believe on tortoises
00:00:36 <skram> also theres a fox outside my window screaming but its hiding in the tall grass somewhere
00:01:15 <Dot> ive been in england 3 years and no fox sightings :(
00:01:27 <skram> they're pretty shy
00:01:36 <Dot> i saw a badger
00:01:39 <Dot> that was nice
00:01:50 <skram> dont fuck with it
00:01:51 <Dot> also nice it wasnt in south africa
00:01:56 <Dot> i would be dead
00:02:05 <Dot> Honey badgers are rather grouchy
00:02:30 <skram> do honey badgers hunt lions
00:02:58 <Dot> not so much hunt as attack if the lion is in its way
00:03:38 <skram> bit nicer than european badgers though

00:03:51 <skram> no wait the other way around
00:04:07 <Dot> nah, British badgers are docile if deseas ridden
00:04:15 <Dot> though*
00:04:33 <Dot> Honey badgers are smart and visious
00:04:39 <Dot> vicious*
00:05:08 <skram> european badgers are not smart but can be viscious

00:16:27 <Bio> helo 
00:16:29 <Bio> i had dinner
00:16:32 <Bio> and now i'm back
00:16:47 <Dot> wb
00:16:53 <skram> bio lad
00:16:57 <skram> what did you have for dinner
00:17:02 <Bio> some fish taco
00:17:08 <Bio> nice tilapia
00:19:19 <skram> bio didnt get any meat either Dot
00:19:22 <skram> whats going on
00:19:37 <Bio> its ok skrm
00:19:41 <Bio> i choes this life
00:19:55 <Bio> i've got lots of meat based meals to cook actually
00:20:14 <skram> what kind of fish is tilapia anyway
00:20:36 <Bio> Tilapia (/tɪˈlɑːpiə/ tih-LAH-pee-ə) is the common name for nearly a hundred species of cichlid fish from the tilapiine cichlid tribe. Tilapia are mainly freshwater fish inhabiting shallow streams, ponds, rivers and lakes and less commonly found living in brackish water. Historically, they have been of major importance in artisanal fishing in Africa, and they are of increasing importance in aquaculture and aquapo
00:20:36 <Bio> nics. Tilapia can become a problematic invasive species in new warm-water habitats such as Australia,[2] whether deliberately or accidentally introduced, but generally not in temperate climates due to their inability to survive in cold water.
00:20:44 <Bio> ez
00:20:50 <Bio> its a white flesh fish
00:21:03 <skram> so its basically cod
00:21:08 <Bio> ye

00:30:37 <Dot> gnight reef
00:31:07 <Camail> kingdom come is a good game that is somewhat pretty
00:31:10 <Camail> but eurojank
00:32:25 <Camail> vermintide 2 maybe
00:32:41 <Camail> its a mob game so that can make any card churn
00:33:09 <Camail> far cry 5 was a far cry game, not bad, and the definition of AAA
00:44:06 <skram> ooh maybe ill do that

18:23:59 <Camail> i have a +10 nayzaga axe now, it's so big
18:24:27 <Camail> it's like nayzaga was designed for axes, energized and health on hit
18:32:34 <Dot> haha incontrol
18:33:24 <Dot> snute :/
18:33:27 <Dot> so tilted
18:34:08 <Runbunny> Are you going to play greatsword in monter hunter world Camail?
18:34:24 <Camail> i dunno, gonna have to try everything
18:34:36 <Camail> greatsword isnt as strong as the axe in this game
18:34:47 <Camail> also it doesnt have the same powering up mechanic, or the same strings
18:36:54 <Runbunny> Yeah the stacking buff probably isn't there.
18:40:56 <Runbunny> Dot, Rawr|Phone https://i.imgur.com/NLpQn6h.mp4
18:41:12 <Camail> there's a lot of little differences, the biggest one being how long hunts are
18:41:28 <Camail> i know for sure i dont want to use dual blades
18:42:06 <Camail> gunlance looks cool, insect glaive looks cool, switch axe looks cool

20:50:46 <Crisium> hay hay
21:22:07 <Cane> Out of curiosity, at what point does an extra dialogue mod just turn into fanfiction?
21:24:42 <Phearlock> Never thought about it like that
21:26:36 <Dot> haha
21:26:44 <Phearlock> Probably when it starts to add its own sidequests and characters.
21:26:48 <Dot> and yay parting <3
21:27:08 <Phearlock> I really like fanfiction
21:27:18 <Phearlock> ...depending on the quality of course
21:27:55 <Cane> Good, I'm currently not writing fanfiction then. Not that I was worried.
21:29:38 <skram> as long as you dont put a dang romance arc into it cane
21:30:55 <Phearlock> Put a romance arc in it
21:31:02 <Cane> Sorry skram, Phear has spoken.
21:34:29 <Dot> i hope its STALKER fanfiction cane
21:35:44 <Cane> I refuse to iindulge in the Freedom x Bloodsucker meme just yet.
21:39:05 <Cane> Dot, random question, do you have a favorite piece of... art, comic, music, whatever to come out of the STALKER series?
21:40:06 <Dot> thats a tough one, hmmmm
21:40:16 <Cane> Yeah I know.
21:40:20 <Cane> I mean, http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/856/438/e1c.jpg is pretty great.
21:40:33 <Dot> hahaha
21:41:11 <Cane> Possibly the most memorable for me though is just Dirge for the Planet. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTHhYf2rx3w

21:46:49 <Dot> while i am now stuck looking/listening to stalker things
21:47:42 <Dot> but really cane cane you beat the ingame guitar as far as stalker music goes
21:48:09 <Cane> I know... I've played the game for ages and I still stop by campfires and listen.
21:48:23 <Cane> A nice break from the somber world of the zone.
21:50:19 <Dot> Crisium reification https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ShadyWhirlwindKestrel-mobile.mp4
21:50:24 <Dot> whats happend to OW?
21:50:35 <Crisium> im playing as him right now
21:50:37 <Crisium> hes insane
21:50:44 <Cane> I KNEW that would happen the second I saw that ability. <3
21:51:04 <Dot> i love and hate it
21:51:04 <Crisium> like hes not overpowered, just crazy designed
21:51:14 <Cane> Yeah he's just nuts.
21:51:23 <Cane> I think people just love playing him for the mobility.
21:51:27 <Crisium> hes an ult battery like roadhog, but he can do things that no one else could ever do before
21:51:30 <Cane> I can't hate, because from what I've seen he doesn't have any stuns.
21:51:35 <Crisium> and yeah he has the best rollouts in the game, like as good or better than lucio
21:51:38 <Cane> We have waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many stuns and disables in OW. It's part of why I stopped playing.
21:51:46 <Crisium> he has a pushback, but no stun
21:51:49 <Crisium> so he can boop
21:51:55 <Cane> This is just a super mobile hero with boop capabilities.
21:51:57 <Cane> I'm fine with that.
21:52:22 <Dot> i saw a gif of him swinging under and back capping that was great
21:52:27 <Dot> but i dont knwo map names anymore
21:53:07 <Crisium> on kings ro
21:53:09 <Crisium> row
21:53:17 <Dot> yea, think so
21:54:37 <Crisium> Can you heard about the sombra rework?
21:54:40 <Crisium> Cane*
21:55:06 <Dot> so i didnt find the gif i was lookign for but wow there is a lot of wrecking ball gifs on OW reddit
21:55:20 <Cane> No Crisium, what's the score?
21:55:48 <Crisium> https://blizztrack.com/patch_notes/overwatch_ptr
21:55:52 <Crisium> mix of buffs and nerfs
21:56:00 <Crisium> the top sombras are saying its a nerf overall sadly
21:56:22 <Cane> Ooh. Hmm.
21:56:38 <Cane> I think I'll miss playing around the translocator. It forces you to think about when to use it.
21:56:53 <Cane> There was a tempo to Sombra that I quite liked.
21:57:32 <Cane> Stealth in the perfect spot, time down, translocate in the window above, I have 15 seconds to uncloak and do my thing, hack tank or healer while telling the team to go...
21:58:12 <Cane> She'll still be fine though.
