10:47:32 <skrm> Its a bit exciting, some danish people with dynamite are here too doing a racket
10:47:43 <Dot> thats how chernobyl failed!
10:47:52 <Dot> Danish ppl
10:48:24 <skrm> Nyet, chernobyl failed because the USSR didnt give their dudes the proper documentation and because they were doing stupid tests
10:48:31 <skrm> im a professional, trust me
10:49:47 <skrm> The only proper way to knock buildup from furnace walls is throwing dynamite sticks inside and hoping it hits the right spot
