01:24:34 <Camail> pls
01:24:46 <Camail> Phearlock i can fight if you want to
01:24:52 <Camail> i have not played in...a long time
01:26:00 <Phearlock> I've still not managed to drill any optimal combos and have mostly fought velvets and ollies. =D
01:26:12 <Phearlock> So I wouldn't worry
01:26:14 <Camail> steam says 2 months
01:26:26 <Camail> so if you're up to it i can fite
01:27:05 <Phearlock> Yeah sure, I'll idle in the Official 1 pixel lobby
01:30:41 <Camail> i was in there and didnt see anyone
01:31:01 <Phearlock> shit 4
01:31:04 <Camail> kk
01:31:06 <Phearlock> my bad xD
01:31:12 <Camail> i saw 1 was in 4 :P
01:31:26 <Phearlock> xD
01:35:07 <Camail> it's a dirty trick

01:58:20 <Phearlock> I'm still amazed at how well you hitconfirm into damage on getting any sort of hit off =D
02:02:26 <Camail> i keep getting you with that
02:08:43 <Phearlock> You keep not getting pushblocked very far even when you jump, paprika is scary
02:13:00 -!- Dot [~quassel@90.197.149.26] has joined #tlponies
02:38:10 <Camail> my jump heavy is multi hit
02:38:14 <Phearlock> Do I have to wait until all the hits are over to pushblock your multi hit?
02:38:57 <Camail> so if you pushblock in tyhe middle i dont move
02:39:02 <Camail> gotta be at the end of the move
02:39:11 <Phearlock> Shit
02:39:15 <Phearlock> =D
02:46:07 <Phearlock> What sort of move is kiss again? It doesn't seem blockable =D
02:46:12 <Camail> COMMAND GRAB
02:46:15 <Camail> caps lul
02:46:16 <Phearlock> ew
03:00:02 <Camail> my jump light are baiting the pushjblock btgw
03:03:30 <Phearlock> huh what determines if you 2a gets pushblocked or not?
03:04:57 <Phearlock> Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
03:05:08 <Camail> umm
03:05:12 <Camail> if you do it fast enough?
03:05:25 <Phearlock> huh
03:10:55 <Phearlock> I love those empty jumps on wakeup
03:23:15 <Phearlock> So err, how do you actually prevent the kiss command grab?
03:23:18 <Camail> jump
03:23:24 <Phearlock> huh
03:23:25 <Camail> command grabs can only be avoided in the air
03:31:02 <Bio> oh man
03:31:11 <Bio> fuckin had a struggle bus of a zeus game
03:31:22 <Bio> 65 min feed fest for me, carried by a specter
03:31:41 <Phearlock> Hahahaha the worst divekick
03:31:46 <Phearlock> whoops =D
03:32:34 <Bio> ok
03:32:37 <Bio> phear
03:32:50 <Bio> i just laned against a dude who's ranked 511 in dota
03:32:58 <Bio> I feel much less bad about losing mid to him
03:39:49 <Phearlock> Nice one bio =D
03:42:34 <Phearlock> Picnic drop
03:42:37 <Phearlock> =D
03:42:47 <Bio> man
03:42:51 <Bio> and I only lost the lane
03:43:01 <Bio> because someone took courier with my bottle on it
03:43:15 <Bio> would have been able to win the 1v1 i barely lost with the regen
03:43:32 <Bio> but dying put me behind so much he killed me like 3 more times
03:44:04 <Bio> I did not think that I'd be queueing into people ranked so high
03:47:23 <Micen|Droid> You competing at the internationals when Bio? 
03:54:26 <Bio> idk
03:54:29 <Bio> gotta find a team
03:54:32 <Bio> i strimmed
03:54:35 <Bio> alltp
03:54:42 <Bio> i'll stream tomorrow morning if u up
03:54:48 <Bio> cut my time down under 4h
03:54:52 <Bio> or a little over
03:54:56 <Bio> something like that
03:57:02 <Phearlock> Aaaah the 2a
03:57:09 <Camail> dont do the ball thing on wake up
03:57:17 <Camail> you cant even punish the command grab that you avoid
03:57:26 <Camail> just do a dormal jump
03:57:29 <Camail> normal*
03:57:35 <Phearlock> But 2a is scary
03:59:57 <Camail> 2a beats that
04:04:01 <Phearlock> yeah ok
04:04:05 <Phearlock> jumping op
04:21:41 <Camail>  you never tech out of the corner
04:21:49 <Camail> that's pretty important vs paprika
04:22:20 <Camail> vs anyone, really
04:22:32 <Phearlock> My mind also can't quite grasp that no matter where I get hit with jc you get a string off of it
04:23:04 <Phearlock> I think not blocking low after blocking jc is just due to it being 6am mind
04:23:10 <Phearlock> I keep thinking it but not doing it
04:23:14 <Phearlock> =D
04:23:49 <Phearlock> Thanks a bunch for the games though.
04:23:54 <Phearlock> Was fun
04:24:22 <Camail> yea if the last hit of jc hits then i can hit confirm from pretty much anywhere
04:24:33 <Camail> yea, fun times
04:25:08 <Camail> but yea the number one thing to fix is to tech better
04:25:38 <Camail> one of the easy crutches to use is the fact that every combo ends in a knockdown
04:25:40 <Phearlock> As in, just tech in place always? =D
04:25:44 <Camail> so youe can mash tech the entire time
04:25:58 <Camail> pick a direction and mash the entire time you are getting hit
04:26:04 <Camail> then react to when your character techs
04:26:25 <Camail> thats how i was getting out of your combos so quickly
04:26:59 <Phearlock> Still trying to get my combos clean enough for that =P
04:27:06 <Camail> also teching forward to escape the corner, nothing is worse in a fighting game than being in the corner
04:27:44 <Camail> your combos are good enough, if you feel like you cant do the full string just end a cycle early with a super
04:27:48 <Camail> like i do
04:27:55 <Camail> my combos are basic as fuck
04:28:21 <Camail> it's more important to be aware of where you want to tech so you dont just instantly lose when you're being cornered
04:29:00 <Camail> every single mix up that i did, other than the ones after super, could've been avoided with teching the other direction
04:29:02 <Phearlock> Honestly wasn't really thinking about that so much as practicing trying to block.
04:29:12 <Camail> that's when your getting hit tho
04:30:13 <Camail> regardless of what you were doing during that set, i got 90% of my offense because you teched poorly
04:30:26 <Camail> i only needed to win in the neutral like two times in a round
04:30:33 <Phearlock> Just gotten used to not teching out of the corner as it's usually way easier to block then =P
04:30:54 <Phearlock> And I kept getting hit in other matchups when doing it
04:31:00 <Camail> eh, if you know you're teching out then you know where to block
04:31:27 <Phearlock> I'll practice it more.'
04:31:46 <Phearlock> need to find more people who aren't ollies and velvets to play against regularly
04:32:30 <Phearlock> Getting in is easier than getting out hue =P
04:33:17 <Camail> tell that to my stubby normals
04:33:28 <Camail> its rough in neutral for paprika in that match up
04:33:35 <Phearlock> Yeah
04:33:36 <Camail> my only good normals dont hit you
04:33:57 <Phearlock> Your Jc outmatches almost anything I have except I think my jB at max range.
04:34:06 <Camail> only if i pre-empt it
04:34:15 <Phearlock> The move does stay out there for a long time =P
04:34:21 <Camail> you are misunderstanding priority and timing
04:34:27 <Camail> my normals have shit hitboxes
04:34:39 <Camail> but if i do it at the right time it stuffs your air move
04:34:53 <Camail> if i dont, you hit me, and your normals are waaaay faster
04:35:01 <Camail> a lot of the times i got hit in the air i had pressed jc
04:35:03 <Camail> you just didnt see it
04:35:20 <Phearlock> Mmm I see
04:35:24 <Camail> so i gotta guess what timing your using for fly cancels
04:35:37 <Camail> are you gonna instantly cancel flgiht into forward dash attack?
04:35:46 <Camail> are you gonna hover really high and get over me for the cross up?
04:35:56 <Camail> i have to make decisions that directly counter yours
04:36:11 <Camail> i have to react to your movement because it's so much better than what i can do
04:36:28 <Phearlock> Yah I do enjoy that.
04:36:35 <Phearlock> Wheeee mobility.
04:36:45 <Camail> it's a really awkward footsies duel
04:36:50 <Camail> and sometimes i manage to get the anti air
04:37:13 <Phearlock> Bunch of times I got hit by your overhead charge because I'm used to being able to fly upward really fast.
04:37:16 <Camail> but it's surprisingly easy for your character to avoid that hitbox
04:37:18 <Phearlock> they nerfed that recently =D
04:37:46 <Phearlock> Yeah anti airs aren't that scary as it's not too bad to just vary when to go in.
04:37:59 <Camail> i dont think you could really do anything if i do 2c xx 46c
04:38:08 <Camail> thats why it's so punishable on block
04:38:35 <Camail> as a trade-off for the long range frame trap
04:41:46 <Phearlock> I suspect the ball thing isn't as bad as I was using it. unless you crossup it does have 1 invul frame and I can flight cancel the later parts. But I kept double tapping the button.
04:42:04 <Phearlock> Which sends me way too high to do anything
04:42:37 <Phearlock> But yeah I was using it too much
04:44:19 <Camail> the ball thing probably has it's uses, just not on wake up
04:44:40 <Camail> unless you can fly cancel it or something
04:45:10 <Camail> but it does the same thing as a normal jump except it sends you really far away
04:45:30 <Phearlock> Yeah that's cause I was double tapping the button
04:45:45 <Phearlock> If I didn't fuck it up it wouldn't send me as far =P

16:24:52 <Runbunny> Too much water is pretty bad for you as well.
