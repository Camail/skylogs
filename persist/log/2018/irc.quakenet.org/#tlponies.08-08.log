00:19:41 <Camail> am watching*
00:20:55 <Bio> yarp

00:26:38 <Dot`> skram https://imgur.com/gallery/tpt6Jbh
00:36:16 <Dot`> cane, its a Gorge https://imgur.com/gallery/h5DmUd5
00:37:22 <skram> is this what it looks like when your halfling is running
00:37:55 <Dot`> did you see the dnd discord skram?
00:38:00 <skram> not yet
01:07:02 <skram> when are you getting a wolf dot
01:27:10 <Phearlock_> We're gonna try save some caravan and halfway through bio is going to go like "Can't let you do that, star-halfling" and then we'll have to fight a werewolf
01:27:28 <Phearlock_> If we beat it dot can ride it
01:33:51 <skram> what game are you doing ferlok :p
01:34:13 <Phearlock_> I mean that's a starfox reference but I haven't played it in years
02:15:54 <Camail> my nms save is so fucked up
02:16:13 <Camail> like royally fucked up, i think doing some of the quests in multiplayer messed with it
02:16:26 <Camail> think i'm done with that game
02:19:17 <skram> fucked up how?`
02:19:45 <Camail> missin progression is all messed up, nothing will properly update, some of it doesnt even exist
02:19:59 <Camail> and if i change the mission data my save reverts
02:20:07 <Camail> so i lose a bunch of stuff
02:20:38 <skram> :(
02:23:39 <Camail> after spending an hour digging, it's still to broken of a game for me to care
02:23:49 <Camail> and without a main story i have 0 interest
02:28:02 <Bio> How was evo cam
02:28:24 <Camail> it was great, exhausting but great
02:28:34 <Camail> fights were had, voices were lost
02:28:46 <Bio> did u scream with the dbz boys
02:30:07 <Camail> yea that was fun
02:30:59 <Camail> it was getting real boring to watch dbz tho
02:31:05 <Camail> games went so long
02:31:10 <Bio> I can see that
02:31:38 <Camail> combos are long and no damage is dealt
02:31:55 <Camail> and when it is, sparking recovers a full health bar, its rough
02:32:13 <Bio> think its something that can get patched
02:43:51 <Camail> i dunno if they even want to fix it

17:56:10 <Bio> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY9UCnaKgBs
17:57:01 <Zounds> Reeeeee
17:57:07 <Zounds> The only thing that bothered me was saurfang
17:57:18 <Zounds> was he still trying to commit suicide by alliance
17:57:24 <Bio> yes
17:57:39 <skram> saurfang is an old washed up has-been
17:57:41 <Bio> which is super dum
17:57:52 <Zounds> I thought he got over it during his cinematic
17:57:57 <Bio> lol no
17:58:00 <skram> did you see anduin
17:58:02 <Bio> apparently not
17:58:06 <skram> so pretty
17:58:12 <Bio> more like MANduin
17:58:22 <Bio> Pretty-Boy King
17:58:40 <Bio> xD
17:59:19 <Zounds> I'm glad we didn't kill saurfang but i feel its gonna bite us
17:59:43 <Zounds> But if he has to die better an actual fight than some 30vs1 shitstomp
18:00:07 <Zounds> even your enemies feeling bad for you isn't an honorable way to go
18:02:10 <Bio> its definitely a move away from the old horde.
18:02:34 <Bio> Loved the line from her about honor being worthless to a corpse
18:03:00 <Bio> and that the horde was worth saving, not sacrificing for outdated honor crap
18:03:40 <Zounds> outdated honor crap :/
18:03:48 <Zounds> nu-horde is just sad
18:03:59 <Bio> haha
18:04:22 <Bio> damn those nu-horde incels
18:04:25 <Bio> xD
18:04:48 <Bio> did you see both versions of the scenario
18:04:58 <Zounds> Nah i'll do the horde on in a bit
18:05:18 <Bio> it will explain the saurfang bit a little better imo
18:05:58 <Zounds> may aswell check it out
18:06:05 <Zounds> Surely my tauren hunter has no qualms gassing some guys
18:06:12 <Bio> as is tho, Anduin is gonna have to change a bit if he actually wants to win
18:06:24 <Zounds> you might be right about that
18:06:32 <Bio> he's gonna have to do some  M O R A L L Y  G R E Y stuff 
18:06:38 <Zounds> We've got all the dignity and stuff at the moment
18:06:42 <Bio> sylv is ruthless, and is playing to win
18:06:45 <Zounds> but not really winning much
18:07:07 <Zounds> Jaina will help him out with that I hope
18:07:13 <Bio> prolly
18:07:13 <Zounds> Let genn off his leash
18:07:27 <Bio> i LOVED the line about muzzling your dog
18:07:36 <Bio> she had some fuckin sizzlers in that last scene
18:08:05 <Zounds> Yeah she was quite good in that one
18:08:31 <Zounds> redeems her a bit from the cringe of the last animated cinematic thingy at teldrassi

18:58:20 <skram> they need a swift kick in the nads

18:59:23 <Bio> jaina got MAD daddy issues tho

19:00:01 <Bio> plus she's with a dragon and i just cant compete with that shit
19:00:16 <skram> dragons suck
19:00:21 <skram> we've killed like 30 of them
19:00:40 <Bio> eh
19:00:47 <Bio> not the big ones yet =P
19:01:11 <Dot> we threw 1 javlin and it ran off

19:03:43 <Bio> well he can go pout knowing that his warchief denied a strategic stronghold to their opponents instead of being honorable
19:03:58 <Bio> my undead ass loses no sleep
19:04:18 <Zounds> Yah, don't wanna lose battles you never needed to fight in the first place
19:04:24 <Zounds> >.>
19:04:40 <Bio> p much
19:05:05 <Cane> Eeeee, we have another thunderstorm. <3
19:05:08 <Zounds> Short sighted bio
19:05:15 <Zounds> just like your lady
19:05:51 <Bio> nah dude, there was a bit in the novel where she convinces saurfang to march on teldrasil by asking him how long peace will last
19:06:40 <Bio> there's people on the alliance that will never have peace with the forsaken just cause they exist
19:07:09 <Bio> cane you got our storms from yesterday
19:07:13 <Bio> noice
19:07:44 <Cane> They're mine now. I'll keep them in my basement and let them out for special occasions.
19:07:52 <Zounds> lol those alliance warmongers
19:08:05 <Bio> i agree
19:08:13 <Zounds> https://i.imgur.com/Yt0W4Ro.png
19:08:30 <Zounds> Sure do wonder why people hate the forsaken
19:08:44 <Zounds> It's a mystery
19:08:54 <Bio> thats a good maymay
19:09:10 <Bio> i'm sure theres one for the alliance somewhere
19:09:44 <Zounds> If you find it I'll be happy to look

19:11:51 <Zounds> fwiw I have no issue with the forsaken doing evil / "morally grey" stuff
19:11:58 <Bio> me either
19:12:25 <Zounds> It's the rest of the horde letting themselves be led around that just bugs me
19:12:54 <Zounds> What did sylvanas even say to saurfang
19:12:56 <Bio> its partly because its trying to operate in a 2 faction game
19:13:10 <Zounds> "There can't be peace because we're inevitably going to attack somebody so may aswell do it now?"
19:13:35 <Cane> I'm gonna go crash and just listen to the thunder. <3 Window closed but curtains open. Maybe I'll make some cocoa.
19:13:46 <Cane> Later. =)
19:13:49 <Zounds> o/
19:13:51 <Bio> she wanted to alpha strike, and remove the hope that the alliance could win a war or something to that effect
19:13:52 <Bio> peace
19:14:29 <Bio> i can't find it

19:14:48 <Bio> its part of the problem of having pretty important lore bits in short stories and books instead of in game
19:15:00 <Zounds> Yeah they have been making that mistake for years now
19:15:05 <Zounds> Well, "mistake"
19:15:12 <Zounds> people give them money either way
19:17:32 <Zounds> I wouldn't mind a bit of internal faction drama for the Alliance too at this point though
19:17:42 <Zounds> Seems unfair to give horde TMZ all the fun
19:17:53 <Zounds> First Garrosh now another dud warcheif
19:18:35 <Bio> https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/story/short-story/a-good-war
19:18:41 <Bio> heres that thing
19:18:44 <Zounds> Best boy vol'jin did not get his due
19:19:18 <skram> fuckin truth
19:19:30 <skram> and still he fucked it up at the end
19:19:36 <skram> make baine warchief
19:19:57 <skram> go home and smoke some leaves or whatever and be like chill all y'all
19:20:44 <Bio> Sylvanas’s eyes did not waver, even in the face of his rage. “If I dedicated myself to peace with the Alliance, would it last a year?”
19:20:45 <Bio> “Yes,” Saurfang said curtly.
19:20:45 <Bio> “How about two years? Five? Ten? Fifty?”
19:20:45 <Bio> Saurfang felt the trap closing in on him, and he did not like it. “We fought side‐by‐side against the Burning Legion. That creates bonds that are not easily broken.”
19:20:45 <Bio> “Time breaks every bond.” Sylvanas leaned across the table. Her words flew like arrows. “What do you believe? Will peace last five years or fifty?”
19:20:49 <skram> but nooooo, lets get the crazy lady to give everyone zombie aids instead
19:22:05 <Zounds> Yah sylvanas time breaks bonds
19:22:12 <Zounds> especially if you go out of your way to do it as fast as possible
19:22:15 -!- tredc [~tredc@c83-251-163-99.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
19:22:27 <Bio> before that, she's asking him how he would take over stormwind
19:22:42 <Bio> saurfang gets angry because he can't think of a way to do it
19:22:56 <Bio> she tells him to not think of it as the first objective, but the last
19:23:03 <skram> are they trying to set sylvanas up as another garrosh
19:23:11 <Bio> then she asks if org would withstand the alliance
19:23:17 <Bio> and he thinks, hell no
19:24:31 <Bio> there was a thread that said she might actually love the horde, but is super fuckin amoral about protecting it.
19:24:31 <Zounds> Well that's fair since it was so recently overrun by the alliance
19:24:33 <Bio> made sense
19:24:44 <Zounds> though with horde help ofc
19:25:15 <Bio> i think canonnically the invasion was like 90% allianced
19:26:26 <Bio> ok holy shit
19:26:32 <Bio> this fuckin story needed to be in the game
19:26:41 <Bio> like at all
19:27:10 <Zounds> Anything to make the horde appear less clownshoes to anybody who isn't a sylvanas lickspittle
19:27:40 <Bio> “You believe we can secure Kalimdor,” he said. “The entire continent.” It wasn’t a question. The Alliance’s main strength was in the Eastern Kingdoms. The Horde’s was in Kalimdor.
19:27:49 <Bio> -Saurfang
19:28:51 <Bio> the plan was to capture teldrasil to hostage it over a retaliatory attack against undercity
19:29:31 <Bio> but somewhere along the line, she realized that it would happen anyway, and it would be way to costly to keep the world tree and sacked it
19:29:52 <Zounds> Hm
19:29:53 <Bio> all the while, they finally take control of the forests of ashenvale
19:30:01 <Zounds> That somewhere really looks like when she gets sassed by the wounded Nelf
19:30:12 <skram> haha!
19:30:20 <Bio> and rebuild their navies that were wrecked by the legion
19:30:44 <skram> the fuck you need a navy for when the alliance has the flying fuckin dutchman
19:30:47 <Bio> once both factions had navies again, it would be too hard to attack teldrasil without getting destroyed
19:30:58 <Bio> well skrm, this was pre-dutchman
19:32:04 <Bio> she was banking on the alliance all trying to take advantage of the boy king by pulling his attention to their specific nations

19:32:38 <skram> are you making this all up bio
19:32:44 <Zounds> The Alliance is appearing rather united at this time
19:32:57 <Bio> but yes, sassy night elf made her realize that hope is harder to kill than just taking hostages
19:33:06 <Bio> kinda skram
19:33:25 <Bio> reading through that story that i linked and drawing conclusions and shit
19:33:27 <skram> i mean it is a bit idiotic
19:33:39 <skram> elf people have been through some proper shit
19:33:52 <skram> and its not the first time someone fucked with their trees
19:33:52 <Zounds> tbh I could see her point if the horde was behind her
19:34:09 <Zounds> Surely she knows that she is just fucking up her own faction way more than what she is doing the alliance
19:34:10 <Zounds> SURELY
19:34:18 <Bio> “And that is how you defeat Stormwind.” Saurfang was in awe. It was brilliant. Destroying the Alliance wouldn’t take a thousand victories. It would take one. With a single strategic push, the pressure on the Alliance would cripple them for years, just as long as they could not conjure any miracles on the battlefield. “You destroy the Alliance from within. Their military might counts for nothing if their member
19:34:18 <Bio> s stand alone. Then we strike peace with the individual nations and carve them away from the Alliance, piece by piece.”
19:34:23 <skram> its lazy and kinda stupid and all it does is set her up as a major villain
19:34:34 <Bio> I don't see it as lazy
19:34:47 <skram> my boi anduin the wrynn is practically jesus and you have this other lady tryna kill people with what is basically the plague
19:34:51 <skram> that also turns you into a zombie
19:34:59 <Zounds> I don't think it's lazy either
19:35:01 <Zounds> But it is stupid
19:35:03 <Runbunny> literally Thrall 2.0
19:35:29 <skram> thrall was all honor this and honor that and then he fucked off doing shaman shit or whatever he's up to now
19:35:39 <Zounds> Even doing the Horde scenario there
19:35:40 <Bio> oh man
19:35:42 <Zounds> THe dialogue and stuff
19:35:47 <Bio> this fuckin line sucks
19:35:49 <Zounds> It really seems like the Alliance are just plain good guy heroes
19:35:54 <Bio> second
19:36:05 <Zounds> And the horde are just festering shitpiles
19:36:09 <Zounds> being cucked by their leader
19:36:27 <skram> p much
19:37:43 <skram> is this gonna be another old god kinda thing
19:38:06 <Zounds> Oh I'm a tauren hunter from mulgore, gained glory amongst my people with my hunting prowess
19:38:14 <Zounds> fought many battles against the evils of the world
19:38:45 <Zounds> battled the lich king, Illidan, deathwing and many more
19:38:54 <Zounds> Time to start spraying people with blight boys
19:38:58 <skram> I think the Earthmother would be miffed by you POISONING THE FUCKIN EARTH
19:39:29 <skram> they did do the zombie aids once before and that wasnt recieved very well
19:39:29 <Zounds> Though to be fair it's not the first time I've sprayed people with blight as a tauren
19:39:37 <Zounds> It just kinda happens in forsaken quest hubs sometimes
19:39:41 <Zounds> and we're all okay with it for some reason
19:40:29 <skram> wonder what alexstrasza thinks about this
