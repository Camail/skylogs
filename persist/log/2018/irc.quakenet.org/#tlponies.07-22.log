00:49:08 <Crisium> nothing crazy
00:49:16 <Crisium> but close game so far
01:16:20 <Crisium> NYXL eliminated
01:16:24 <Micen|Droid_> Cool stuff happened
01:32:38 <Camail> i feel like terraria with mods would be fun
01:49:25 <Bio> mayhaps
02:39:36 <DvB`> Terrarraer is gud
02:40:36 <DvB`> Big mods like Calamity have nice filled-out wikis now, and add enough that you don't always feel like there is only one "next step" 
03:11:34 <Camail> i wish my vps was beefy enough for a server
03:49:02 <Bio> I swear i get better seeds when I don't stream
03:49:19 <Bio> but i could have saved like 20 mins if i learned to do lampless

19:15:17 <Runbunny> Jonas, kammerat.
19:20:35 <skram> How are you doing
19:23:25 <Dot> skram, runbun
19:23:47 <skram> Ah Dot my good friend
19:24:19 <Runbunny> I'm tired and I think I might run out of reagent during the next week.
19:24:28 <Runbunny> Which is not good.
19:24:39 <skram> How do you get your eye of newt and unicorn tears
19:25:00 <Runbunny> That's the thing, I order it and it's expensive.
19:25:15 <Runbunny> Plus I spent a whole lot of money already.
19:25:55 <Dot> stop buying loli stuff runbun
19:26:03 <Dot> skram, where did you go?
19:26:49 <Runbunny> Dot I need it.
19:26:57 <Runbunny> How else am I gonna?
19:27:24 <Zounds> Crisium you wanna qp today? :3
19:34:03 <Phearlock> Finally got around to finishing the main quest of The Witcher 3.
19:34:15 <Phearlock> 104 hours, good game.
19:39:27 <Cane> Phearlock, yeah I finished that about a month or so ago.
19:39:33 <Cane> Really good game. Lot of content.
19:41:38 <Phearlock> I'll get started on finishing up the DLC
19:42:02 <Golly> problem with witcher 3 in now i compare others to it

19:44:05 <Phearlock> Mhmm
19:44:25 <skram> i had to do the sunday coffee visit parents and siblings thing Dot
19:44:30 <Bio> I can't get into open world games like that for very long
19:44:38 <Bio> they just aren't my style I guess
19:46:10 <Camail> this first witcher dlc is kinda meh other than one mission that was really fun, it almost feels like the entire thing was created just for this one gimmick
19:46:18 <Camail> i never played the second but i heard it was amazing
19:46:56 <Cane> Yeah the first DLC is just okay.
19:47:21 <Cane> But you can tell a lot of love went into the second one.
19:47:45 <Cane> The new land is gorgeous.
19:50:05 <Camail> i think i ruined wither 3 for myself, i got 75% through ng+ and something clicked off, permanently burned out on that game
19:50:16 <Camail> it's been years and i still dont want to play the second dlc
19:51:33 <Camail> ciri has such a godlike character design tho
19:54:36 <Cane> She does.
19:57:24 <Runbunny> Cane, Is this you? https://i.redd.it/h5rbqpia2fb11.jpg
19:57:29 <Runbunny> Did you make this?
19:58:16 <Cane> LOL no but I saw it and felt right at home.
19:58:47 <Cane> So cozy. <3
19:59:01 <Cane> I did spend most of the thunderstorm just standing by the window and watching the rain and lightning though, so. =)
19:59:33 <Runbunny> Yeah, I saw it and instantly thought of you, when I was working earlier.
19:59:49 <Runbunny> Also Dot skram https://i.imgur.com/6pFkjEi.jpg
20:08:52 <skram> I think I liked the first DLC more than pretend france actually
20:09:22 <skram> Though Blood & Wine was gorgeous
20:14:52 <Phearlock> Well I'm not nearly burned out yet so I'll get through both those DLC's
20:14:56 <Phearlock> Not today though =P

22:04:29 <Camail> its obscene
22:13:01 <Cane> lol whaz.
22:13:36 <DuB`> It's always close for the first dozen kills and then they run away with it
22:13:43 <Cane> Yeah.
22:13:43 <DuB`> 2 good
22:13:50 <Camail> visor is so damn good
22:14:00 <Cane> rapha on Visor is amazing.
22:14:04 <Cane> He's so good at communicating everything.
22:14:10 <Camail> the map starts split,  with each side typically getting one item
22:14:27 <Camail> so they are on an even playing field for the first few minutes
22:14:56 <Camail> but as they work the map they start delaying one of the items so that they can go in a loop, taking the map when they want
22:15:36 <Camail> if you have both items spawn at the same time then its harder to get stacked, and its crazy how they manage to manipulate it
22:17:35 <Camail> lul, waiting out quad to rj up to rail
22:17:43 <Camail> i've killed myself like that...
