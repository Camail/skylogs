12:00:35 <Cane> I love the deep rumble of a receding storm.
12:01:15 <Cane> Couple of years ago the lightning struck a tree just across the road 40 yards away.
12:01:18 <Cane> That was slightly loud.
12:01:19 <Dot`> sent you link on discord skram, will see of it works

12:01:58 <Runbunny> Is it drifting south?
12:02:00 <Cane> Runbunny, did, it's passing atm.
12:02:12 <Cane> More like east.
12:02:27 <Cane> I still hear the rumblings of distant thunder. <3
12:02:39 <Runbunny> We could use a storm south :/
12:03:22 <Cane> It's 21* and 60% humidity. My head feels foggy. =)
12:03:27 <Cane> Worth it for the storm though.
