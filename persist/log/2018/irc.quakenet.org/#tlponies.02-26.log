03:49:30 <DuB`> ZZZ
04:05:46 <Camail> woo, subnautica was fun
04:06:03 <Camail> one of the best interest curves I've ever experienced in a game
04:06:16 <DuB`> Looks nice
04:06:19 <DuB`> I like ocean
04:06:25 <Phearlock> I'm sitting right at the endgame in my save
04:06:47 <Camail> oh boy phear, that stuff is fun
04:08:23 <Camail> just a really good game,  a smooth silky experience
04:08:52 <Camail> only got lost one time and had to look up one thing, but everything else had redundant systems to let your exploration be rewarded
04:09:03 <Phearlock> I am considering just looking up a final couple of hidden things
04:09:18 <Phearlock> Because I feel like I've been everywhere and probably just missed them
04:09:30 <Phearlock> But everything else has been great
04:09:31 <Camail> I'm not concerned with finding all the hidden area, i think its just loot
04:09:42 <Camail> i never found the orange key
04:09:50 <Phearlock> Oh, got that
04:09:59 <Camail> but this game becomes awful if you're hunting for a single thing in a 2km^2 circle
04:10:09 <Phearlock> Yuup xD
04:10:26 <Phearlock> I think you have some idea of what I'm looking for considering it's story required
04:10:36 <Camail> yea i looked that up
04:11:02 <Phearlock> I loved the whole like expedition feeling you got when deciding to go look somewhere new.
04:11:28 <Camail> yea, i distinctly remember "i haven't gone south yet, let's go"
04:11:36 <Phearlock> Stock up the vehicle and go take a dive
04:11:47 <Camail> and each zone is like a piece of pie so every direction is new content
04:12:06 <Camail> other than one huge area
04:12:29 <Camail> there's like a giant dessert with nothing but a leviathan so fuck dat
04:12:44 <Phearlock> ..I fell off the map once
04:12:47 <Camail> i yelped every time he kissed me
04:13:03 <Camail> i dove off the map and had two big ol dickfaces chasing me
04:13:09 <Phearlock> Yup
04:13:27 <Camail> but yea i got to that end area with like, no food or water
04:13:35 <Phearlock> oh dear
04:13:40 <Camail> i kinda just forgot about it, i was so concerned with a few other things
04:14:15 <Camail> it got really complicated, and i ended up leaving my seamoth down there
04:14:34 <Camail> plus side is that you can swim really far with the big air tank
04:14:53 <Phearlock> My cyclops is currently sitting at 1400 meters for reasons.
04:14:59 <Phearlock> And I'm way up at the surface
04:15:03 <Camail> no power?
04:15:07 <Phearlock> Oh plenty
04:15:13 <Camail> oh, i had leech problems
04:15:24 <Phearlock> I had that the first time.
04:15:48 <Phearlock> I figured out you could just pull the cells out of the engine and put them in a storage locker for when you left it to go exploring
04:15:52 <Phearlock> And the leeches just ignored it
04:16:21 <Camail> yea i did that, but i left the lights on during my prawn expedition
04:16:37 <Camail> i came back with 14%, oh also i never found the power cell recharger
04:16:48 <Camail> i DID but i thought it was extra copies of the battery charger and never scanned them
04:16:56 <Camail> so i just had to keep replacing them
04:17:13 <Phearlock> That thing was handy, hooked it up to a nuclear plant at my 800meter base =P
04:17:27 <Camail> yea i had a base near the entrance to end game
04:17:39 <Camail> did you use the giant hole in the ground that led directly to it?
04:17:57 <Phearlock> My base was sorta on the other side so I didn't use that, I went past the tree.
04:18:06 <Phearlock> I did find that hole though
04:18:21 <Camail> yea i got to the tree and then didnt see the drop behind it so i ended up finding it through that other hole
04:19:12 <Phearlock> I was a little bummed torpedoes were bluh. But that's ok cause the prawn suit + handheld stasis rifle was everything I ever needed.
04:19:35 <Camail> i used drill + grapple
04:19:41 <Phearlock> Give everything a few good love taps to encourage them to go eat something else
04:20:09 <Phearlock> I carried the drill + grapple with me and swapped them around a bunch.
04:20:13 <Camail> yea torpedoes are probably leviathan deterrent?
04:20:15 <Phearlock> I did like the grabby arms
04:20:35 <Camail> piloting the cyclops was really fun
04:20:42 <Phearlock> Eh there's a gas cloud torpedo that does about as much damage as a grabby claw bap
04:20:59 <Camail> they take up too much room
04:21:02 <Phearlock> and a stasis one which while it has a stronger effect than the stasis rifle..
04:21:17 <Phearlock> couldn't really compete
04:21:20 <Camail> i never had issues with animals in the prawn suit
04:21:32 <Phearlock> Nah me neither
04:21:40 <Camail> if they got too close i pretended they were ore deposits and mined their flesh
04:22:07 <Phearlock> Grappling my way across the lava fields was good fun
04:22:11 <Camail> also THOSE aliens were never a problem if you always had your propeller equipped
04:22:17 <Phearlock> Yeah
04:22:27 <Phearlock> Stasis, bap with knife
04:22:39 <Camail> they cant look up
04:22:43 <Camail> so i would swim over their heads
04:22:47 <Camail> and back stab them a bunch
04:22:49 <Phearlock> lol
04:23:39 <Camail> but yea, you should look up where that thing is, and scan it
04:23:45 <Phearlock> And yeah using the sonar function was so fun.
04:23:47 <Camail> i didnt know about scanning them
04:23:59 <Phearlock> I wish it used less power so I could just always have it on
04:24:02 <Phearlock> It was cool
04:24:08 <Camail> i never built the sonar function for the cyclops
04:24:26 <Phearlock> Bloody only way to see where I was going sometimes
04:24:31 <Phearlock> Visibility downwards was not the best
04:24:52 <Camail> the cameras were more than enough for me
04:25:08 <Camail> and you never took damage from collision
04:25:17 <Phearlock> True
04:25:34 <Camail> i fit my cyclops through a pretty tiny hole by tilting it mostly vertically
04:25:35 <Phearlock> Would have been fine without. But I really enjoyed the terrain overlay
04:25:41 <Camail> just kinda, rammed it in there
04:26:02 <Camail> yea i was happy with my upgrades so never bothered colelcting the stuff
04:26:12 <Phearlock> Got a sense of scale in some dark areas that I otherwise wouldn't have.
04:26:22 <Camail> at around your point i was desperately looking for a solution because the game was yelling at me
04:26:33 <Camail> "hey maybe do something about this thing, NOW"
04:26:47 <Camail> the self scans were genius
04:27:00 <Camail> made me paranoid
04:27:10 <Phearlock> Haha I got to that point when I still hadn't gotten a prawn suit or cyclops (found a random mk3 module for my seamoth fairly early on)
04:27:25 <Phearlock> So I was like "umm, I don't see a time limit, I'm going to assume there isn't a time limit"
04:27:51 <Phearlock> "Because I certainly can't get to the next bit"
04:28:02 <Phearlock> Good fun
04:28:38 <Camail> oh great, steam is russian again
04:28:45 <Camail> this is weird
04:29:17 <Camail> oh, its cuz i clicked a steam link with the russian text....
04:29:20 <Camail> i hate that feature
04:29:27 <Phearlock> facinating
04:29:50 <Phearlock> I'm gonna head off to bed. But yeah. Subnautica. Good game.
04:29:54 <Phearlock> Sea ponies should try it
04:30:27 <Camail> cya
04:30:34 <Bio> *underwater neighing*
04:30:53 <Camail> unless you are really scared of underwater monsters
04:30:55 <Camail> then dont
04:31:30 <Camail> but honestly, almost everything loses the fear once you get passed the mystique
04:31:59 <Camail> but that's the whole point
04:32:11 <Camail> at first going farther than 100m is awful
04:32:27 <Camail> and you get to an area where you aren't able to even see the bottom even with all the tools you have
04:32:38 <Camail> and you use shitty straws to breath
04:32:55 <Camail> then you gain tech, gain depth, visit new areas, progress, its all very fluid
04:33:07 <Bio> heh
04:33:08 <Bio> fluid
04:33:17 <Camail> boo
04:33:20 <Camail> 2 years dungeon
04:33:28 <Bio> =(
04:34:59 <Bio> I'm glad that the company did a good game, I liked NS2 and wish more people played it. Glad they had a hit
04:35:48 <Camail> oh god, this game in vr would not be fun
04:36:03 <Camail> too much empty space, i would die just looking at the darkness
04:36:52 <Phearlock> I put the kitten poster next to the cyclops damage display screen.
04:37:10 <Phearlock|bed> It was fitting
04:39:14 <Camail> hehe

21:47:07 <Dot`> mine is about 7 years old, almost 8
21:47:17 <Dot`> i have been thinking of looking at mice
21:47:22 <DuB`> Logitech g403 looks nice
21:47:40 <DuB`> I need to test with new not-trashed mousepad too and make sure that's not part of the problem
21:47:45 <Zounds> I use a mionix castor

21:51:40 <Dot`> dub, Logitech g403  looks nice and simple
21:51:50 <DuB`> Might be a bit tall for me
21:51:56 <DuB`> I like little mice for my little hands
21:51:58 <Dot`> the wired is also not stupidly expensive
21:52:08 <DuB`> Can't stand my brother's deathadder for example

21:53:11 <Rawr|Fone> I am very old now
21:53:17 <Dot`> he is 14 now
22:21:56 <Camail> dub what mouse pad did you get
22:22:25 <Camail> i just cleaned my qck+, that thing was so dirty the sensor was having issues
22:22:37 <DuB`> Same one
22:22:58 <DuB`> Just tried with my brother's pristine one and had the same mouse weirdness though
22:22:59 <Camail> luckily i have a qck, because i got one for someone as a gift and they fucked up and sent me 5
22:23:26 <DuB`> Should clean it anyway though, how did you go about it?
22:23:53 <Camail> dish soap and a lot of rubbing
22:24:15 <Crisium> hmm i should get a new pad
22:24:17 <Camail> it handles water find so just submerge it in an inch of water and keep going
22:24:18 <Crisium> mines dirty
22:24:26 <DuB`> Gotcha
22:24:36 <Camail> fine*
22:24:47 <DuB`> Hmmm
22:25:01 <DuB`> Wonder if any local places, best buy etc, would have a g403
22:25:15 <DuB`> So hard to judge size/fit from pics...
22:25:24 <Camail> get it form amazon then refund if you dont like it
22:25:31 <DuB`> ye
22:25:33 <Crisium> i have a zowie fk2 mouse, cause its super light
22:25:35 <Camail> i did that with the the final mouse fk1
22:27:01 <Crisium> i have this pad Camail, same type of material as yours you think? https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826995023

22:27:27 <Camail> the + is just fucking huge
22:27:39 <DuB`> I have +
22:27:47 <Camail> like 18" or something
22:27:49 <Crisium> yeah mini is fine for me, i play on high sense and use 1600fpi in windows
22:27:56 <Camail> i dont have the desk space or the need
22:29:00 <Camail> mini is good for most cases, other than csgo
22:29:15 <Camail> my next keyboard i'm tempted to get a small one without the key pad
22:29:20 <Camail> takes up so much space
22:30:03 <Camail> wont need a new one for a looooong time tho
22:30:23 <DuB`> 10key is must have!
22:31:04 <Camail> oh right, you're a number nerd
22:31:33 <DuB`> :D
22:34:48 <Zounds> I used to be a very low sensitivity player
22:34:57 <Zounds> but I found it a bit limiting in overwatch
22:35:15 <Crisium> im a wrist only aimer so i have to play pretty high or my wrist will literally melt
22:35:22 <Zounds> I'm sorta low still though, 800 dpi / 3.5 in game
22:35:28 <Crisium> lmao thats low
22:35:39 <DuB`> Very :o
22:35:46 <Crisium> 2,800 eDPI is pretty much what the Pros play on
22:35:51 <Zounds> My entire desk is a mousemat
22:35:53 <Runbunny> Has your wrist melted before Crisium? O:
22:35:57 <DuB`> I'm 1600/2.5 and use my whole qck+
22:36:01 <Crisium> im 1600 / 5.25 = 8400 eDPI
22:36:23 <Crisium> yes run bunn
22:36:30 <Runbunny> Dang.
22:36:33 <Crisium> gets sore a lot because i have to use it at work
22:36:46 <Zounds> I'm quite comfortable with my current sense for Overwatch though
22:36:53 <Zounds> I can play Tracer and Genji no bother
22:37:03 <Crisium> generally as low as you can go and not have to strain yourself is ideal
22:37:13 <Crisium> i cant go any lower than 8,400 eDPI
22:37:30 <Crisium> id have to relearn aiming with the arm
22:37:42 <Crisium> my arm is motionless
22:37:54 <Crisium> used for very quick turning occasionally i guess
22:38:09 <Zounds> You seem to have pretty decent tracking regardless
22:38:27 <Crisium> ty pon
22:39:02 <Crisium> i used to play at 1600/15 until someone in TLP yelled at me to lower it (dub?)
22:39:16 <Crisium> then i did 1600/7.5 for a while before moving to 5.25
22:39:36 <Zounds> Feels like a impulse signal from your brain would send your character spinning at that sense
22:39:44 <Crisium> pretty much
22:40:23 <Camail> i've met a few people with insanely high sens like that, and have aggressively argued for it
22:40:33 <Camail> "it gives me the edge in flick time"
22:40:47 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:40:47 <Crisium> na, it's a hindrance
22:40:50 <Camail> bitch the .001 extra seconds does not help when you do over flick
22:41:03 <Crisium> even if you are wrist only you dont need to be higher than like 10,000 eDPI
22:41:35 <Crisium> for OW, i dont remember what the cm per 360 is or anything lol
22:41:40 <Camail> flicking is almost always a failure of the player's game sense
22:41:51 <Camail> ow is more vertical so there are more angles, but even then
22:41:55 <Zounds> That explains why I almost exclusively flick
22:41:59 <Zounds> No brain all aim baby
22:41:59 <Camail> like god damn, you should know where they are going to be
22:42:32 <Camail> flicking is inconsistent, either your hitting all your shots or none of them
22:42:45 <Zounds> I feel like flicking isn't always a reaction though
22:43:03 <Camail> that's why i hedged my statement with my earlier comments
22:43:19 <Camail> there's really only a few times where flicking is needed, its when you need to cover two angles at the same time
22:43:29 <Camail> you pre-aim the most common and prepare to flick the other one
22:43:45 <Camail> sometimes i hold an angle and practice flicking to the alternate angle before i even make contact
22:43:54 <Zounds> I can see that for CSGO sure
22:44:29 <Camail> eh, its like that in overwatch, just with the more vertical element like i said
22:44:51 <Zounds> Except you'll likely be in a team fight with multiple guys infront of you
22:45:06 <Zounds> Not dropping enemies as soon as they are in line of sight
22:45:44 <Zounds> Flicking is a style rather than a reaction at that point
22:45:49 <Zounds> Say i'm on McCree for example
22:46:12 <Zounds> I'll flick a lucio and between shots my gun will remain pointing at wherever I last flicked
22:46:34 <Zounds> It just works better for some people than attempting to follow the lucios movement
22:47:00 <Zounds> you pretty much just make a snapshot muscle memory decision based on the distance of your crosshair to the little bastard
22:47:10 <Camail> there might be some confusing of terminology here, i dont consider ALL mouse movement as flicking
22:47:55 <Camail> but having to do sudden mouse movements that are larger than like, 5cm on screen?
22:48:02 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:49:43 <Camail> i dont make the distinction between flicking and tracking, that's not the way its used in csgo, anyway
22:49:52 <Crisium> pro flicking in OW is weird to me.  they literally will flick to the target, shoot, then flick away and then flick back for the second shot...
22:50:12 <Crisium> its not flick then track... its flick then flick away and back again
22:50:13 <Camail> so i think some of that is because mcree, at least, has the crosshair move on its own
22:50:22 <Camail> it happens in csgo two where it looks like pros move away when they tap
22:50:22 <Crisium> mccree and widow pros yeah
22:50:33 <Camail> but they are not really moving, its the screen
22:50:40 <Camail> you never notice it while playing because you feel it
22:50:54 <Camail> and it makes sense to feel the recoil
22:51:41 <Zounds> It's not just pros that do that cris
22:51:48 <Zounds> I do the exact same thing
22:52:16 <Camail> or you are reseting your hand position in between each hit
22:52:31 <Camail> its easier to have muscle memory from one position and just re-use that
22:53:05 <Crisium> god i dont even know how i play mccree anymore.  i actively try NOT to think about aiming when i play him and just let nature take over
22:53:21 <Zounds> Yes camail
22:53:21 <Crisium> he used to be my best dps but its probably tracer or soldier now because my tracking is better
22:53:27 <Zounds> it wasn't a learned behaviour just a habit
22:53:54 <Camail> losing confidence in aim is basically a death sentence

22:54:49 <Crisium> tracking with zarya high charge beam is the most fun aiming to me
22:54:52 <Crisium> melt everyone
22:54:58 <Crisium> one at a time
22:55:00 <Camail> if overwatch put csgo man in i would jump back in
22:55:11 <Camail> there's just no one i want to click m1 with
22:55:16 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:55:50 <Crisium> its definitely far simpler in OW
22:56:53 <Crisium> if only torb moved faster with his hammer out, then cam would play
22:57:47 <Zounds> I don't like hitscan with recoil patterns
22:57:52 <Zounds> so CS was always bleh for me
22:58:04 <Crisium> yeah honestly it takes a lot of practice to memorize that
22:58:14 <Zounds> Gimmie a railgun or an NS2 rifle
22:58:28 <Zounds> Leave recoil to projectile games like planetside or BF and i'm happy
22:58:55 <Crisium> OW is so easy.  either it instantly blooms, is always accurate, or is accurate in bursts and then blooms.  and then it either has vertical crosshair movement or it doesnt
22:58:58 <Crisium> nothing else really
22:59:35 <Camail> in csgo its a bit complicated, you are mostly shooting 4-6 bullet bursts
22:59:54 <Camail> sometimes tapping, sometimes using 20-30 bullets, but that's rare and quite hard to do
23:00:14 <Crisium> pretty much every gun is different tho right
23:00:16 <Camail> also mouse movements are slower while shooting than moving, so spray transfer feels nuts
23:00:27 <Camail> well every gun is different but you only have use like 5 guns
23:00:41 <Camail> there are only 2 good rifles, one sniper, 1 smg
23:00:57 <Camail> the pistols you always tap with or are playing so close you spray and pray
23:01:12 <Crisium> ? ? ?_? ?? give negev ? ? ?_? ??
23:01:26 <Camail> negev doesnt actually have recoil
23:01:29 <Camail> it has negative recoil
23:01:40 <Camail> it starts being a cone of shit  then turns into a laser
23:01:51 <Camail> it is the meme gun if you're up 10-0
23:02:05 <Crisium> is P90 still sometimes valid?
23:02:10 <Camail> never
23:02:13 <Crisium> aw
23:02:22 <Camail> it never really was
23:02:28 <Zounds> It's a good thing OW is easy to aim in mechanically
23:02:31 <Camail> there are cheaper guns that do the same thing, sometimes even better
23:02:47 <Zounds> can you imagine trying to hit an AdAding tracer who has no inertia
23:02:52 <Camail> the CZ is an automatic pistol that invalidates most SMGs
23:02:54 <Zounds> if you had to deal with non laser accurate guns
23:03:15 <Camail> well in ow movement is much more complicated for the opponent, so they had to do that
23:03:17 <Crisium> imagine is OW had actual movement inertia
23:03:22 <Crisium> if*
23:03:26 <Zounds> hitscan would just clean up
23:03:29 <Crisium> AD spam wouldnt be as useful
23:03:31 <Zounds> I'd be into it :P
23:03:41 <Camail> there's no counter strafing or movement penalties, really, but you have so much more acceleration
23:03:51 <Crisium> theres 0 acceleration in OW lol
23:04:02 <Camail> well, infinite
23:04:09 <Camail> 0 would mean you all sit in spawn
23:04:10 <Crisium> right
23:04:18 <Camail> which would be a bold move
23:04:40 <Crisium> instantly can go from moving left 5.5 m/s to moving right 5.5 m/s
23:04:46 <Crisium> ADADADAD
23:04:49 <Camail> yea the game gets rough when someone with good aim can just peak out for a nanosecond and shoot people
23:05:39 <Camail> csgo doesnt have to deal with team comps as much
23:05:46 <Crisium> terrorist OP
23:05:48 <Crisium> nerf pls
23:05:49 <Camail> it still does, but you cant outright lose because of any one decision
23:05:53 <Camail> you say that
23:06:02 <Camail> but they get the only rifle that can 1 tap kill
23:06:05 <Camail> cheaper molotovs
23:06:12 <Camail> they get to 5v2 your site
23:06:27 <Crisium> thats why i said that lol, i always thought they were OP when i played
23:06:29 <Camail> they get a ton of advantages because being offensive is hard
23:06:57 <Camail> the hard part is that Ts need to be more organized and are forced to take map control
23:07:26 <Camail> also CTs using the auto-pistol are scary
23:07:47 <Crisium> return to OW camail, you dont even have to aim
23:07:51 <Crisium> Winston is meta
23:08:01 <Zounds> I think he would hate it
23:08:04 <Crisium> ;p;
23:08:04 <Camail> i dunno, ow hurts my hand
23:08:10 <Zounds> After playing CSGO
23:08:13 <Camail> being able to pre aim and hold an angle in csgo is the only reason  can play
23:08:19 <Zounds> Some tard Junkrat accidently kills you
23:08:22 <Zounds> I don't think I could take it
23:08:33 <Camail> the hand thing and also the me not liking ow a whole lot
23:08:43 <Camail> i played for a long time tho
23:09:06 <Camail> Zounds nah that's nothing, you have a chance to kill him
23:09:18 <Camail> imagine playing against a guy that just erases you with a single hit
23:09:25 <Camail> just, you didnt even play the game
23:09:46 <Camail> doesnt matter what decisions you made
23:09:59 <Zounds> I can respect being deleted at least
23:10:01 <Crisium> Widow? Doomfist?
23:10:03 <Zounds> Less so dumb luck
23:10:27 <Zounds> Yeah even within OW I'm way less salty about being shot by widow than doomfist stunlocking me
23:10:39 <Crisium> cause doomfist has 3 stun moves
23:10:46 <Crisium> created to annoy
23:10:55 <Crisium> id rather be hooked 100 times
23:11:09 <Camail> roadhog is like 30% of the reason i quit
23:11:29 <Camail> i kinda hate everything about his design visually and mechanically
23:11:52 <Zounds> I like him because he's a juicy target to headshot
23:11:53 <Crisium> they made him more of a tank
23:12:21 <Crisium> but yeah, hook into kill is still a thing on much of the cast
23:12:36 <Crisium> but at least not as much
23:13:23 <Zounds> Takes a tad more effort on the hogs part even on the easy guys to 1 shot

23:14:02 <Camail> but like... i have no interest in being or hitting him
23:14:06 <Camail> just a cold, blank stare
23:14:34 <Crisium> its d.va + winston now for the most part
23:14:50 <Zounds> yeah d.va is the tank that will delete you nowadays
23:14:51 <Crisium> which is thrilling to play, and terrifying to fight against
23:15:13 <Crisium> d.va is so fun now, but she is probably borked
23:15:53 <Crisium> can shoot while flying, and gets a new missile attack that does crazy burst daamage.  if you can kill a hero in less than a secodn you messed up
23:16:09 <Crisium> if you cant* kill a hero that quickly, you messed up
23:19:33 <Zounds> yeah she's real strong
23:19:41 <Zounds> I still prefer to be the monkey in a dive comp though
