00:00:03 <DuB`> Do you need a zarya main, skram?
00:00:17 <Crisium> i wish i could help boost you with OP mercy
00:00:21 <Crisium> but they nerfed her
00:00:34 <Crisium> no one is that OP now to be ablet to carry
00:03:07 <Crisium> DuB` when you do your placements
00:03:59 <DuB`> I was gonna say this weekend but I'm going back to parents' on friday, so dunno
00:04:11 <DuB`> Might be back with time on Sat still
00:05:17 <Crisium> Zayra only? or you flex to other off tank

00:05:40 <DuB`> I've played everything in comp lol
00:06:45 <Crisium> attack torb confirmed
00:08:06 <DuB`> Say No To Torb
00:10:01 <Crisium> but that turret my dude
00:11:30 <Crisium> controls space, takes enemy attention, meanwhile you yourself can alternate between tank buster and long range shield disruption while supporting teammates with extra survivability armor packs
00:11:33 <DuB`> It steals all the fun!
00:11:38 <Crisium> hmm, adding flex torb to my resume
00:11:43 <Crisium> sounds good
00:11:53 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
00:16:01 <Micen|Slep> but Torb is fun
00:16:21 <Micen|Slep> you summoned me with the mention of torb
00:17:19 <reification> ah we should stack again to bring the reign of sym torb terror
00:17:30 <reification> 300hp tracer is lol
00:18:24 <Crisium> yes
00:18:29 <Crisium> sym + torb is so good as a cheese
00:18:39 <Crisium> so long as you have tanks and support that can do damage
00:19:53 <reification> i couldn’t make it to diamond before the mercy nerfs :(
00:20:09 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
00:20:39 <Crisium> now you just gotta play someone that is better b/c of fewer rezzes
00:20:47 <Crisium> widow, hanzo, roadhog, doomfist
00:20:52 <Crisium> anyone who can get a 1-2 shot kill basically
00:21:00 <Crisium> picks are better now
00:21:10 <Crisium> tracer too should be better
00:21:26 <skram> I dont even know anymore
00:21:50 <skram> I had 2000 hp/m in healing as moira and we still got fucked
00:21:53 <Crisium> or become Zen one trick like I am
00:22:04 <Crisium> im like 80% zen
00:22:48 <Crisium> Moira is hard to carry, her burst healing is the best in the game, but healing cant make your teammates get picks
00:22:57 <reification> such is support life skram
00:23:00 <Crisium> her damage is good, but low burst.  max 100fps per target
00:23:12 <Crisium> this is why Zen is ultimate carry, he can delete targets in 1 second or less
00:23:35 <Crisium> support main who feels they are in a rank lower than they should = play zen
00:23:40 <skram> I just need my friends to stand in front of my beam
00:23:52 <Crisium> just need to frag as zen
00:24:26 <skram> zen is fucking impossible against a decent tracer/genji
00:24:34 <skram> because you wont obviously get any help ever
00:25:00 <Crisium> tracer isnt a problem in plat-diamond unless they are a smurf tbh
00:25:05 <Crisium> genji is, just gotta pray there
00:25:10 <Crisium> but it worked for me
00:25:46 <reification> but keeping zen alive is like job #1 for me as mercy…
00:27:12 <reification> after all who am i going to fly away to if we have no pharah?
00:27:15 <Crisium> skram, suggest you go Zen+Moira only
00:27:23 <Crisium> but more zen
00:27:23 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
00:27:40 <Crisium> go moira only if your team cant help but feed ults to the enemy team (take damage for no reason)
00:27:59 <Crisium> then you can get infinite moira ults
00:28:45 <skram> eh if you have to spend all your juice healing idiots before a push starts you're pretty limited
00:28:54 <reification> i love to press Q at every opportunity so moira is perfect
00:29:11 <Crisium> she gets it every minute so yeah
00:29:43 <Crisium> there was an OWL game where a moira got ult in 29 seconds of the round starting
00:29:49 <reification> abusing the heal over time and sneaking in damage to recharge meter is the art
00:30:05 <Crisium> yes
00:30:35 <reification> we did the 4tank/moira/lucio thing in scrim and it worked great
00:30:40 <Crisium> nice
00:30:47 <Crisium> id like to try it one day
00:33:10 <Crisium> this OWL game
00:33:11 <Crisium> good one
00:33:28 <reification> such a fast zen ult again :O
00:33:31 <skram> i dont like how they keep saying "the fusion"

00:44:17 <skram> shadowburn only konws how to play 2 heroes
00:46:13 <Crisium> genji and pharah?
00:46:19 <skram> yeah
00:47:03 <reification> i would settlle for being able to play 1 hero as well as shadowburn :p
00:50:34 <skram> Is the mercy nerf live in OWL?
00:51:10 <Crisium> no, not until stage 2
00:51:11 <Crisium> feb 21
00:51:18 <skram> ait
00:51:20 <skram> makes sense
00:51:24 <reification> owl doesn’t change mid stage
00:51:29 <DuB`> Pretty lame
00:52:00 <Crisium> 4 weeks of lame duck mercy
00:53:02 <skram> Well thats how it works in most games DuB`

00:53:16 <skram> They're not gonna do big balance changes in the middle of The International or whatever
00:54:05 <DuB`> OWL stages are like 2 months long though :(
00:55:24 <DuB`> Hmm
00:55:31 <DuB`> I should stoody but now I'm watching OWL
00:55:37 <DuB`> And it goes aaalll night
00:55:39 <skram> fuk stoody
00:55:45 <DuB`> Might as well give up and play :P
00:56:49 <skram> miss timed winston bubble
00:56:51 <skram> poor boy
00:57:00 <DuB`> Nearly
00:57:01 <Micen|Slep> i guess i should watch OW
00:57:08 <Crisium> good game micen
00:57:17 <Crisium> probably best of the night
00:57:18 <DuB`> I like both these teams!
00:57:22 <DuB`> Guess I'll root for underdog
00:57:33 <Crisium> whos underdog?
00:57:34 <Crisium> same record
00:57:41 <DuB`> Agilites v Shadowburn both on genji is hnnng
00:57:52 <DuB`> Lotsa people think LAV is best western, I dunno
00:58:16 <Crisium> probably yeah
00:58:21 <Crisium> but shadowburn is best western human
00:58:27 <Crisium> so philly pretty good
00:59:07 <DuB`> Just praying for the not-afk GLA team next game...

01:01:14 <DuB`> GLA
01:01:19 <skram> ...
01:01:28 <DuB`> (The Purple Surefour Team)
01:01:32 <skram> LAG is much better
01:01:43 <Crisium> surefour is best human
01:01:51 <Crisium> not skill wise, but hes funy
01:01:51 <skram> surefour is a washed up has-been
01:01:55 <Crisium> rude
01:02:21 <DuB`> pff
01:02:28 <Crisium> he goes reaper in OWL, so
01:02:32 <Crisium> he knows the true meta
01:02:59 <skram> Dallas is the best team
01:03:00 <DuB`> The OG bastion pro
01:03:03 <skram> Too bad they're dead last
01:03:06 <Crisium> lmao
01:03:10 <Crisium> Dallas sucks

01:04:56 <skram> And then seagull showed up I guess lol
01:05:01 <DuB`> Dominant enough to make me bitter about it, so I'm enjoying them being bad a bit ;D
