01:21:54 <Bio> caramelize some fuckin onion boys
01:22:03 <Bio> in some red sherry
01:22:16 <skram> sherry and onions
01:22:18 <skram> what the fuck, over

01:23:07 <Bio> https://www.simplyrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/caramelize-onions-640-dm.jpg
01:23:11 <Bio> this
01:23:19 <Bio> sherry is just a type of red wine for cooking
01:23:36 <Bio> v sweet
01:23:39 <skram> its what old people drink bio
01:24:01 <Bio> yes, but when cooked with, you can make a type of caramel on the onions
01:24:06 <Bio> its delish
01:25:04 <Bio> https://www.mastercook.com/app/Image/15563025/4573960.jpg
01:25:15 <Bio> it was basically this but without the gravy/sause
01:26:47 <skram> i thought a hot blooded american such as yourself would use bourbon
01:26:51 <skram> this is FANCY cookin'
01:29:06 <Bio> yessir
01:29:42 <Bio> gotta blame the classically trained chef i worked with. lots of french cooking. lots of butter, cooking wine, eggs, ect
01:30:47 <Bio> though, when i was a younger lad, me and a few of my swimming friends did do our own version of epic meal time
01:31:05 <Bio> aka put jack daniels in fuckin everything
01:32:13 <skram> and bacon?
01:33:28 <Bio> very much so
01:34:54 <skram> attaboy
01:35:51 <Bio> and now i'm brought back to my other favorite cooking show on the internet
01:36:10 <Bio> Regular Ordinary Swedish Meal Time
01:36:16 <skram> YEAH
01:36:20 <Bio> hasn't made a vid in like 2 yrs tho
01:37:00 <skram> Skala potatisen MED DIN KROPP
01:37:01 <skram> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
01:37:13 <Bio> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L40f39bPII
01:38:47 <skram> is using snow for boiling potatos proper haute cuisine bio?
01:38:52 <Bio> yes
01:39:23 <skram> the part where he eats mayonnaise always make me cringe
01:39:26 <skram> di s g u sting
01:39:35 <Bio> but its good for you
01:40:10 <skram> nej :(
01:43:41 <skram> Add beer, if you want to
01:43:45 <skram> WE WONT, THIS IS REGULAR
01:48:58 <Bio> >Screaming in Sweenglish<
01:51:30 <Bio> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2s0aOhkjmY
01:51:35 <Bio> this one is probably my favorite
01:57:53 <Bio> Its PORK
01:57:56 <Bio> ON ITS SIDE
01:58:09 <skram> my least part of breakfast is that it takes like 45 minutes to clean up after making breakfast
01:58:15 <skram> least favorite part
01:58:42 <Bio> yea
01:59:05 <Bio> but the king would want his subjects to have a good hearty breakfast
02:00:12 <skram> of course
02:11:58 <Bio> the dbz crowd yelling with the chars in the intro is pretty hype
02:12:16 <Phearlock_> Yeah =D
02:23:15 <Bio> so....
02:23:23 <Bio> does dbz count as an anime fighter Kappa
02:24:33 <Cane> Bio, yeah I love that the whole crowd just yells with Cell.
02:24:52 <Cane> The fact that the DBFZ community just decided as a whole to let the intro run every time makes me happy. <3
02:26:14 <Bio> I know literally nothing about fighting games
02:26:20 <Bio> but the fgc is fun to watch
02:26:25 <Cane> Yeah man.
02:26:41 <Cane> 1v1 fighters is good at the whole storylines/epic comebacks/etc stuff.
02:26:55 <Phearlock_> It looks like they're all playing Tianhuo from fighting herds. Except also projectiles and assists =P
02:28:04 <Bio> what do the dragonballz do
02:28:40 <Phearlock_> it seems like if you get all of them you can call in some super stuff like reving characters or full healing
02:29:02 <Phearlock_> not sure how characters do that though, gathering them that is.
02:29:29 <Cane> Yeah it's rare.
02:29:40 <Cane> That's why when Go1 did it against SonicFox the whole stadium erupted.
02:29:46 <Phearlock_> yeah
02:29:47 <Cane> Doing that in like winner's finals takes some effort.
02:29:54 <Phearlock_> Dragon balls < Awoo
02:29:55 <Bio> interdasting
02:30:10 <Cane> You have to land some insane combos to get balls.
02:30:54 <Cane> There are some moves you can pull off to collect them.
02:31:05 <Cane> But mostly it's just super long combos.
02:31:10 <Cane> If you get 7 of them you can summon Shenron.
02:32:36 <Cane> Shenron will give you one of four different buffs.
02:38:24 <Cane> This game is slightly anime.
02:38:56 <Phearlock_> a little bit
02:41:08 <Cane> This is a crazy good grand finals so far.
02:41:23 <Cane> Go1 woke up.
02:41:28 <Phearlock_> yup
02:54:38 <Bio> go1 was giving him the evil eye
02:57:49 <Bio> 6 BALLS
02:57:53 <Bio> GET IT
02:58:16 <Cane> Bio wants it.
02:58:30 <Bio> theres 7
02:58:45 <Bio> do the thing!
02:59:45 <Cane> YEEEES.
02:59:47 <Bio> YO
03:00:03 <Cane> nasuirhlNO
03:00:12 <Cane> Pls kill him already.
03:01:08 <Cane> Level threeeeee?
03:01:28 <Phearlock_> PFffffffft
03:01:39 <Cane> Go1 had it and then he didn't.
03:05:18 <Phearlock_> Oh man we gonna have the reverse 3-0
03:05:20 <Phearlock_> ???
03:05:25 <Crisium> such dragon balls
03:09:15 <Cane> Dude's good.
03:09:22 <Phearlock_> Ge geeeeee
03:11:26 <Phearlock_> And now I think I shall head to bed

23:19:21 <Bio> nah that can't be it
23:19:28 <Dot`> its a heavy burden
23:20:15 <skram> .tell dub` BLEEP BLOOP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIpwbbkFi-8
23:32:47 <Dot`> i should sleep

23:33:32 <Dot`> no skram
23:33:45 <Dot`> its at Cougar automation
23:34:29 <skram> what do they do
23:34:46 <Dot`> automate things
23:34:48 -!- tredc [~tredc@c83-251-163-99.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
23:35:04 <skram> obviously
23:35:06 <skram> what sort of things
23:35:47 <Dot`> mainly the control system programming,  which isnt really mt thing, but they are partnered with a company that doesn all the actual systems
23:36:07 <Dot`> they focus in water treatment plants and power, but also do some other stuff
23:37:57 <skram> so lots of HMI-things and SCADA and such
23:38:20 <Dot`> i dont even know what those mean
23:39:09 <skram> control system interfaces
23:39:18 <skram> like the ones you have in a control room
23:40:16 <Dot`> nah, they do the actual programming and thier [artner company does the physical parts of the systems
23:40:43 <skram> human machine interfaces are a part of the actual programming, silly
23:41:58 <Dot`> well that depends if your talking about the mouse or the mouse pointer
23:42:10 <Dot`> both are part of te same interface
23:43:35 <skram> i think most modern PLCs with operator screens/HMI are all programmed within the same program
23:44:11 <skram> actually im quite certain of it
23:46:54 <Dot`> im sure it makes sense to you skram, but to I, a man who works in a sweet shop, nope
23:47:21 <skram> :P
23:47:43 <skram> you'll learn all of the things soon enough i think
23:48:10 <Dot`> not if no one hires me
23:48:25 <skram> they will though
