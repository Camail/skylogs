00:46:49 <Phearlock> duuuuub
00:47:13 <Phearlock> I said I felt sorry for you in discord too but poor you
00:47:27 <Phearlock> Travel delays always annoying D=
00:56:54 <DuB`> :T
01:00:54 <DuB`> LA an NYC next week lolol
01:24:20 <Dot> dub
01:24:27 <Dot> glad your not dead
01:26:02 <DuB`> Same!
01:26:06 <DuB`> You are still awake :O
01:26:25 <skram> we're bad bois with no curfew
01:26:28 <skram> we can do what we want DuB`
01:26:41 <DuB`> I'm no critic, it means I get to talk to you more!
01:26:56 <skram> how was plane
01:27:13 <DuB`> I took 4 seperate naps today
01:27:14 <DuB`> Was fine
01:28:09 <skram> did you get the gig though
01:34:52 <DuB`> Probly, dunno when those details will be
01:48:54 <Camail> we shot so many people
01:50:29 <skram> SO many
01:50:30 <DuB`> D:
01:50:42 <DuB`> Where!
01:50:54 <Camail> in cs
01:51:15 <Camail> i used my wiles to convince him to play 2v2
01:51:19 <DuB`> Aha
01:53:37 <skram> i buckle under pressure
01:56:16 <DuB`> Easily seduced
01:56:26 <Camail> very
01:57:07 <skram> i want to build me a modular synthesizer DuB`
01:57:18 <DuB`> o my
01:57:35 <skram> but at some point i should probably stop trying to compensate for my lack of musical ability with things that do the noises
01:57:40 <skram> but its so cool though
01:57:42 <skram> SO cool
01:57:59 <DuB`> And then you can make a youtube channel called Look Mor No Computer
01:58:09 <skram> heeheh
01:58:40 <skram> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjYENsrLLf4 look
01:59:07 <skram> how cool is this, its a thing with 900 buttons and twirly bits, flashing lights and a buncha cables that make the most soothing bloops
01:59:31 <DuB`> I'm sure you could do non-soothing bloops as well.
02:00:14 <skram> course, this collection of flashing lights is probably 3000 dollarydoos+
02:07:49 <skram> hmm im gonna build this 8step sequencer on his site and see what happens
02:36:06 <skram> but i'd need something that gets triggered by CV signals
02:36:13 <skram> so then i'd have to make an oscillator
02:36:19 <skram> see DuB` this is how you go broke
02:36:55 <DuB`> (:
02:37:12 <DuB`> All u need is sines and saws
02:39:00 <skram> they do make the bleeps
02:39:07 <skram> and also the bloops
