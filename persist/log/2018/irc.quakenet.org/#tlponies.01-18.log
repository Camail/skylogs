15:53:24 <skram> here too bud
15:53:57 <Dot`> i need to start prep for DnD soon
15:54:52 <skram> I tested the generators today and it tripped the HV breakers when it tried to desync from the grid
15:55:02 <skram> total blackout
15:55:03 <Dot`> oh dear
15:55:04 <skram> very exciting
15:55:07 <Dot`> HAHA
15:55:13 <Dot`> thast amazing
15:55:31 <Dot`> did you casue an area blackout? or just your plant
15:55:43 <skram> just the plant
15:56:01 <skram> SCADA is on UPS so that worked too, but no lights or anything
15:56:34 <skram> all steam redirected to emergency release line
15:56:35 <skram> much noise
15:56:39 <Dot`> so they failed the test then 
15:57:27 <skram> Naw the backup generator worked as it should, you're just not able to switch back to the grid without total failure
15:57:44 <Dot`> which i would thhink is important
15:57:49 <Runbunny> Did you say vampire lolis ?!?! http://danbooru.donmai.us/data/sample/__rachel_alucard_blazblue_and_blazblue_cross_tag_battle__sample-19ff35f5910cbe16786c4f7e811831b6.jpg
