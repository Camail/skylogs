17:08:53 <Dot`> internet
17:09:14 <Dot`> it all started about 3 days ago with a hat
17:09:31 <Zounds> he's not a girl he just looks like one
17:10:16 <Golly> Bowser does have a thing for traps
17:16:12 <Runbunny> Jonas.
17:16:21 <Runbunny> It's because of the crown.
17:17:25 <Runbunny> Here is a tweet of the guy who started it all https://twitter.com/ayyk92/status/1043855759904202752
17:19:07 <skram> well
17:19:17 <skram> its not gay if your best bro turns into a girl
17:20:58 <Runbunny> it's gay again if you also turn into a girl.
17:21:55 <skram> thats alright
17:29:35 <Runbunny> Just look Jonas.
17:29:36 <Runbunny> https://twitter.com/ermame26/status/1043917479452409856?s=20
17:30:27 <skram> thats pretty lewd, anders
17:31:30 <Runbunny> It's pretty mild, I'd say.
17:32:31 <Runbunny> But I have probably been desensitized.

18:31:10 <Zounds> I'm not dissing anime tits in general just the giant ones
18:31:45 <Zounds> though tbh that applies to both anime and 3d for me
18:32:05 <Zounds> not that anybody is interested

18:33:34 <Camail> i wonder if nintendo knew what they were doing
18:33:35 <skram> piano-chan
18:33:38 <skram> my fave
18:33:47 <Zounds> isn't it supposed to make them look like peach
18:34:15 <Camail> boo waifu is probably my favorite
18:34:34 <Runbunny> Just making them a princess I guess. I don't know the specifics.
18:34:44 <Camail> well we only have 1 reference pic
18:34:53 <Camail> and its changing a girl toad into a girl human
18:35:17 <Camail> so there really aren't any rules with a sample size of 1
18:38:54 <Runbunny> I just saw the trailer, maybe something will happen if you multiplay and get toadette to spawn the crown and luigi picks it up.
18:39:00 <Runbunny> But probably not.
18:40:11 <Zounds> king luigi rules with an iron fist
18:40:17 <Camail> if they weren't gonna do it before, they might now
18:42:38 <Runbunny> Hmm. You can apparently get mario in a wedding dress in Odyssey. So they might actually do it.

19:14:07 <Phearlock> That is some good cute pone Dot
19:14:15 <reification> step 1. add a text message step to your promotion making it less secure for no good reason
