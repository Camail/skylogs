01:35:33 <Camail> is mines of phandelver a dwarf thing
01:35:52 <Camail> if not, just make everyone a dwarf
02:04:51 <Camail> oh dub  i think i came up with something for you to think about with velvet
02:05:08 <Camail> dont think about when you want to attack, think about when your opponent wants to attack
02:05:38 <Camail> its gonna be different for each character, but it's your job to tell them to stfu and sit down, and slap them if they start doing stupid stuff
02:05:58 <Camail> you never want to get close so you dont have a grab game, meaning you have to hit people
02:06:41 <Camail> which means you have to hit them when they are in the start up frames of a jump, with an anti-air, or if they are trying to dash forward
02:07:26 <Camail> or other things
02:08:19 <Camail> that's on top of the general strategy that zoners use, which is to occupy specific zones of the screen with projectiles and force the opponent to approach from one or two specific angles that you have a reactionary response to
