13:36:19 <Bunny> Hai Reif.
13:37:08 <reification> hello stationary bun
13:37:54 <Bunny> It's rough Reif. 
13:38:28 <Bunny> Cell won't behave as I would like. Something I thought that could be done in 2 days will take at least 5.
13:43:03 <reification> oh dear
13:46:23 <Bunny> Plus it's really expensive and if it doesn't work well enough, I'm boned.
13:46:31 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
13:49:33 <reification> gl bun
13:49:52 <reification> what exactly should the cells be doing?
13:55:43 <Bunny> They should be taking up my plasmids and expressing them when I introduce pores in their cell membrane by electricity. But they aren't. My currenty idea is that even though they are fresh, they need to grow for a few days before that will accept the plasmids. 
13:56:37 <CockRoach|42> have you tried turning it off and on again?
13:56:42 * CockRoach|42 helpful
13:56:49 <Bunny> Human T-cells from fresh donors are apparently against it.
13:57:17 <Bunny> The thing is, CockRoach, that if you turn them off, they stay turned off. 
13:57:28 <CockRoach|42> oh... that's not good
13:57:37 <reification> sounds like shoddy design to me
13:57:40 <CockRoach|42> ^
13:57:54 <CockRoach|42> i hope it's fixed in the next revision
13:57:58 <Bunny> But yes, I have blasted 2500 volts through them, kills them pretty good.

13:58:48 <reification> heh
13:59:06 <Bunny> well actually it doesn't really kill the T-cells since they are tough as shit.
13:59:30 <Bunny> Picture is apropriate
14:01:06 <reification> “artificial plasmids are widely used as vectors in molecular cloning”
14:01:22 <reification> will you be using this to make catgirls soon
14:03:17 <Bunny> Well human cells don't usually have plasmids, so they are degraded after a while. 
14:03:45 <Bunny> The idea is to modify the genome permenantly.
14:05:09 <Bunny> There are 2 issues, delivery into the targets cells and editing the genome.
14:05:24 <Bunny> with a high effieciency.
14:05:44 <reification> ah https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation
14:06:43 <Bunny> That is one way to do it. But problems arise, when you try electroporate stem cells, as it may cause them to differentiate.
14:07:08 <Bunny> Ideally we want the stem cells to remain stem cells.
14:07:56 <reification> hmm definitely seems tricky
14:08:01 <Bunny> We could target fetuses very early, when they are just a few cells. 
14:08:34 <Bunny> but humans grow slowly and ethically it's very across the line of what is allowed.
14:08:54 <CockRoach|42> wow Bunny is part of big pharma!!!
14:09:26 <reification> ethics always spoiling the fun stuff 
14:09:43 <CockRoach|42> :)
14:10:10 <Bunny> I have premission from the ethical commite of Denmark to do what I do right now. Cat girls are a bit off the table atm.
14:11:04 <reification> clearly the solution is to infiltrate the committee 
14:11:15 <Bunny> Given some time and money I could probably make a cat mouse, but I haven't looked into the specific genetics yet.
14:12:32 <Bunny> I think it's a general thing that you never clear yourself for anything.
14:13:16 <Bunny> But I agree Reif, they could use some new blood to make it better.
14:13:51 <reification> well now i’m looking up mousegirls on danbooru
14:14:27 <Bunny> Nazrin? :3
14:14:39 <reification> almost all are 
14:14:53 <Bunny> what about catmouses?
14:15:03 <Bunny> Catmice?
14:15:38 <reification> they might get confused and try self canibalism!
14:17:45 <reification> just getting chen x nazrin
14:18:00 <Bunny> I like the other cat better.
14:18:55 <reification> the one who drags you to hell?
14:19:47 <Bunny> Yeah

19:37:03 <Phearlock_> yeah I think so too
19:37:05 <Zounds> It's gonna be grim if I continue climbing then try a solo drop
19:37:08 <Phearlock_> I wonder if it matters =P
19:37:17 <Zounds> yeh I dunno how it works really
19:37:25 <Zounds> we do fight people I know to be in tier 1 in group drops
19:38:39 <Zounds> though if that's where everybody ends up no matter what maybe it'll be fine haha
19:39:26 <Phearlock_> I think that's where everyone who plays regularly ends up yeah
19:41:54 <Zounds> inv me next drop Phearlock_ 
19:41:57 <Zounds> I was just eating a bit
19:42:09 <Phearlock_> not on right now
19:42:25 <Zounds> oh, my ui lies then
19:54:08 <Phearlock_> I did have a bunch of cbills saved up so bought a bushwacker
19:54:37 <Phearlock_> Very impressed so far, its like a heavy mech with great hitboxes =P
19:55:44 <Zounds> yeah it seems to be a popular and solid mech
19:56:23 <Phearlock_> Kinda ezmode defensively as your best bet is to generally point straight at the target =P
19:56:43 <Phearlock_> Maybe strafe a bit to keep the legs from being an easy shot
19:57:59 <Zounds> yeh they are tougher than they look
19:58:27 <Zounds> I'm sitting on about 10million cbills atm still figuring out what I want next
19:58:44 <Zounds> Need to finish skilling my Cicada before I buy anything else though
19:59:40 <Zounds> I enjoy playing the Cicada but sometimes there's just not enough time to do good damage in a match heh
19:59:53 <Phearlock_> It is true
20:00:38 <Zounds> 2 mins rolling my face on the keyboard on my jaeger does about as much as spending the match poking away on the cicada
20:01:09 <Zounds> if I can lunge in to stop wounded mechs from escaping with my speed and LMG i do feel like i'm contributing more though
20:01:13 <Phearlock_> Some mechs you cannot find satisfaction in the damage numbers
20:01:14 <Zounds> but that's quite tricky to do sometimes
20:01:25 <Phearlock_> and have to focus on having fun with how annoying you're being to the other team
20:02:28 <Zounds> It is funny seeing how different pilots react
20:06:56 <Zounds> i'm too much of a cheapskate to use consumables
20:07:08 <Zounds> but the cicada does get into good positions to place them :P
20:07:16 <Phearlock_> yeah

22:40:40 <carcinisation> giving dub power :O
22:41:06 <Crisium> being mod in a OWL player channel = 1 step away from OWL
22:41:09 <Crisium> thats how it works
22:41:13 <DuB`> No sure4 stream in almost 3 weeks now D:
22:41:32 <DuB`> I'm also his longest sub haha
22:41:35 <Crisium> well they are trying to get stage 4 and final playoffs both, probably intense scrimming
22:41:53 <DuB`> Mhmm
22:41:54 <Crisium> DuB` biggest fanboi confirmed
22:44:33 <Camail> the question is, fan or fucc
22:44:43 <skram> can you be both
22:45:10 <Camail> nah
22:45:37 <Camail> if you are too much of a fan you become a fucc
22:46:06 <Camail> also i just had a hunt where they didnt attack the tail on stagger 
22:46:08 <Camail> i was so mad
22:46:13 <Camail> literally always break the tail
22:46:31 <Camail> makes their moveset worse, gives mats that you NEED
22:46:32 <Camail> sigh
22:47:59 <skram> did you yell at them
22:48:20 <Camail> talking to randos? ew
23:05:09 <DuB`> OWL live thank goodness
23:13:27 <Crisium> can boston go 0-7?
23:13:30 <Crisium> guessing yes
23:19:07 <DuB`> Cris, I dunno who to root for in this one! Seoul win migh be a bit better for LA, but I like boston because HuKteam
23:19:40 <skram> boston
23:19:41 <skram> obviously
23:21:14 <Crisium> they are both playoff threats to Gladiators
23:21:24 <skram> fuk the glads tho
