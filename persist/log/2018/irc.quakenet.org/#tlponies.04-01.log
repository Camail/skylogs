00:42:09 <Bio> like, are they not inviting him to practice?
00:42:57 <DuB`> Dunno

16:13:04 <DuB`> Just finished out the copper patch with miners+furnaces
16:13:28 <DuB`> Then went and practiced winston in quickplay and tracer in deathmatch for like 4 hours :P
16:13:41 <Crisium> dub is a diver
16:13:44 <Dot`> so much gaming
16:13:54 <DuB`> Winston is hard
16:14:01 <DuB`> Think I'm figuring him out though
16:14:06 <Zounds> Cris and I lost 50 SR yesterday for no reason
16:14:10 <Zounds> I'm still mad about it
16:14:20 <Crisium> we actually gained a lot too, before the loss streaks
16:14:29 <Crisium> there was a reason zounds
16:14:34 <Crisium> people didnt know how to play tanks
16:14:47 <Zounds> No I don't mind our win/loss that was fine
16:14:50 <Zounds> But the mystery SR we lost
16:14:53 <Crisium> oh yeah
16:14:57 <Zounds> after leaving that game that was allowed to be left
16:15:03 <Crisium> yeah we lost 50 SR in a game
16:15:16 <Dot`> all i recall for winston is. Jump in, Hope team follows
16:15:27 <Crisium> yes dot thats it lol
16:15:41 <Dot`> im practicly GM
16:15:57 <Zounds> I've been having a lot of fun on ol' Winnie lately too
16:16:00 <Crisium> even OWL Winstons feed constantly tho
16:16:10 <DuB`> Haha
16:16:13 <Crisium> feeding is part of the winston life, but the best winstons feed less or get good trades
16:16:27 <DuB`> The games that go best on him I'm surprised how much time I spend just sort of... waiting?
16:16:42 <Crisium> waiting for your dva to dive with you ;)
16:17:39 <Zounds> Yeah some games are about waiting to counter dive or something for example
16:17:45 <Zounds> Others it seems like you never let go of left click
16:21:44 <DuB`> Primal Rage is such a good ult
16:22:05 <DuB`> I like how it's good without being one of the "kill-em-all" ults like blade/grav/tire
16:22:06 <Crisium> i remember when people used to think it was the worst in the game lol
16:22:55 <DuB`> NOTHING can stall disrupt like 1000hp with a 1sec cooldown jump and boop attack
16:23:04 <DuB`> stall or disrupt*
16:23:21 <Zounds> Back in the early days you got a 4-5K with almost every death blossom cris
16:23:24 <Crisium> 2 second cooldown, but yeah its nice at times
16:23:25 <Zounds> People were fuckin' dumb

17:45:25 <skrm> if you leave them alone even for a second they will burn your fucking house down
17:45:28 <Crisium> im QP right now
17:45:35 <Crisium> on NA
17:46:12 <Zounds> neat
17:47:50 <Zounds> DuB` come OW then
17:47:55 <DuB`> yas
17:47:56 <Zounds> Though we should totes get a dota stack going
17:48:01 <Zounds> at some point soon
17:48:50 <DuB`> Bointy Hunter must roam the lands once more
17:49:05 <Zounds> I forget who I liked
17:49:11 <Zounds> Lion and that guy who steals spells
17:49:12 <Zounds> Rubick?
17:49:28 <DuB`> Lion is just a not-pretty Lina >:T
17:50:02 <Zounds> I liked him because he can drain mana to keep casting
17:50:05 <Zounds> and his stun was easy to hit
17:54:19 <skrm> lina stun is easier now i think
18:04:25 <Phearlock> Any favorites for april fools this year?
18:06:14 <Zounds> Havent seen that many
18:06:21 <Zounds> The 4 chan one is annoying though
18:06:41 <Phearlock> Derpibooru is very soviet
18:07:11 <Crisium> makes sense since it used to be .ru
18:07:13 <Phearlock> Subreddit drama has converted to a furry subreddit and their automod bot removes any comment that isn't furry enough.
18:07:16 <Crisium> https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2016/3/17/1111157.jpeg
18:07:58 <Zounds> 4chan assigned posters random teams and gave them a scoreboard based on the amount of mentions
18:08:07 <Zounds> then displayed a scoreboard at the top of each board
18:08:16 <Phearlock> cute
18:08:16 <Zounds> It's genius and everyone immediately drew lines in the sand
18:08:25 <Zounds> but you can't actually read anything there
18:08:27 <Zounds> just spam
18:08:55 <Phearlock> Starcitizen and Elite dangerous swapped reddit themes
18:09:06 <Phearlock> nothing big but cute =3
18:12:05 <skrm> did you hear about the new coca cola flavours though
18:12:14 <skrm> avocado, charcoal, and sourdough
18:16:13 <Phearlock> I would legitimately try an avocado cola

19:34:00 <Dot`> thats a rabbit bio
19:35:23 <DuB`> Can factori whenever
19:35:26 <DuB`> Or play whatever
19:45:24 <skrm> Can you play the music of my people
19:46:11 <Runbunny> Hmmm.
19:46:41 <Runbunny> I don't think I have anything good to show you at the moment, Jonas.
19:47:45 <DuB`> Mebbe I doto bot game do figure out how on earth that game works again.
20:24:05 <Dot`> skrm
20:24:11 <skrm> yeah buddy
20:24:16 <Dot`> hows work
20:24:23 <carcinisation> if doto is return i will play this time
20:24:37 <skrm> boring
20:24:40 <skrm> shit keeps breaking
20:24:50 <Dot`> oh dear
20:25:00 <Dot`> isnt it your job to make it not break?
20:25:05 <carcinisation> sounds good bun. i used to be church bellringer in my youth
20:26:05 <skrm> cant fix subpar danish engineering, Dot` 
20:26:41 <Dot`> i tohught you liked benny the danish guy, or whatever his name was
20:27:34 <skrm> oh yeah, he's swell
20:27:43 <skrm> this is a different danish engineering firm
20:27:47 <skrm> that went bankrupt
20:29:11 <Dot`> you mean there plan to sell stuff that breaks so they could sell more stuff that breaks failed?

20:30:17 <skrm> Its not a good business strategy if you replace their parts with things that actually work
20:30:22 <skrm> made by other people
20:30:37 <Dot`> if only they had thought of this
20:30:45 <Runbunny> Sounds like you got scammed.
20:32:33 <skrm> probably
20:38:29 <Zounds> Are the bots withstanding your might dub?
20:38:33 <Zounds> Or do they fall in defeat
20:41:51 <Phearlock> Been a long time since doto
20:42:28 <carcinisation> was techies in the game then?
20:43:07 <Phearlock> I can't remember
20:48:35 <BioPhone> Pony... doto?
20:49:13 <BioPhone> This is an ancient staw
20:49:15 <BioPhone> Staq
20:51:33 <Runbunny> Techies was not in the game back then.
21:08:50 <DuB`> The doto bots were vanquished. 
21:08:56 <DuB`> Took forever though >_>
21:09:02 <DuB`> Teammate bots are also bad.
21:09:57 <Zounds> dota has talents now :O
21:09:58 <Zounds> watf
21:11:51 <DuB`> Ye I like those
21:12:00 <DuB`> Instead of putting level points into stats or whatever
21:12:03 <DuB`> Much more interesting
21:23:36 <skrm> We defeated denmark, Dot` 
21:23:41 <skrm> despite their infernal designs
21:24:17 <Dot`> im proud of you
21:24:43 <BioPhone> Well done skram
21:32:02 <Runbunny> Did you really skram?
21:32:13 <Runbunny> Or are we going to haunt you forever? :3
21:32:56 <skrm> Its true
21:33:05 <skrm> It will always be there, lurking in the shadows
21:33:45 <Runbunny> Then we are never truly defeated :D
21:36:01 <carcinisation> have you stopped paying the danegeld skrm?
21:36:36 <skrm> pfft
21:36:41 <carcinisation> i hear that's important in these kind of cases
21:37:14 <skrm> no dane shall ever put their fat fingers in our treasures again
21:47:01 <Zounds> I rather enjoyed playing no crosshair McCree earlier
21:47:06 <Zounds> I think you should try it dub
21:47:15 <Zounds> It's waaaaaaay easier than you might initially think
21:48:32 <Zounds> In a strange way it's actually a bit easier at close range since you have no obfuscation of your target at all
21:48:38 <Zounds> even those few pixels seem to make a difference
22:11:14 <Dot`> too hardcore for me
22:13:56 <DuB`> doot doot
22:14:05 <Dot`> dub
22:30:27 <skrm> dub
22:30:39 <Dot`> dub
22:50:20 <DuB`> wha
