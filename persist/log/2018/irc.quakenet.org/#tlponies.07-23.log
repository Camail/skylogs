00:31:21 <Dot> poni
00:38:07 <Camail> i got a key for mtga as well
00:38:25 <Camail> i've just been doing free play with an awful deck brew
00:38:31 <Camail> still havent found something i really enjoy
00:39:10 <Camail> went with the big green starter deck but that thing was way too straight forward, really no agency
00:40:07 <Camail> i like playing fast, but if i really cared i'd just have to net deck and find something like that
00:40:23 <Camail> i really don't know enough about the card pool to brew, let alone brewing with what you get for free
00:42:04 <Golly> does brew mean just making your own deck?
00:42:46 <Camail> well it's just the act of making a deck, yea
00:42:55 <Camail> it's basically theorycraft
00:43:11 <Camail> .mtg
00:43:21 <Camail> .mtg bristling hydra
00:43:31 <Camail> boo
00:43:41 <Camail> .mtg counterspell
00:43:51 <Dot> welp, she failed, time to kill swoots
00:43:58 <skram> D:
00:44:01 <skram> MURDERER
00:44:14 <Camail> maybe the site it used changed its api or doesnt exist
00:44:16 <Camail> it is an old bot
00:44:40 <Camail> sure wish there was a proper log for her tracebacks, but w/e
00:45:09 <Camail> if there was one thing i would end up actually changing, it's that.
00:46:27 <Camail> but yea, bristling hydra is 2gg 4/3 that comes into play with 3 energy, and you can spend 3 energy to give it a +1/+1 counter and hexproof until end of turn
00:46:31 <Camail> and i think thats really neat
00:47:12 <Camail> i like messing with counters, but haven't found a fast way of doing it.
00:47:25 <Camail> i actually got fucking milled out yesterday
00:47:44 <Camail> someone bought the mill deck before they even started to play quick play
00:57:25 <Camail> hmm, dose this work https://youtu.be/-Ine-ZApwF8
00:57:43 <Camail> yay regex
00:57:54 <Camail> also yea, even wrestlers are playing DnD now
00:58:04 <Camail> which makes sense cuz its just violent theater
