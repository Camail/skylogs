23:24:14 <Crisium> pl0x
23:35:27 <carcinisation> nicely done cris
23:38:57 <DuB`> I should do my placements]
23:39:17 <DuB`> So I can duo with skram, go on a 10-win streak, get masters, and then stop playing for the rest of the season :P
23:39:31 <DuB`> Just like last time!
23:44:59 <skram> heck yeah
23:45:03 <Camail> TL is 1-2 at the major
23:45:10 <skram> we played with halvorg too didnt we
23:45:13 <Camail> it just sucks because they aren't allowed to use their full roster
23:45:27 <Camail> they made a change after the deadline so their coach is a stand in
23:45:42 <Camail> so this major is kind of a joke for some fans
23:48:28 <DuB`> skram: The crazy masters run we did started with zounds I think, but he left after 2-3 and we kept winning for like 3x that many
23:52:57 <Bio> HUZZAH MURDER
23:53:13 <skram> oh yah thats true DuB`
23:53:30 <skram> we likked 19 dudes i think
23:53:35 <skram> killed
23:53:38 <skram> ???
23:55:05 <Dot`> more overall
23:55:16 <Dot`> at least none where innocents, yet
23:55:25 <skram> there's still time
23:57:08 <Dot`> yea skram, i originaly thought, about 2 hours in town then break, and come back to 2 hours in the dungeon
23:57:21 <Dot`> instead, 3 hours of lureing bandits to thier deaths
23:57:34 <skram> we did spend about 2 hours fucking around though
23:58:07 <Bio> Bretty normal for dnd tbh
23:58:20 <Dot`> dynamic lighting worked good?
23:58:48 <skram> yeah boii
