01:59:30 <Bio> that there is a good hat
01:59:52 <Bio> Skrammen the Undying
01:59:54 <Bio> what a pro
02:08:31 <Runbunny> Jonas you're lowest on damage.
02:08:53 <Runbunny> Last boss of Tol dagor is a bitch on mythic.
02:10:18 <Bio> theres a couple hard ones atm
02:10:31 <Bio> the zappy pillar boi in the snek place was rough at first
02:10:49 <Runbunny> ahh yes.
02:11:36 <Runbunny> However it is not helped by dbm going bonkers when you get 6 stacks but you can easily take like 12 stacks.
02:15:54 <skram> Runbunny im the healer
02:16:17 <Runbunny> Since when was that an excuse?
02:16:40 <skram> ok ill let the lads die instead
02:16:46 <skram> anders told me damage was importanter
02:16:54 <Runbunny> Like affliction warlock AoE is so shit that I get destroyed by holy nova.
02:17:21 <skram> surprising amount of damage
02:17:43 <skram> i usually stay ahead of tank on damage by smiting which is kinda dumb
02:19:45 <Runbunny> I do a shit load of damage on single target, but AoE I am below the tank and or healer.
02:20:51 <skram> what class is you
02:23:16 <Runbunny> Warlock.
