22:55:15 <Camail> ugh, i dont need another cavity search
22:55:19 <Camail> those get old, fast
22:57:27 <Crisium> yeah that was one crazy dental exam
22:57:50 <Crisium> dunno why they thought they'd find cavities there
23:13:06 <Camail> i was playing sf5 yesterday and it was rough, i was using mp+mk to tech
23:13:18 <Camail> tfh fucked up my muscle memory for like 30 minutes
23:16:41 <Crisium> mike ross does not approve
23:16:48 <Crisium> did you check out his AMA? lol
23:17:21 <Crisium> If you ever wanted to know why you haven't seen Mike Ross in a while "I didn¬ít leave solely because of this but yes. I, arrogantly, thought I could change esports and make it ¬ìblacker¬î (Damon Wayans bamboozled reference). But no, the powers at be want esports to look and feel a certain way. I¬ím okay with that, but I can¬ít change anymore than I already had to fit in. Fuck that, I¬íd rather be broke and homeless on the streets than to suck dick and be somethin
23:17:21 <Crisium> g I¬ím not.
23:17:21 <Crisium>  
23:17:21 <Crisium> Sfv is one of the worst fighting games I ever played. This is no secret but I held my tongue as I didn¬ít want to hurt/affect any of my friends that were working at capcom at the time. But now that I have no friends working there I can say w/e the fuck I want. What are they gonna do? Blacklist me? Looooooool. Guess y¬íall won¬ít see me in any of their esports/tmz media integrations in the future. At least not for fucking sfv.
23:17:27 <Crisium>  
23:17:28 <Crisium> If you do like the game more power to you. Anybody who¬ís an 18er will play sfv and be like ¬ìthis game is FARKINF AMAZINGGG¬î and that¬ís okay! To each their own."

23:35:18 <Camail> he can play the victim all he wants while dbfz goes huge, tekken 7 is bigger than any other tekken game has ever been, arc sys has 4 of the 8 fighting games at evo
23:35:23 <Camail> its a pure victim play
23:35:46 <Camail> he doesnt like sf5 and is feeding the r/kappa crowd cuz he's an idiot
23:38:48 <Camail> if sf5 didnt have just as high of a skill ceiling as sf4 we wouldn't be seeing the same faces, it's just another capcom fighting game
23:40:08 <Crisium> thats different from liking it tho
23:40:19 <Crisium> if you like sf4 a lot, arc sys and tekken wont be up your ally
23:41:13 <Crisium> the quote here is more of the main reason he left: https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2018/mar/25/i-had-break-fgc-because-i-dont-recognize-it-anymore-mike-ross-breaks-silence-why-he-left-twitch-and-fighting-game-community/
23:41:27 <Crisium> dislike of sfv is just what i highlited cause lul
23:47:16 <Camail> that's still quite a victim complex, saying "its not your fault for ignoring me, its my fault for expecting you to really care" doesn't get much sympathy from me
23:47:45 <Camail> yea the gold-digging nature of fame sucks
23:47:53 <Camail> but he's still clearly very angry at a lot of people
23:48:19 <Camail> which is fine, hopefully he figures shit out
23:49:29 <Camail> also something he says doesn't quite add up "capcom shut down CPT because it wasn't making money, so I killed it"
23:50:00 <Camail> ah well, i dont want to dissect it anymore, that wont lead to anything useful for anyone
23:50:10 <Crisium> they made him kill it
23:50:30 <Crisium> oh, maybe not
23:50:38 <Crisium> might have been spite because capcom told him that, dunno
23:51:44 <Camail> its possible, nay probable, that this was a rant and sometimes he is just kinda rambling
23:52:36 <Camail> also dbfz is 10000% in the category of watch but NEVER player for me
23:52:54 <DuB`> That's a lotta percent.
23:52:59 <Camail> the lack of pushblock in a hyper fighter, i just cant comprehend it
