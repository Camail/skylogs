22:57:19 <skram> sounds like a good time
22:58:00 <Bio> I believe that roll 20 has a horde module
22:59:42 <Dot`> its like 50 dollars
23:00:27 <skram> Well, Dot`
23:00:37 <Dot`> hi skram
23:01:13 <Bio> that is for both modules
23:01:20 <Bio> 300 hours of PREP
23:01:22 <Bio> so much
23:01:25 <Dot`> haha
23:01:36 <Dot`> yea, thats one reason i decided to not run Hoard
23:01:42 <Bio> I wouldn't have to do ANYTHING
23:02:45 <skram> If you wanted to run one of those roll20 modules your players would be happy to buy it since DMing is the difficult bit
23:03:29 <Dot`> yea, thast probably the best thing to do
23:03:42 <Bio> If people wanted to run that after this one, lets GO
23:04:32 <Bio> and we are still on the sword coast
23:04:36 <Dot`> you saying you want to dnd DM for us after LMOP?
23:04:43 <Bio> yeah bud
23:04:53 <skram> I'd like to do a thing where I can continue to play vakist
23:05:16 <Dot`> skram likes his cleric? i feel proud
23:05:26 <skram> And not start at level 1 :P
23:05:31 <Bio> haha
23:06:05 <Bio> its SUPPOSED to be a start at lvl 1 and at the end of it all be lvl 8 or so
23:06:09 <Bio> i bet we can figure something out
23:06:18 <skram> Well both my barb campaigns ended right before level 5 where i can attack twice
23:06:23 <Dot`> well the whole hoard goes to like lvl 18
23:07:48 <Dot`> does it not have those optional start levels bio? the modules ive checked have all had optional 1-3 areas
23:08:46 <Bio> this one doesn't really, and the first 3 chapters are pretty big setup
23:09:20 <Bio> even the first episode is pretty memorable
23:09:53 <Dot`> i kinda like lvl 1-3
23:10:24 <Dot`> but gettgin a campagn past that seems tricky
23:10:32 <Dot`> toppling occurs
23:10:37 <Bio> rofl

23:11:58 <Camail> FLUSHA
23:12:11 <Bio> he's ok at the game I thing
23:12:14 <Bio> think
23:12:46 <Dot`> cam, i beat some easy bots yesterday 
23:12:52 <Dot`> by button mashing!
23:12:58 <Dot`> creating space is hard
23:13:11 <Camail> your air normals are so good tho
23:13:42 <Bio> gonna go to gym
23:13:45 <Bio> brb later
23:13:54 <Dot`> i go into it with a plan and then it falls apart as soon as i start
23:13:57 <Dot`> later bio
23:16:16 <Camail> so the bots suck
23:16:22 <Camail> play against real people with real reactions
23:16:32 <Camail> playing against bots greatly skews your playstyle
23:16:51 <Camail> you cant make space vs a bot because they never get scared of being hit
23:17:03 <Camail> they either let you hit them or space it perfectly and walk forward until you hit a button
23:17:17 <Dot`> i guess
23:19:09 <Camail> no, not i guess. I am telling you this
23:19:23 <Camail> this is how bots are programmed
23:19:41 <Camail> they are useless after the first 5 hours of playing a character
23:20:07 <Camail> use that info however you want
23:20:41 <Dot`> well maybe i play against ppl tomorow, maybe phear, maybe you
23:20:44 <Dot`> we shall see
23:21:02 <Dot`> but i tihnk you will be bored
23:22:14 <Camail> I palyed 30 games with phear
23:22:19 <Camail> who has enver played a fighting game before
23:22:48 <Dot`> oh, i tohught he played one of the street fighters 
23:23:46 <Camail> there is a line that people cross as they gain experience, no one but me and crisium have crossed that in tlp
23:24:02 <Camail> so you are all on the same level
23:24:09 <Crisium> huh
23:24:50 <Camail> I'm you know what footsies are
23:24:54 <Camail> I'm saying*
23:25:04 <Crisium> playing with someone's feet under the table
23:25:09 <Crisium> do it at work sometimes in meetings
23:29:58 <Camail> Dot`  i know playing against real people is nerve wracking, it really is. start with facing a friend in tlp, strangers are scarier
23:30:24 <Camail> I play much better vs people , and a strong factor is nerves
23:42:53 <Camail> better vs people i know*
