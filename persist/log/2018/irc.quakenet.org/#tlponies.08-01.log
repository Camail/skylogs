00:03:27 <skram> :(
00:03:38 <Phearlock_> Hope they're doing alright, whever they are
00:04:43 <skram> hear hear
00:38:22 <skram> .tell dub` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijE029DIfZA I GROW TIRED OF YOUR BLEEPS AND BLOOPS
00:45:26 <skram> Cane, im stuck on the early new wave stuff again.
00:45:45 <Camail> doing the atlas path is a good way to get the language milestones
00:45:50 <Camail> only 17 words away
00:45:58 <skram> I went to the local record store and those albums are crazy expensive now
00:46:13 <Cane> skram, currently listening to synthwave as I write. I'm gonna run out of YouTube eventually.
00:46:13 <skram> maybe i need to do that to unlock base progress cam
00:46:53 <skram> Good luck with that :P
00:47:28 <skram> I got the newest Dynatron record and its probably my favorite these days
00:47:36 <Cane> I've also been listening to a lot of Vangelis and Jean Michel Jarre again lately. Big nostalgic kick for me.
00:47:40 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE9jShG9sD0 is good background noise.
00:47:58 <Cane> Now that's classic ambient electronic goodness.
00:48:00 <skram> oxygene is brilliant
00:48:04 <Cane> It's so good.
00:48:18 <Cane> You're a man of discerning taste, skram. <3
00:48:33 <skram> I saw a rundown of his live rig, he's got SO MANY things
00:48:57 <Cane> I have a recording of his epic Paris 1995 concert where he smashed the Guinness world record for most live attendees for a concert.
00:49:04 <Cane> Which he smashed again, in Moscow, with something like 3 million people.
00:49:08 <Cane> His light shows are incredible.
00:49:08 <skram> awesome
00:49:44 <skram> I regret not going to his show in oslo a few years back
00:49:56 <Cane> I know. I wasn't able to go either. Small venue though.
00:50:07 <Cane> iirc
00:50:28 <skram> it was spektrum i think
00:50:33 <skram> which admittedly isnt that big
00:50:35 <Cane> Yeah.
00:50:50 <Cane> So you won't get that epic light show you want from a JMJ concert, just the intimate music.
00:50:59 <Cane> Still sad I couldn't go though.
00:51:04 <Camail> skram  seriously, try destroying your duplicate base at my base
00:51:18 <Camail> maybe it tihnks you arleady have the guy and its messing up
00:51:18 <Cane> destroy his base in ur base?
00:51:24 <Cane> The fuck game is this.
00:51:31 <skram> :D
00:51:36 <Camail> the kind of game that skram is losing, apparently
00:51:44 <skram> rude
00:51:45 <Cane> Gotta narrow it down buddy
00:52:35 <skram> honestly the best venues in oslo at least is the smaller ones Cane
00:52:44 <skram> spektrum is pretty meh and telenor arena is worthless
00:53:13 <Cane> Jarre has done some amazing concerts.
00:53:19 <Cane> Not just the record smashing ones in France and Russia
00:53:39 <Cane> But the themed ones, like the one where he rang in the new millennium, and the one where he played during a total eclipse.
00:53:39 <skram> dude's legendary
00:53:42 <Cane> Mmhmm.
00:54:04 <Cane> Everybody knows Vangelis from That One Movie Everyone Can Hum The Song From. Jarre not so much, but he was always my favorite.
00:54:18 <Cane> Shame he got old and weird.
00:54:45 <skram> hahah
00:54:53 <Cane> He stopped doing ambient, warm, electronic stuff and really fun synthpop in favor of some odd experimental sex moaning album thing with his wife.
00:55:07 <Cane> I think that's roughly when I stopped paying attention lol
00:55:09 <skram> i havent even looked at the new stuff
00:55:22 <Cane> Yeah not for a long time.
00:55:31 <Cane> Only recent song worth a damn is Vintage. Probably named because it's the closest to his old stuff.
00:56:14 <Cane> But Oxygene is a masterpiece, Equinoxe is fantastic, Chronologie is superb.
00:56:28 <Cane> Good music for several decades.
00:56:31 <skram> yes, yes, and also yes
00:57:46 <skram> if you like neat ambient pieces you should probably check out nils frahm and olafur arnalds
00:58:33 <Cane> They sound foreigny.
00:59:10 <Cane> Oh, and Rendez-Vous is epic. Second Rendez-Vous played with a real orchestra is just huge.
00:59:13 <skram> german and icelandic
00:59:36 <Cane> And Fourth is just fun and cute synthpop to vary things up a bit.
01:00:10 <Cane> skram, do you remember the one Norwegian radio show that used Jarre's "Calypso Part 1" as their "waiting" music?
01:00:20 <Cane> Quiz show thing.
01:00:39 <Cane> Once I got into Jarre I remember going "THAT'S THE MUSIC FROM THE THING"
01:00:48 <skram> haha
01:01:01 <skram> no, i never really listened to radio
01:01:24 <Cane> Same, but my dad listened to that one every day, so it's one of those things I just grew up with. =)
01:01:28 <skram> i had a record player and two milk crates of dad rock, abba, adnd supertramp
01:01:33 <Cane> Hahahaha
01:01:41 <Cane> How did you survive with your tastes intact?
01:02:57 <skram> Are you trying to tell me that ABBA's Waterloo, winner of the 1974 ESC is not the greatest piece of music written?
01:04:52 <Cane> AND THE PORSCHE 917 IS A MUNTED LOOKING BLOB SKRAM
01:04:56 <Cane> ALL THE THINGS YOU LIKE ARE WRONG
01:05:22 <skram> ouf
01:05:30 <skram> you're hurting my feelings cane :p

01:05:39 <Cane> Hai DuB`. <3
01:07:36 <Cane> skram, I started listening to Oxygene again as soon as I linked it. Part 4 just started and all I have in my head are penguins.
01:07:43 <Cane> This was the penguin song for the longest time.
01:08:19 <skram> hahah
01:09:03 <skram> i cant remember where this is from
01:11:09 <DuB`> Hallu
01:11:17 <skram> Hey buddy
01:11:39 <Cane> Hah the music video for Oxygene 4 is just footage of penguins being endearing.
01:14:06 <DuB`> While this song is great, skram, I'm afraid you have confused me
01:14:17 <DuB`> De Press - Oslo
01:15:35 <skram> whats the confusing part my dear
01:19:30 <DuB`> You said "tired of bleeps and bloops"
01:19:32 <DuB`> How can this be

01:34:12 <skram> what
01:34:14 <skram> how did that happen
01:34:19 <skram> what did you DO
01:34:30 <DvB`> I know people
01:34:33 <DvB`> Space people
01:34:40 <skram> pls introduce me
01:34:52 <DvB`> (Just refresh freighter bridge missions)
01:35:28 <DvB`> There are some destroy depot, infiltrate place, defend freighter, and kill walker missions that give rewards worth 2-5m
01:35:50 <skram> i need to buy a new space boat
01:36:09 <DvB`> I have a S Class Exotic fighter that has godly stats but only 17 slots :T
01:36:20 <DvB`> Was only 7m
01:37:01 <skram> thats a lot of moni
01:49:33 <Camail> dub i found an a class multi tool with 24 slots
01:49:41 <Camail> i think that's gonna be the last one i buy
01:50:00 <Camail> honestly 24 slots is more than you need
01:50:21 <Camail> the more tools you put on the more annoying it is to cycle through them
01:50:56 <Camail> and yea, some of the missions have pretty big rewards

02:26:27 <Camail> you should be asleep!
02:30:38 <skram> of course not
02:57:56 <Cane> I should probably stop bitching about the heat, but I'm not giong to. It's too hot and too humid and Norway should not be enduring country-wide heat records for a month straight.
02:58:16 <skram> there was a rain today down here
02:58:18 <Cane> If I move any further north the trees start disappearing.
02:58:42 <skram> you should go to one of those greek party islands to cool down
02:58:56 <Cane> We had a torrential downpour that lasted ~15 minutes here. I thought maybe it'd ease up a bit but it's still so humid. Feels like I'm breathing the same air as I did in early July.
