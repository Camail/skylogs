00:09:50 <DuB`> I exercised
00:09:57 <DuB`> I EARNED thiis big cheesecake brownie! >:D
00:15:21 <Camail> dub have you beaten poe1 yet
00:15:26 <DuB`> Nu
00:15:32 <DuB`> Close to end of vanilla, I think
00:15:52 <Camail> what city are youn in/going to
00:16:48 <DuB`> Doin' all the twin elms stuff
00:18:08 <Camail> so you're like level 12 now?
00:18:19 <DuB`> Almost 11
00:19:41 <Camail> since you have the dlc i think it goes to 14 now
00:27:10 <Phearlock_> Poe2 is so fun.
00:27:19 <Camail> indeed
00:28:04 <Phearlock_> I kinda wish I'd enabled upward scaling now though. Lotta stuff I ahven't done yet that's now trivially easy.
00:28:29 <Camail> i did, and honestly it's not super different
00:28:59 <Camail> unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty it's an easy game
00:29:18 <Phearlock_> Yeah even stuff 1-2 levels higher than me hasn't been much of an issue when I've attempted it.
00:29:41 <Phearlock_> Been mucho funtimes though. Just beat up Nemnok =P
00:30:22 <Camail> yea that was great
00:30:40 <Camail> so did you do the arkemyr quests?
00:31:10 <Phearlock_> Not yet, just have the one to check out taht observatory
00:31:42 <Camail> it's pretty juicy
00:32:16 <Phearlock_> I shall head there soonish =P
00:33:35 <Camail> i do kinda wish the game was a little less open and put more of that time into the critical path
00:33:53 <Camail> in a general design comment, a ton of games seem to be going wide rather than going deep
00:34:20 <Camail> it's...troubling to me. but it's more engaging for more people so i understand
00:35:30 <Phearlock_> As long as enough of the open stuff feels nontrivial to the world I don't mind it. But I agree it's an issue sometimes.
01:15:28 <Camail> nooooooo slay the spire devs nerfed seek
01:15:29 <Camail> nooooooo
01:15:40 <Camail> I'm so sad
01:15:46 <Camail> it was the best card in the game

03:49:54 <Camail> Seek is still a good card, but it NEEDS to be upgrades to get my favorite utility, which is turbo+meteor
03:50:06 <Camail> still can't win a normal run with the defect...

23:05:29 <skram> stage*
23:06:31 <Crisium> they went 10-0
23:06:48 <skram> thats great
23:13:33 <Zounds> Did they end up with the Hanzo changes or not
23:13:46 <Crisium> nope
23:13:57 <Crisium> old hanzo, old lucio, no nerfs to skillrat genji tracer
23:14:24 <Zounds> That's a bit strange
23:14:38 <Bio> yeah, strange they aren't on live for the start of this stage
23:15:02 <Crisium> theres a bug
23:15:07 <Crisium> cant take changes for OWL
23:15:12 <Zounds> Well he did just mention the dps choice being flexible
23:15:18 <Zounds> So maybe it's for the best with no new hanzo
23:15:20 <Zounds> haha
23:18:13 <Crisium> yeah honestly this is a better patch
23:18:19 <Crisium> more DPS variety with OP Hanzo
23:25:15 <Crisium> Ana!
23:29:28 <DuB`> Woooo!
23:29:35 <DuB`> Sooolid
23:30:16 <Crisium> Fissure best rein
23:32:03 <DuB`> DPS player as zarya and offtank on brighetti is interesting
23:32:11 <DuB`> Makes sense though
23:35:14 <Runbunny> Dubbu Dubbu.
