19:18:33 <DoT|Phone> hey pear
19:19:29 <Phearlock> hey hey hey
19:20:48 <Camail> Phearlock  it was wild going back to act 1 and actually knowing how to play them game
19:21:01 <Camail> i spent hours on the alexander fight in my first playthrough
19:21:33 <Camail> took maybe 10 minutes? i almost feel like you lose a lot fo the game if you dont play in tactician mode
19:24:44 <Phearlock> Honestly, I didn't find too much of a difference between tactician and classic.
19:25:40 <Phearlock> Then again. I did do tactician right after I finished classic and did a lot of refinement.
19:26:10 <Phearlock> So that they ended up feeling the same in difficulty is probably just that I still had everything fresh
19:30:06 <Phearlock> I got distracted from this playthrough though so if stuff is radically different in act 3 no spoils xD
19:30:13 <Phearlock> Cause I won't get there for a while

21:24:12 <Zounds> Well i'm doing heroic on sunday, prob gonna try and pug a normal or something between then and now
21:24:26 <skrm> My friends and I dont really have a big guild or anything so everyone sorta just shows up
21:24:46 <Zounds> yeh me neither I just play with friends
21:24:49 <skrm> And there were 30 of us which surprised me bunch
21:24:53 <Zounds> most of whom aren't even in my guild
21:25:49 <skrm> Was good fun though, everything was still new and we had to learn as we went along
21:26:01 <Zounds> \o/
21:26:42 <Zounds> I did a few mythic+
21:28:01 <Zounds> +4 freehold was comfy enough with an almost freshly dinged hunter
21:28:35 <skrm> Yeah m+ is alright too but its just more of the same, really
21:28:46 <Zounds> I like it because it's always there
21:28:47 <skrm> did +4 temple and it was stressful as heck as a healer
21:29:35 <Zounds> Yeah I would imagine sethrallis would be tougher
21:29:50 <Zounds> do the respawning little guys drop sanguine pools when they die? :P
21:35:45 <skrm> thankfully
21:36:00 <skrm> not
21:37:17 <skrm> bosses are easy but trash pakcs are friggin brutal
