22:03:43 <Camail> but shrowd man...shrowd is nuts
22:04:13 <Camail> i really think sword might be the optimal choice
22:04:28 <Camail> skram  also they are looking at chainblade dash iframes
22:04:37 <Camail> because they're so shitty
22:05:05 <skram> fuckin excellent
22:11:40 <Dot> are they fixing spear though?
22:13:01 <Camail> spear isnt as broken as cb dash
22:15:37 <Camail> CR is streaming more nothing
22:15:46 <Camail> but with the kick started page too
22:15:57 <Camail> they've got 500k usd for their minis so far
