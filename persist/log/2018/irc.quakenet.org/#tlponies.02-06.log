10:03:09 <Cane> We're still alive, I just had to stop because I'd been at it for so long.
10:03:44 <Cane> .tell skram You're still alive. I had to send you into a room full of radiation and you almost died and it was pointless, but other than that everything went great.
10:03:51 <Cane> Hmm.

10:06:00 <Dot`> Raswr rawr rawr

20:58:02 <Phearlock> The stream always crashes when the thing lands, whether it blows up or not.
20:58:21 <Phearlock> Sometimes it comes back, sometimes it doesn't
