09:19:42 <Dot> dont do that skram
09:19:44 <Dot> its the weekend
09:28:00 <Dot> skrm https://imgur.com/gallery/OEaRm8X
09:30:08 <skrm> :D
09:30:13 <skrm> I dont have a choice, dot
09:46:38 <Dot> look skrm https://imgur.com/gallery/YZ8Ehlx

11:01:57 <skrm> those are some weird dogs Dot 
11:08:15 <Dot> skram, i found a martial art to use next time i make a dnd monk, Bartitsu, basicly ecentric english gentlemen self defence form about 1901
11:08:51 <Dot> a mix of stick(can e) fighting, boxing, jujitsu and one or 2 other martial arts
11:13:36 <skrm> Is your next character gonna be some sort of victorian toff
11:14:38 <Dot> who knows!
11:15:46 <Dot> but the main thing i never liked about monks was the whole monastic thing
11:18:14 <skrm> its in the name, dot
11:18:23 <skrm> monks come from monestaries
11:18:58 <Dot> dont you pidgeonhole monks skram
11:19:48 <Dot> and i would like to metion barbarians, aka savages from tribes
11:19:55 <Dot> mister noble dwarf
11:21:20 <skrm> engelbert is savage af, dot
11:21:54 <Dot> with a top hat
11:22:55 <skrm> is that jealousy i hear
11:23:26 <Dot> otus has no need for a top hat, he is happy with his hight
11:26:59 <skrm> engelbert is not compensating dot
11:27:01 <skrm> not at all
11:32:27 <Dot> the rage is definatly not a coping mechanism
11:32:52 <skrm> preposterous
11:41:00 <Dot> might manage to get your parcels off today skram
11:41:44 <Dot> went last week all ready to send and it came to 2.2 kg, which apparently is over 2 kg so royal mail cant take
11:42:03 <Dot> meant going by parcel force at 40 pounds!
11:42:10 <Dot> so split them up now to 2 packages
11:42:17 <Dot> should be around 10 pounds each to send
11:43:18 <skrm> hmm
11:43:29 <skrm> i should send you some socks for christmas then
11:43:51 <skrm> or a gift card at your favorite IKEA store??
11:43:53 <skrm> think about it
11:43:57 <skrm> SEASONAL CURTAINS
11:56:10 <Dot> i need thick red curtains to complete my plan
11:59:08 <Dot> hmm, maybe more burgandy
12:03:54 <Dot> obviosly in the case of socks they need to be diffrent colours
12:16:23 <skrm> of course
12:16:31 <skrm> straw for easter
12:17:04 <Dot> 1 pair of socks skram, each one a diffrent colour
12:17:17 <Dot> im an adult meaning i dont wear maching sicks
12:17:20 <Dot> socks

12:19:53 <skrm> helps that all my socks are black

22:23:30 <DuB`> Phearlock halp
22:23:45 <Phearlock> what's up dub?
22:23:51 <DuB`> Playing starsector and I thought I was supposed to be able to buy ships when my standing was good
22:24:15 <DuB`> But my hedgemoney standing is maxed and I still see no option to get ships at mil stations?
22:24:28 <Phearlock> Oh to get access to military market high end shit you need to talk to a planet admin and ask for a comission
22:24:32 <DuB`> I did
22:24:35 <DuB`> Long ago
22:24:59 <Phearlock> And you're at like jangala or something and click their military market tab at the top there where you can buy ships?
22:25:04 <DuB`> Game also won't give me the option to recover enemy ships anymore, so my fleet is kinda just getting whittled down to nothing
22:25:20 <DuB`> There are no ships in any military market that I've seen in the last 6 hours
22:25:26 <Phearlock> That's...
22:25:30 <Phearlock> I have never seen that bug before
22:25:31 <Phearlock> haha
22:26:00 <DuB`> zzz
22:26:04 <Phearlock> http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?board=4.0
22:26:48 <Phearlock> Also can try reinstalling the game, there's like 3 hotfixes out now since yesterday
22:27:06 <Phearlock> Patch day is a bit silly.
22:27:22 <DuB`> Keep save games?
22:27:26 <Phearlock> yes
22:27:47 <Phearlock> It won't delete mods or savegames so you'll have to delete those yourself.
22:27:56 <Phearlock> uh, if you want
22:28:04 <Phearlock> Oh and markets usually update about once every 30 days
22:28:27 <Phearlock> so even if it magically fixes itself it'll probably take that long to refresh
22:35:17 <DuB`> I finally got my first cruiser and was so excited and then.... nothing at all for so many hours, and my fleet was getting too weak to actually fight anything
22:35:33 <Phearlock> That is really strange
