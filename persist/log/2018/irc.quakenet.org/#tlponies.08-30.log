22:21:31 <Camail> limiting strafing would have an impact, but i dont know how much, it seems like a pretty subtle change. the biggest decision is whether you want flanking at all
22:22:00 <Camail> giving advantage for flanking has always seemed intense, but then again often times when you flank an enemy it leaves you open to be flanked
22:22:08 <Camail> almost like activating reckless attacks
22:24:18 <DoT`> the 5ft move to me seemed to turn it more into a dedicated decision and more tacticly challanging to achieve

22:24:39 <DoT`> but all it may do is cause frustration and slow combat
22:24:51 <DoT`> as i agree the advantage is a big thing
22:25:02 <Camail> its only gonna be 5 or 10 feet of an inconvenience, or you just dont do it
22:25:10 <Camail> which, in our intitial party, we probably wont
22:25:14 <Camail> because i'm a proteciton fighter
22:25:23 <skram> 5e combat is fine
22:25:33 <Camail> it wont come into play with our team comp
22:26:18 <Camail> i have protection and then special movement options to let my team move/disengage for free
22:27:44 <Camail> in the end i think normal flanking is fine
22:28:01 <Camail> i think making a bunch of small changes to icnrease difficulty is eventually going to be a concern
22:28:21 <Camail> as it's difficult to see the accumulated effect
22:28:40 <Camail> unless we actually play
22:29:35 <DoT`> yea, i definatly dont tihnk i will implement any changes first session, i need to run a game to get the timing right again
22:29:59 <DoT`> also in sometihng like LMoP i could count on at least an hour of ppl messing around in town for no reason
22:30:41 <skram> its called roleplaying, dad
22:30:51 <Camail> i can waste as much or as little time as you want, but honestly it's a good idea to learn something about the town before we immediately run off
22:31:47 <DoT`> skram pls, you ppl always found random things to do that i could just scratch an hour when plannign how far you would get
22:32:03 <Camail> it always feels good to plan for a session that turns into 2 or 3
22:32:18 <skram> thats the best part of dnd dot
22:32:21 <skram> fuck your campaign
22:32:29 <skram> i want a cool fuckin hat
22:32:32 <Camail> i swear i'll start making my world one day. stars are always getting closer to alignment
22:32:45 <Camail> skram why do you want so much clothing
22:32:45 <DoT`> the tricky thing is once there are more ppl sessions are deisgned to only last a session
22:32:54 <Camail> bardum invented the tuxedo ffs
22:33:06 <DoT`> and i want to see if i can work on that kind of timing, its an intresting challange
22:33:22 <skram> its important to look dapper while killing orcs cam
22:33:32 <Camail> you gets torn and bloody
22:34:00 <skram> even better
22:44:10 <Camail> skram wanna try and finish those heroics? if no one joins we can just like...not do it
22:52:38 <skram> nah
22:52:53 <skram> i dont have fun in monster hunter jr
22:57:13 <Camail> i dont like how they do health
22:57:21 <Camail> also it doest help that you dont like any of the weapons
22:57:37 <skram> i'd punch them with my fists if i could
23:00:49 <Runbunny> You sound like a true warhorn player Skram.
23:01:22 <Camail> he'd probably play dual blades
23:13:40 <DoT`> it would be nice if just once i spelt sword without first typing swaord
23:18:35 <reification> gâ€™night all
23:19:15 <DoT`> gnight reif 
23:52:33 <Phearlock_> Ok finished that dnd character... Wait that's not a druid. Dot do you mind that I swapped classes at the last minute? xD
23:52:59 <skram> but ferlok its your turn to be the barbarian
23:53:06 <Phearlock_> No I sneek
23:53:19 <skram> barbs can sneek
23:53:32 <skram> trust me
23:53:36 <skram> i am the master of sneeks
23:53:40 <DoT`> you didnt go ranger, so te swap is fine
23:53:45 <Phearlock_> Sweet.
23:54:07 <Phearlock_> My rogue is a former noble trying to get as far away from his past life as possible.
23:54:18 <DoT`> well you cant get further
23:54:21 <Phearlock_> Great reason to out in the middle of nowhere
23:54:26 <Phearlock_> to be*
23:55:10 <Phearlock_> Stats were average as fuck and I got a 7, so I'm not very wise apparently.
23:55:30 <DoT`> what you roll?
23:55:42 <skram> my character is pretty unremarkable stat-wise too
23:55:54 <Phearlock_> 12,17,13,7,11 (not in that order, but that's the order I distributed the)
23:56:12 <Phearlock_> Grabbed vanilla human so +1 to all
23:56:59 <DoT`> my brain refuses to recall how to add points
23:57:30 <DoT`> the roll looks above average, but im not usre becuase that 7 is low
23:57:30 <Phearlock_> oh the sheet did it for me
23:57:49 <Phearlock_> not the rolls that is
23:58:05 <Phearlock_> but adding +1 to everything
23:58:20 <DoT`> if its too low you can reroll, but i cant recall how to count points atm
23:58:29 <DoT`> but with +1 to all hose become nice stats
23:58:42 <Phearlock_> yeah
