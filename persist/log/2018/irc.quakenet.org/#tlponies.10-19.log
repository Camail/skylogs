20:36:30 <Camail> i personally dont believe Naps need to be defined by Length at all, much less the Wakes that are interspersed

21:20:52 <Crisium> beo
21:20:52 <Bio> from the work
21:20:53 <skram> but i cant make any corpses because i cant do damage without a corpse

21:31:53 <Bio> yus!
21:32:44 <skram> im not doing the mage thing because i dont have the set yet cam
21:33:04 <skram> im doing the icyveins guide to corpse lance build
21:33:33 <skram> looks like the thing to do is run away until you find something worth fighting and use your 120 second cooldown to make corpses
21:38:36 <Camail> i just did bounty farming and got my set through opening caches on my monk
21:38:53 <Camail> you could try that if the necro build is too slow to get into on its own
21:39:14 <skram> yeh
21:40:33 <Camail> all you need are 7 pieces of your set to really start making your damage high tier
21:40:46 <Camail> 6 pieces to wear and the 7th to convert over and over to get free re-rolls
21:52:25 <skram> .tell dub` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFH7IdYwjlI

21:53:05 <skram> did anyone else sign up for generation zero beta?
21:53:48 <skram> its like dayz except you're in sweden and instead of zombies there are robots
22:12:32 <Camail> looks interesting, but i'm not into doing betas anymore
22:15:44 <Runbunny> Camail is all about being handled by an alpha now. 
22:16:00 <Camail> alphas are even worse
22:16:06 <Camail> i want ur full retail bb
22:21:31 <skram> theres no sound
22:21:41 <skram> is it because its beta or is it because my computer is stupid
22:21:56 <Runbunny> Yes.
