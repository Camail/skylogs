21:42:43 <Phearlock__> Well it's not fancy cause I felt like building something out of wood for once.
21:42:58 <Phearlock__> And not like an armored-shielded-hovercraft
21:43:21 <skram> neat
21:43:49 <Phearlock__> Hopefully
21:44:17 <skram> what sort of boat is it
21:44:27 <Phearlock__> I don't know how to classify boats.
21:44:50 <Phearlock__> It's like 1 main hull with 2 big outriggers where I'll put more guns and some more ammo =P
21:44:55 <skram> well theres the ones that go bang bang then theres the ones that go wooooosh and then theres the one with plane babbys
21:45:15 <Phearlock__> Oh, its a bang boat
21:45:31 <skram> cool beans
21:45:48 <CockRoach|42> Zounds hors
21:45:50 <BioSC> dont forget about the stealthy boi 
21:46:11 <BioSC> U N D E R W A T E R B O A T S
21:46:13 <skram> right
21:46:17 <skram> the swimmy lad
21:46:48 <Phearlock__> I put the whale detectors on it
21:47:08 <Phearlock__> Though guns don't shoot subs very well. Hm.
21:47:22 <Phearlock__> Eh there's plenty of room for an underslung torpedo turret as well.
21:47:29 <Phearlock__> adding it to the list
21:50:50 <skram> i dont know if underslung is the right word if its on a boat though
21:51:20 <Phearlock__> Keel mounted? It's going on the bottom of the boat
22:04:11 <DuB`> Anyone else oberwaj?
22:04:14 <Camail> lets all get on the bang boat
