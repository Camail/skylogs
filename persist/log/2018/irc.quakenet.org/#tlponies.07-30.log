01:13:38 <Camail> skram sorry i was afk
01:13:43 <Camail> watched incredibles 2
01:13:53 <Camail> hope you enjoyed space today
01:14:44 <Camail> also, make runbunny your maid
01:14:48 <Camail> i think he's into that
01:15:04 <Camail> he probably has a french maid outfit, just in case
01:16:10 <Camail> this medication is so much better than being drunk, it's like being buzzed for 12 hours
01:16:26 <skram> i dont want to be senpai, cam
01:16:36 <Camail> hmmm
01:16:44 <Camail> well, he wants a kohai
01:16:52 <Camail> so you can be the \little spoon
01:17:02 <skram> i dont know what that is
01:17:15 <Camail> it's the other person in that relationship
01:17:19 <Camail> senpai and kohai
01:17:23 <Camail> mentor and pupil
01:17:32 <Camail> elder and bitch
01:17:45 <skram> runbunny is too soft to be senpai i think
01:18:10 <Camail> he's hard when you need it
01:20:48 <skram> i guess
01:20:55 <skram> the times ive needed that is 0 so far
01:20:57 <skram> so good job
01:21:02 <Camail> .tell runbunny we need you to put on your french maid clothes and clean skram's stuff
01:21:13 <skram> ""stuff""
01:21:23 <Camail> yes, all of it
01:21:28 <Camail> hand jobs are extra, obv
01:21:59 <Camail> did you see my base name
01:22:02 <skram> i always prefer the happy ending after someones done my dishes
01:22:04 <skram> i did not
01:22:19 <Camail> my planet gets up to 600f
01:22:28 <Camail> 315c
01:23:11 <skram> is it congruent with the butt naming convention we set up
01:25:00 <Camail> no
01:25:05 <Camail> but it can be
01:25:53 <Camail> ok, now it is
01:26:09 <skram> BLAZING BUTTCHEEKS
01:26:40 <skram> also theres a profanity filter on base nmames
01:26:48 <skram> so i couldnt name mine fuckbois central
01:27:01 <Camail> fuccbois could work
01:27:04 <Camail> maybe that's dubs
01:27:05 <skram> maybe
01:27:09 <skram> wel obvs
01:27:23 <Camail> also we can do missions together, we should try that next time
01:27:36 <Camail> cuz i think missions are a party-wide thing
01:27:39 <skram> missions?
01:27:49 <Camail> yea, from the people on space stations or on freighters
01:27:55 <skram> oh right
01:27:56 <Camail> specifically the ones form the freighters
01:28:06 <skram> i sent my unrepairable frigate on a mission
01:28:07 <skram> it died
01:35:56 <Camail> rip
01:36:07 <Camail> my missions started not dying, it's great
01:36:20 <Camail> still dont really do them because it's an afterthought
01:36:36 <Camail> also i dont have enough money to buy a lot of frigates
01:37:07 <Camail> my ship looks cool tho, all the fighter types look like classic star ships
01:37:37 <skram> i dont think i have enough cash for a cool lookin ship
01:37:52 <skram> pretty silly that my exosuit has more room than a friggin spaceship though
01:41:15 <Camail> well i didnt buy this one, i found it and repaired it
01:41:38 <Camail> the only thing you NEED to fix is the top row of parts, then you can slowly repair each broken slot
01:41:52 <Camail> its real easy to get chromium if you have activated iridium
01:42:09 <skram> i think you're further along than me
01:42:27 <Camail> maybe in certain areas because i kinda know where to look
01:42:50 <Camail> but finding a broken ship is a random event, and if you search for distress calls you can find them
01:43:32 <skram> i've been looking for ancient ruin stuff
01:43:36 <Camail> also i got some S tier movement mods, you should do that
01:43:43 <Camail> they are really nice to have
01:43:48 <skram> sometimes you find artifacts that are worth a shit ton
01:43:55 <skram> yeah i have it
01:43:58 <skram> jetpack for dayz
01:44:19 <Camail> turns out you can actually mess up and isntall too many mods and it shuts down your suit
01:44:28 <skram> D:
01:44:29 <Camail> if you chain more than 5, i think
01:45:10 <Camail> but yea in terms of quests your ahead of me
01:45:24 <Camail> i just happened to get this ship and it was good
01:45:32 <Camail> its still B tier tho
01:46:07 <skram> i spent some time looking for a winter planet actually
01:46:25 <skram> did like 8 jumps and couldnt find any
01:46:51 <Camail> hmmm, thats unfortunate
01:47:06 <Camail> i also lucked out and got a hot planet in a blue system, which is what i wanted
01:47:10 <Camail> its....really hot tho
01:47:33 <Camail> could planets are cool, i need to visit them to get mats for glass
01:47:46 <skram> Eh, since you have teleports and stuff I just picked a nice planet with little extreme weather
01:48:23 <skram> figured once i expand a bit ill just place base things on planets i harvest from
01:49:17 <Camail> how many bases can you have
01:49:52 <skram> no idea
01:50:48 <Camail> oh also oxygen + silver = paraffinium
01:51:03 <Camail> which is important because you use that to repair some ship stuff
01:51:16 <skram> right
01:51:25 <Camail> that, cromatic metals, and chlorine are most of what goes into a broken ship
01:51:28 <skram> paraffinium is pretty abundant anyway
01:51:40 <Camail> yea but i dont want to warp just to go get it, i have money to spend
01:51:48 <skram> rich boi
01:52:06 <Camail> i was up to 10 mil, but after ship repairs i am down to 7
01:52:32 <Camail> raiding freighters, stealing eggs, lottsa money in that
01:52:46 <Camail> every abandon base has like 2-3mil waiting for you
01:52:59 <Camail> and our dome method makes it safe
01:53:56 <skram> well true
01:54:12 <skram> its just very silly
01:59:38 <Camail> yea, but it makes sense in a certain way
01:59:51 <Camail> these are dumb animals and we have the total advantage of preparation
02:00:08 <Camail> we stack the deck heavily in our favor and ignore nature's advantage, like in the real world
02:00:13 <skram> hmm
02:00:16 <skram> fair enough
02:00:30 <skram> is that how ancient man hunted mammoths? using poo iglos?
02:03:33 <Camail> i mean....there are some common elements

03:42:09 <Camail> there's a mod that adds support class thing, like bard instruments that buff teammates, that one looked interesting as well
03:42:53 <Bio> yeah, thats thorium
