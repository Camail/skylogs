22:31:45 <Crisium> lots of social changes too
22:31:53 <Crisium> and attack+defense is removed
22:31:57 <Crisium> now "damage" category
22:32:16 <Crisium> since half the defense heroes were better on attack anyway
22:33:28 <Crisium> or, "offense" it was called
22:34:18 <Crisium> wow, level 3 sym damage :O

23:24:44 <Camail> salad cream sounds disgusting
23:25:04 <Dot> is it not just mayo? ive never had it
23:25:36 <Dot> but this article is front page bbc, i enjoy seeing what IMPORTANT events show up there
23:25:56 <Camail> it probably is
23:26:06 <Camail> tho i would never think to add mayo to increase flavor variety
23:26:33 <Camail> it's just there to be a fatty foundation for other flavors
23:36:16 <skram> Dot
23:36:33 <Dot> where you go
23:36:39 <skram> outside
23:36:41 <skram> then inside
23:37:20 <Dot> are you a serrial killer? your always going out at night
23:38:01 <skram> maybe im out doing drugs
23:38:26 <Dot> your too respectable for that
23:38:41 <skram> haha
