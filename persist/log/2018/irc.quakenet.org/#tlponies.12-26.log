02:20:30 <DuB`> Yes
02:20:32 <DuB`> Perfect
02:20:35 <Camail> DuB`  i got dot the rest of the division
02:20:37 <DuB`> Time for choco pie
02:20:44 <Camail> so we can go back in
02:26:03 <DuB`> Coo
02:28:02 <DuB`> 14 hours in EU4 in 2 days, ha
02:29:12 <Crisium> wait you play EU4 dub?
02:30:05 <DuB`> Got it this week on sale
02:30:15 <Crisium> i have 526 hours
02:30:40 <DuB`> :D
02:30:40 <Crisium> barely played it this year tho
02:31:05 <Crisium> it's one of those games were the minutes become the hours very quickly
02:31:25 <Crisium> who did you try to play?
02:31:52 <DuB`> Did a bunch of Spain to learn things
02:32:04 <Crisium> good idea
02:32:19 <DuB`> Then made a custom country in NA to see if I could fight of colonialism for fun
02:32:24 <DuB`> off*
02:32:33 <DuB`> It's going... okay :P
02:32:43 <Crisium> haha, custom nations can be fun
02:34:07 <DuB`> Spain and England can't push me aside but they're kinda taking everything else they want
02:34:13 <Crisium> I like to make historical curiosities like a Jewish Israel still alive in 1444 for some reason, or a Prester John nation in the middle of non-Christian lands, or do something like a Nordic Vinland in Scandinavia
02:34:14 <DuB`> Gonna try to start fighting them in earnest soon
02:34:31 <Crisium> i mean Norse* Vinland
02:34:31 <DuB`> Nice nice
02:35:12 <skrm> what does that mean cris
02:35:21 <Crisium> Viking gods
02:35:27 <Crisium> Odin
02:35:28 <Crisium> etc
02:35:44 <Crisium> they get special bonuses for that religion
02:36:25 <Crisium> it can be fun to make custom nations and let the AI play them and just see WTF happens
02:36:39 <DuB`> Ya
02:37:00 <DuB`> I'm tempted constantly just to start a game and fast-forward through as observer to watch alternative history unfold :D
02:37:01 <Crisium> the EZ modes of the game are Poland, France, Ottomans, Austria
02:37:12 <Crisium> or Muscovy
02:37:39 <skrm> whats a nordic vinland
02:37:43 <Crisium> Castille pretty easy too but the AI sometimes loses to Aragorn so who knows
02:38:33 <Crisium> i corrected myself in the next posting skrm, to norse vinland
02:39:29 <Crisium> basically give norse religion norwegians northeast Canada, Greenland, Iceland.  or just have them take over Scandinavia
02:40:09 <skrm> ah
02:40:11 <skrm> the dream

02:40:46 <Crisium> the EU4 devs are Swedish tho, so unfortunately Norway is one of the hardest nations to play as Sweden is OP
02:41:25 <skrm> friggin sweden strikes again

02:41:29 <skrm> fuck those guys
02:41:36 <BioPhone> Henlo
02:41:42 <Crisium> its like 60:39 whether Sweden or Denmark wins.  with a 1% chance Norway wins (literally have seen it once or twice ever)
02:41:50 <BioPhone> I'm alright with those silly sweedes
02:41:57 <skrm> no you're not
02:42:27 <DuB`> Pick Norway and console command those sweeds into oblivion
02:42:37 <Crisium> the true path to success
02:47:33 <BioPhone> Oh

03:13:39 <DuB`> How much deeper does it even go?? :P
03:18:11 <skrm> there's 8x?
03:18:35 <BioPhone> 16x imo
03:19:30 <DuB`> explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate... and expropriate, exhibit, express, and experiment.
03:21:54 <skrm> perfect
03:21:55 <Camail> excommunicate, too
03:22:21 <skrm> dont excommunicate your vassals camail, how else will you get their tribute
03:22:37 <DuB`> "Just google 'list of words that start with ex-'; you can do all those things in our game."
03:22:44 <Camail> other countries can have your religion, then threaten them if they get too uppity
03:23:11 <Camail> it was used as a political tool all the time pre-luther

16:54:57 <Runbunny> The world variant?
16:55:04 <Zounds> Was quite decent, reminded me of gigantic a bit
16:55:44 <Zounds> Or if Overwatch and Smite had a baby
16:58:17 <Runbunny> This owl guy has a pretty good review of it Zounds. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MciMuVUmrQM
16:58:34 <Runbunny> Even talk about how Gigantic was the better game all along.

16:59:47 <Zounds> I'll have to check that out :P

17:38:34 <DuB`> I'mma have to get myself one eventually
17:38:57 <Camail> its not my kinda thing cuz i like freedom, but if you want a bed hug it's nice
17:41:02 <Runbunny> Fucking around in the "training" area is pretty neat.
17:45:47 <Camail> yea, i tried for a bit
17:45:59 <Camail> glaive is weird, clunkier than i thought it would be
17:48:16 <Camail> i dunno if i can even do anything today, internet is hella unstable
17:48:28 <Camail> every 10 minutes or so its hiccuping 
17:48:35 <Camail> dub stop stealing my internet

17:50:14 <DuB`> I need more tubes
17:50:28 <Runbunny> Do you know the attack string?
17:50:44 <Runbunny> there are also some attacks that can be rolled out of.
17:50:55 <Runbunny> and having the red buff is really needed.
17:51:34 <Runbunny> However the starting kinsects are super slow and bothersome to hit with.
