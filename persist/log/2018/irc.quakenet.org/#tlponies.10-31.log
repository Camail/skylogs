19:10:49 <carcinization> seems appropriate that fallout76 has a bug where it nukes itself :D
19:18:42 <Dot> its not a bug its a feature
19:43:31 <skram> dot pal
19:44:00 <Dot> Skram friend
19:44:32 <skram> whats up with your face today

19:45:58 <Dot> have a traning course the next 2 days
19:46:04 <Dot> the standard one so i can go to sites
19:46:10 <Dot> probably very boring

19:49:34 <Dot> nope
19:49:39 <Dot> but work will buy it when i do
19:52:45 <skram> what color
19:54:20 <Dot> probably white
20:01:01 <skram> well you're the newbie so yours will probably be pink
20:01:10 <skram> or is hazing not a thing in englando
20:01:47 <Dot> i have yet to be hazed, but this friday we are going out to mini golf as a team, so will see what happens
20:02:18 <Dot> mini golf place that serves you cocktails while you play apparently
20:02:24 <Dot> i would like to be home with internet
20:02:24 <DuB`> fun
20:02:44 <skram> In apprenticeship businesses theres usually a sort of hierarchy you know
20:02:52 <skram> at least where i went
20:04:32 <Dot> im no apprentice skram!
20:04:52 <skram> right
20:05:26 <skram> oh yeah you had apprenticeship offers but you just put on your big lad pants and skipped all that didnt ya
20:05:36 <Dot> i did!
20:05:51 <Dot> also i have been keeping an eye out for hazing, nothing yet, im very suspicious
20:06:02 <DuB`> <_<
20:06:03 <DuB`> >_>
20:06:36 <skram> I need to plan a prank on one of my coworkers
20:06:43 <skram> its revenge
20:06:56 <skram> he wrote a joke on my helmet, whats the appropriate amount of escalation?
20:07:02 <Dot> salt in the sugur
20:07:27 <skram> or sugar in the salt
20:09:53 <Runbunny> crumble his cookies.
20:10:18 <skram> you guys are bad at this
20:10:32 <Dot> the good old windows upsidown screen? with screenshot of correct way up set as background
20:11:34 <skram> what if i fill his locker with packing peanuts
20:12:01 <Dot> or snakes
20:12:16 <skram> can you buy snakes on amazon
20:12:21 <Dot> probably
20:12:33 <Dot> also i will be sending your choclate this weekend skram
20:12:47 <skram> coolio
20:12:48 <Dot> i went to talk to them last saturday and forgot post office is closed on sunday
20:13:04 <skram> did you get it sorted legally or did you have to use your underground contacts again
20:13:21 <Dot> i went and asked them and had them check
20:13:30 <Dot> explained the choclate was milkless
20:14:31 <skram> Even if it wasnt, the norwegian Health Authorities say dairy from EEA is fine
20:14:33 <skram> its weird
20:14:38 <skram> we're probably gonna go to jail
20:14:43 <skram> ill try to get you extradited
20:14:48 <DuB`> :D
20:14:49 <Runbunny> Well Jonas. I usually don't bully people.
20:15:01 <Runbunny> anti bully ranger transform and all that.
20:15:15 <skram> its not bullying
20:15:19 <skram> it was funny
20:15:47 <Runbunny> bully!
20:15:58 <skram> im the one being bullied then???
20:16:17 <skram> you should be proud of me for standing up for myself
20:17:06 <Runbunny> What did that other guy write on your helmet?
20:17:27 <Runbunny> It was probably "Jonas" or something.
20:17:45 <skram> something about Jazz
20:18:03 <skram> out of context it doesnt sound bad, but i assure you my honor has been besmirched
20:18:14 <Runbunny> The harlot!
20:20:35 <skram> See, Anders gets it.
20:20:53 <skram> I practiced my danish again today Anders, im like 40% fluent now
