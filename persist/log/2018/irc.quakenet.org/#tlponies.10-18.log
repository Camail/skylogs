00:34:05 <skrm> ill make a table for two cris
00:34:13 <skrm> candle lights, a nice red
00:34:15 <Crisium> skram i want to visit you
00:34:17 <skrm> its gonna be v romantic
00:34:20 <Crisium> but no passport
00:34:51 <skrm> might need a visa too?
00:35:08 <Crisium> do you need that to visit countries?
00:36:01 <Crisium> i've never had a passport ever.  other countries i've been to: canada, germany, romania, afghanistan, kuwait
00:36:21 <skrm> not sure
00:36:26 <skrm> i need one to visit you at least
00:36:44 <Crisium> iv never visaed or passported
00:36:50 <Crisium> those are for the weak
00:36:59 <Crisium> all you need is guns
00:37:44 <skrm> i dont have any guns D:
00:37:54 <Crisium> wow what a beta
00:37:59 <Crisium> git guns, git good
00:38:13 <skrm> you need a reason to have a gun
00:38:15 <skrm> i dont have any
00:38:22 <Crisium> killing enemies?
00:38:44 <skrm> if i put that on my application i might be put in jail instead maybe
00:38:53 <Crisium> :(
00:39:11 <skrm> i could take up mooose hunting i guess
00:39:24 <Crisium> those moose arent gonna shoot themselves
00:39:48 <skrm> i mean most of them die to cars anyway
00:40:02 <skrm> but eating roadkill is illegal and probably unsanitary
00:40:08 <Crisium> yeah thats gross
00:40:17 <Crisium> but if you shoot moose, you can eat and make clothes out of him
00:40:23 <carcinization> night all
00:40:28 <Crisium> gn rei
00:40:32 <skrm> night reif
00:40:44 <skrm> true dat
00:40:51 <skrm> moose meat is good stuff
00:41:05 <Bio> BUT you gotta be gentle wid it
00:41:13 <Bio> just like a sweeeedish laaady
00:41:27 <Crisium> Bio do you play with Michigan wildlife
00:41:34 <skrm> :D
00:41:56 <Crisium> skrm is norway yes?
00:41:59 <skrm> yas
00:42:23 <Crisium> norway has a lot of coastline
00:42:27 <Crisium> thats about all i know
00:43:02 <Bio> i wanna go hunting skrm
00:43:10 <Bio> git me some deer meet
00:43:14 <Crisium> become predator and hunt humans
00:43:25 <skrm> hunting is kinda boring honestly
00:43:47 <skrm> you just sit there and wait for some gnarly dogs to chase some animal to the palce you're sitting
00:43:58 <Crisium> if you hunt humans its exciting
00:44:09 <skrm> p illegal too
00:44:18 <Crisium> not if they are enemy of the state
00:45:21 <skrm> that means you either gotta be dog the bounty hunter or a pmc
00:45:31 <skrm> i guess you could join blackwater or some other dodgy operation
00:45:51 <Crisium> um Norway is in NATO you scrub
00:45:55 <Crisium> you can kill any Taliban
00:46:09 <skrm> ooooh
00:46:40 <skrm> theres a big nato thing around where i live atm
00:47:04 <skrm> met some austrian jägerkommando type dudes in their gelandewagen at the grocery store yesterday
00:47:05 <Crisium> i dont think i ever saw on norweges
00:47:21 <Crisium> i saw a lot of Dutch and Polish and Czech
00:47:29 <Bio> god i wanna visit the euro horses 
00:47:41 <Bio> take me to eat some fuck in sausages
00:48:52 <Crisium> sassage
00:51:28 <skrm> i dont know where they did the things cris but i think they did the ISAF thing
00:51:43 <Crisium> oh i did that for 7 months
00:55:34 <skrm> there was some stuff in the news about a base in meymaneh(??) because it was bad

01:47:14 <Bio> PONIES
01:47:15 <Bio> is gud
01:56:21 <Crisium> yee
02:02:05 <Bio> I get to go out to lunch with a client tomorrow
02:02:08 <Bio> free lunch
02:02:15 <Bio> and it counts as fuckin time worked
02:02:17 <Bio> hellz yeah
02:05:50 <Crisium> woot
02:05:52 <skrm> you're a fuckin big wig now bio
02:08:36 <Camail> skram me and dub are trying monk/wizard and it's weird as hell
02:08:41 <Camail> but it's meta, apparently
02:09:15 <Camail> you could be are necro daddy and send your mage boys to help us
02:09:20 <Camail> our*
02:10:29 <skrm> hell yeah
02:11:06 <skrm> not played necroboi at all yet
02:12:16 <Camail> the meta build uses pets
02:12:23 <Camail> so its like emo witch doctor
02:12:27 <Camail> with somehow MORE skulls
02:13:06 <skrm> perfect
02:13:27 <Camail> dub and my builds are basically filled out, he has a few things to work out but its all functional
02:13:39 <Camail> so we can get you those sweet set pieces
02:16:05 <skrm> come to papa
02:46:21 <DuB`> Camail, got a set of ancient firebird shoulders... with the same weird bad stats as the others I have >_>
02:46:33 <Camail> good
02:46:59 <DuB`> Got ancient deathwish after 4 more rolls
02:47:06 <DuB`> Not sure what to reroll on it...
02:47:16 <DuB`> The 980 vit seems so niiiice
02:48:09 <Camail> dmg% int vit seems standard
02:48:18 <Camail> some people have traded vit for area%
02:48:30 <DuB`> Current int vit speed
02:48:38 <Camail> i'd trade speed
02:48:40 <DuB`> Could even reroll main base damage to try for max
02:48:42 <Camail> because its a channel build
02:48:54 <DuB`> Does speed not affect tick rate of damage or whatever?
02:49:05 <Camail> i dont believe so, but i will check
02:50:48 <Camail> reading this right now https://us.battle.net/forums/en/d3/topic/8770117237#5
02:52:47 <DuB`> Eh yeah I'll do speed
02:52:55 <Camail> it looks like tickrate does have a smooth correlation with atttack rate
02:52:58 <DuB`> Max 10% dmg while max spd is 7%
02:53:00 <Camail> the break points quantize it
02:53:06 <Camail> doesnt*
02:53:22 <Camail> that 7% might actually be useless if it doesnt pass a breakpoint
02:53:41 <Camail> but yea 10% damage is better, especially because AS doesnt affect meteor either, right
02:54:04 <Camail> thats why people use furnace instead of BoP on crus
02:54:25 <Camail> its a slower weapon with equal dps so its max damage is actually higher, which condemn cares about, not AS
02:55:53 <Camail> LUL, d3 is secretly framelocked to 60
02:55:57 <Camail> like a god damned fighting game
02:56:08 <DuB`> Actually
02:56:28 <DuB`> The Etched Sigil which is proccing my meteors as I channel has tick breakpoints?
02:56:32 <DuB`> Hmm
02:56:55 <Camail> that post i linked has some tables to look at
02:57:46 <DuB`> https://us.battle.net/forums/en/d3/topic/20759186011
02:57:56 <DuB`> For ESigil specifically...
02:57:59 <DuB`> I am confus now
02:59:37 <Camail> i kinda get it
02:59:42 <Camail> but some acronyms are a mystery
03:01:23 <Camail> fpa is frames per attack, i think
03:01:35 <Camail> and fSigil frames until the proc
03:03:00 <DuB`> Oh lol I can't go above T6 on my wizard
03:03:03 <DuB`> Haven't done solo grifts
03:03:10 <Camail> so basically, every 60 frames it can proc(?) and you want the fpa to be divisible by 60 because any excess frames that aren't being use to complete an attack are wasted after the 60th frame
03:03:26 <Camail> i think thats too complicated, given how often your AS might change as your build changes
03:04:07 <Camail> its not worth keeping something that mare or may not provide a speed boost, when you can get a damage boost that enters dmg calculations so early
03:04:20 <DuB`> Ye
03:04:26 <Camail> given that AS is additive and damage goes into a multiplicative calculation
03:04:50 <Camail> also yea firebird seems shit for solo
03:05:01 <Camail> i cant even to t1 on my monk
03:05:08 <Camail> because i rolled dmg off both my weapons
03:06:21 <Bio> asdf
03:06:27 <Bio> zelda tomorrow I think
03:06:34 <BioSleep> nnnnnnnnn
03:06:55 <Camail> nn
03:10:34 <Camail> and i think 3man rifts will be better because we are adding a DPS
03:10:56 <Camail> so we will have 2 dps and 1 tank, which is great
03:58:40 <Camail> d3 is lagging hard for me, first time since i came back

20:15:16 <Zounds> capturing him between a glass and a piece of paper makes it easy to throw him out
20:15:22 <DoT|Phone> small ones I'm fine with and I havnt choke across a big hairy one in the wild yet
20:15:28 <DoT|Phone> but the large spindly ones
20:15:31 <DoT|Phone> I do not like
20:15:55 <DoT|Phone> their legs just freak me out
20:16:44 <DoT|Phone> leg span this guy would have only just fit in a standard glass
20:16:52 <Zounds> hehe
20:17:33 <DoT|Phone> I used a broom. get then into the end and they can't really go anywhere due to the bristles
20:17:41 <DoT|Phone> then shake them out a window
20:18:00 <Zounds> I have no real love for spiders but there are not many that can hurt you in the UK

21:08:33 <reification> and i learned our first mp was Sir Frederick Wellington John Fitzwygram
21:09:22 <reification> "He held the seat until 1900, being interested in military and horse related matters in the House of Commons. He wrote an influential book on the care and management of horses - Horses and Stables"
