10:32:13 <skrm> :D
10:37:02 <Dot> you also have healp skrm?
10:45:55 <skrm> Well I have you
10:46:42 <Dot> i dont seem to get paid though

10:53:42 <skrm> management said noperino to pay raise Dot 
10:53:47 <skrm> nothing i can do
10:53:59 <Dot> understandable
11:07:45 <Dot> hey skrm, if you took 2 levels of fighter your dorf would have action surge
11:08:25 <skrm> hey dot if i took 2 levels of barbarian my dorf would be A LEVEL 7 BARBARIAN
11:08:27 <skrm> wait
11:08:29 <skrm> 8!
11:08:32 <Dot> 8!
11:08:41 <Dot> 7 is cool, you get a tihng if i recall
11:08:54 <Dot> and 8 does get you an ASI, but after that?? then wat?
11:13:48 <skrm> well at level 10 i get brutal strike iirc
11:14:23 <Dot> ah, lvl 9
11:14:27 <Dot> Beginning at 9th levei, you can roll one additional
11:14:27 <Dot> weapon damage die when determining the extra
11:14:27 <Dot> damage for a criticai hit with a melee attack.
11:14:45 <Dot> barbarian actually gets pretty solid stuff right the way through
11:16:26 <skrm> indeed
11:16:32 <skrm> and at some level you get another die
11:16:38 <Dot> 13
11:19:49 <Dot> 3 lvls in fighter, take champion and you get improved crit chance
11:19:52 <Dot> 19-20
