11:12:18 <Phearlock> And it's still coming down so thick I can't see the other side of the valley
11:12:32 <Phearlock> Spring please.
11:12:51 <Dot`> Phear!
11:12:56 <Dot`> it snowed here
11:13:00 <Dot`> not even enough to settle

17:46:29 <Bio> member its a glowy spider
17:52:22 <Dot`> yea, thought so, just saw the spell in the sidebar on roll20
17:55:18 <skram> Good evening mr. Zounds!

17:56:49 <skram> I should get some gin then
17:59:21 <Dot`> confirmed skram needs to drink in order to get through a dnd session
18:01:08 <skram> Its for that extra grumpiness
18:04:37 <Bio> how else to sound like a grumpy gruff dorf
18:07:12 <Dot`> be norwegion
18:09:48 <Dot`> i look forward to skram using his artisans blessing to make things
18:10:17 <skram> first one is gonna be a a bronze bust
18:10:20 <skram> except its a butt
18:12:44 <Dot`> such class
18:15:54 <Dot`> so over 15 days you could technicly make plate armour
18:16:24 <Dot`> is that how it works?
18:16:56 <skram> uuh probably not
18:17:41 <Dot`> you make 100 gp worth of metal turn into something of your choosing
18:17:58 <skram> true
18:18:14 <skram> i suppose a kind gm would allow me to make pieces of plate mail
18:18:20 <Dot`> and full plate is made of multiple pieces of metal
18:18:34 <skram> but
18:18:40 <skram> plate mail costs 1500g
18:18:47 <Dot`> so 15 days
18:18:56 <skram> but surely it does not contain 1500g worth of metal
18:19:07 <skram> like it weighs 60 pounds or something
18:19:13 <skram> how much is 1 lbs of steel
18:19:24 <Dot`> well, the spell ia a bit weird you see
18:19:28 <Dot`> you could make a spear
18:19:33 <Dot`> thats mostly wood
18:19:41 <Dot`> where doesnt the wood come from?? magic
18:19:52 <skram> fucking love magi
18:19:53 <skram> c
18:20:12 <Dot`> it requires the metal for casting, but the whole object created apparently doesnt need to be only metal
18:20:40 <skram> sure sure
18:20:48 <skram> but does plate mail contain 1500g worth of metal
18:21:04 <Dot`> 'The metal irretrievably coalesces and
18:21:04 <Dot`> transforms into the creation at the ritual’s end, magically
18:21:04 <Dot`> forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.'
18:21:15 <Dot`> its 1500 gp of materials
18:21:23 <skram> YES
18:21:41 <skram> but my question is does plate mail contain 1500g worth of metals
18:21:44 <skram> it costs 1500g
18:21:53 <Phearlock> No
18:22:03 <Dot`> what im trying to say is, all i can go off for price is the book amount
18:22:04 <skram> does that mean i need to buy 1500g of steel if I were to forge it
18:22:14 <Dot`> unsless you want to calculate weight to metal ration 
18:22:22 <skram> well obviously
18:22:39 <Bio> lol wouldn't it be cheaper to just buy one then
18:22:51 <Dot`> small towns dont have plate bio
18:22:52 <skram> labour is free, it has a given weight and raw materials have a given cost per unit of mass
18:23:27 <Dot`> ah, so you want to account for labour in the 1500 gp
18:23:34 <Dot`> meaning thew actuall cost to be far lower
18:23:49 <Dot`> thats a dangerous game to play skrammen
18:23:57 <skram> well thats how it would work isnt it
18:24:31 <Dot`> so then assuming 1500 gp as base cost i guess i need to add 50% to all items now to account for labour and shop upkeep
18:24:38 <Dot`> markup*
18:24:39 <Dot`> :P
18:25:12 <skram> no the 1500gp includes the cost of labour
18:25:22 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
18:25:32 <Dot`> not anymore!
18:25:41 <Dot`> but really, you make sense, i will need to look into DnD labour costs apparently
18:25:50 <Dot`> and material costs
18:25:50 <skram> every day an adventure
18:26:01 <skram> how much does a steel ingot cost in your universe
18:26:07 <skram> and also is steel invented yet
18:26:12 <Dot`> 1 million
18:26:13 <Dot`> copper
18:26:33 <skram> so thats like 1000 golderinos
18:26:39 <Runbunny> Jonas
18:26:45 <Runbunny> How are you friend?
18:26:58 <skram> that means plate is so much cheaper than its cost of manufacture
18:27:05 <skram> I am well, Anders
18:27:09 <skram> How you been buddy
18:27:47 <Runbunny> Well it's alright I guess.
18:27:53 <Runbunny> I'm gonna order pizza today.
18:28:05 <Dot`> skram i havnt found iron yet, BUT
18:28:07 <Dot`> 3 gp 1 lb. of cloves or one pig
18:28:27 <skram> Its a pizza kind of day, Anders
18:28:34 <skram> Yes I will make my armor from pig bits
18:29:40 <Dot`> 1 sp per pound... that sounds cheap
18:30:27 <skram> so 15gp in materials to make a god damn set of plate armor
18:31:39 <Dot`> smiths have a good monopoly there
18:34:19 <Zounds> Why do you need armour anyway
18:34:21 <Zounds> just don't get hit
18:34:31 <Dot`> git gud
18:34:39 <skram> thats like the opposite of what i do zounds
18:37:38 <Phearlock> just take the dodge action every turn
18:37:42 <Phearlock> what could go wrong?
18:39:53 <skram> nothing probably
18:40:45 <Dot`> when you get into it skram this spell is REALLY weird
18:41:16 <Dot`> you can use any metal even gold coinds, as long as the cost works out the same
