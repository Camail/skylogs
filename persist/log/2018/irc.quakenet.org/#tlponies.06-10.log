18:26:44 <DuB`> Might have to hope to get lucky on strategy to catch VET, he's far outpacing everyone :T
18:27:45 <Cane> He's *still* improving his position. Dude's nuts right now.
18:28:43 <Cane> I wish Raikkonen could start near pole one of these days.
18:28:48 <Cane> He's like always in 6th.
18:29:08 <DuB`> I'd rather see him winning that vettel :P
