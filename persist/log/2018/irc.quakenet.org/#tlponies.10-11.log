06:49:37 <DuB`> Hahah cam
06:49:41 <DuB`> No dot. Nothing. T_T
06:50:10 <Camail> for some reason my cs group has become way less toxic
06:50:20 <Camail> probably because the one guy i hate doesnt play as much
06:50:34 <Camail> we're actually nice to each other which is weird

07:01:12 <DoT|Phone> stop being mean to ppl
07:01:18 <Camail> i am very nice!
07:01:24 <Camail> top 5 nice persons
07:01:46 <Camail> and being mean to you doesn't count because you are a phone
07:02:00 <Camail> and have no right until other AIs blossom and force us to face that
07:04:54 <DoT|Phone> I would like to not be a phone
07:05:49 <Camail> we all want you to get out of the phone
07:06:01 <Camail> big companies are slow and shitty

07:09:00 <Camail> neat! which part are you doing now
07:09:18 <Camail> i remember seeing a lot of hype around HLD but its art style put me off
07:10:01 <Camail> dot if i could somehow get crosscode to you, it's so good
07:10:25 <Camail> its the classic single player game inside of another game
07:10:38 <DoT|Phone> havnt played much. just started a new one yesterday to get the feel for it. Will probably jump back on my furthest save soon
07:10:50 <DoT|Phone> been sick so am a bit sluggish
07:10:59 <Camail> yea that makes sense
07:11:04 <Camail> just sleep more, all the time
07:11:17 <Camail> drug yourself, if needed
07:11:22 <Camail> morphine foreverrrrr
07:11:48 <DoT|Phone> but I have a job now. they expect me to show up EVERY day
07:11:57 <DoT|Phone> Mon to Fri
07:12:17 <DuB`> Travesty
07:13:34 <DoT|Phone> I am back in Bakewell Saturday night. I then have internet to look into crisscode
07:14:08 <Camail> can you believe the balls on those people
07:14:13 <Camail> 5 whole days, disgusting
07:16:23 <DoT|Phone> I still haven't tried that csgo 2 player thing
07:16:26 <DoT|Phone> one day
07:18:45 <Camail> yea its quite fun
07:19:14 <Camail> man, a streamer is playing puzzle pirates for some reason and i am having intense flashbacks
07:19:31 <DoT|Phone> lol
07:19:35 <Camail> i just want to start a tlp crew and i literally have a ship and a house and a decent amount of money
07:19:44 <Camail> but holy shit i am so bad at that game now
07:20:38 <Camail> like jesus christ i was the highest rank possible for bilging and i cant even do that puzzle anymore
07:21:02 <DoT|Phone> that's some srs puzzling
07:21:39 <Camail> yea it was nice, i'd do some simple pirating if anyone was interested
07:21:42 <Camail> sadly i am naked
07:21:50 <Camail> because items decay in that game
07:21:59 <DoT|Phone> your always naked I thought
07:22:10 <Camail> i had a really really cool coat
07:23:28 <DoT|Phone> I would pirate with you cam. if I had internet
07:23:58 <Camail> i would be willing to, i 100% would not do bilging tho
07:24:09 <DoT|Phone> lol
07:24:13 <Camail> luckily the captain doesnt do that
07:24:47 <Camail> my sailing rank was around grand master, and i still have more of an idea how to do that
07:25:01 <Camail> but bilging is like, the most intense match 3 puzle game ever created
07:25:32 <Camail> if you're not doing 3x4 at minimum you are shit
07:25:38 <DoT|Phone> intense puzzle
07:25:48 <Camail> not like those shitty old person match 3s where all you do is match 3
07:25:53 <Camail> bitches dont even have crabs
07:25:56 <Camail> let alone puffer fish
07:26:56 <DoT|Phone> those amateurs
07:29:21 <DoT|Phone> almost made it to work

08:54:17 <Camail> .tell cane ahhhh pgl was hype despite the format! the grand finals had a really nice pace to it
08:55:43 <Cane> .tell Camail It was freaking great from beginning to end. First time I've been hyped about a duel tournament.

08:57:24 <Camail> .tell dub` if we dont CS then we should 2v2 in quake, that train ended after like 4 days...
08:57:38 <Camail> oh cool you're here cane
08:57:41 <Camail> that was nuuuuuuuuts
08:57:51 <Camail> rapha just turned it on
08:57:52 <Cane> I know right.
08:58:02 <Cane> I was a bit worried for him at first when he just went ham the first round.
08:58:05 <Cane> Super aggressive chance taking.
08:58:13 <Cane> And then BAMF. Best player in the world.
08:58:26 <Camail> rapha mentioned that people werent dealing with coollers pressure properly
08:58:42 <Camail> so i'm guessing that his response is a big reason why the pace was entertaining
08:59:06 <Cane> He said on his stream yesterday that he had to change up his play style between opponents a lot, so yeah, I'll bet.
08:59:18 <Cane> There were just a lot of solid games at PGL.
08:59:34 <Camail> and i'll admit it is cool that character stats change the game up
08:59:43 <Camail> maybe it could be less drastic but still, it was fun
09:00:01 <Camail> 2v2 is 10000 times better, everyone agrees there
09:00:07 <Camail> now we get to have TL streams
09:00:19 <Camail> the team of 2 dual champions
09:01:19 <Camail> i really want to get a working knowledge of quake, i could be enjoying it on a deeper level
09:01:28 <Cane> Yes please. Next tournament is both duel and 2v2, so we'll have lots of people practicing it again.
09:01:28 <Camail> i'll bug people tomorrow after i wake up
09:01:35 <Cane> And soon we'll have new game modes and shit too.
09:01:38 <Cane> And CTF is in the works.
09:02:14 <Camail> yea, with rapha being the face of the english speaking quake community, we have a chance to get a strong fotthold in the fps genre
09:03:06 <Cane> I hope the game grows a bit. It's a bit disheartening watching rapha sit in queue for 15 minutes.
09:03:17 <Camail> well...thats rapha
09:03:22 <Camail> he has 2.9k mmr
09:03:38 <Camail> and a 20:1 ratio...there is no one worthy of playing that man
09:03:43 <Cane> Yeah, I just feel like matchmaking should get more relaxed after the 10 minute mark lol
09:03:50 <Camail> its more concerning if someone like me can't queue
09:04:13 <Camail> yea, MM is really hard to program
09:04:35 <Camail> anyway i should actually be sleeping, good night

21:29:31 <Zounds> Camail: FFXIV pretty fun so far
21:29:52 <Camail> yea, what class are you playing?
21:30:00 <Zounds> I started as a marauder
21:30:05 <Zounds> But I swapped over to rogue
21:30:22 <Zounds> Ninja now
21:31:07 <Camail> nice, i only ever played dragoon
21:32:44 <Camail> i always had the issue of not wanting to learn a dungeon before doing it because i was playing for the story
21:33:04 <Camail> i can only imagine how much better the game is for people who actually play the ff series
21:33:30 <Zounds> It's the first final fantasy game I've ever played
21:33:50 <Zounds> Except for 11
21:34:08 <Zounds> But I didn't play that too much ^^
21:34:13 <Camail> so have you finished the msq of the base game
21:34:33 <Zounds> yes very recently
21:34:45 <Zounds> on to the patch content right now
21:34:59 <Camail> so you havent done expansion content yet?
21:35:04 <Zounds> nope
21:35:15 <Camail> ok i will warn you then, its not a spoiler at all
21:35:20 <Camail> like half the voice cast was changed
21:35:27 <Zounds> Aye my brother said
21:35:28 <Camail> which is good sometimes, bad other times
21:35:31 <Zounds> That's alright
21:35:39 <Camail> i was not aware of it and thought i was going insane
21:36:12 <Camail> japanese devs LOVE british accents
21:36:15 <Camail> entirely too much, imo
21:36:26 <Zounds> I'm liking that aspect to be honest
21:36:38 <Zounds> It's the same in dark souls
21:36:47 <Zounds> I get to hear welsh and irish and proper scottish accents
21:37:08 <Zounds> rather than bbc english or james bond
21:38:12 <Zounds> That elven NPC though Urianger if you remember him
21:38:31 <Zounds> He is rather fanciful with his language haha
21:38:37 <Camail> ok i think i mostly skipped the voices after a point
21:38:57 <Camail> i binged the story pretty hard so i just read the text
21:39:05 <Zounds> Well I'm sort of doing the same
21:39:14 <Zounds> I read the text way before they say most of it
21:39:24 <Zounds> doesn't bother me if I don't hear it spoken aloud
21:39:35 <Camail> jrpgs are very wordy
21:39:53 <Camail> sometimes i actually let them talk and finish a sentence, then pretend i'm an editor and skip the rest
21:39:54 <Zounds> https://i.imgur.com/BnqXZUw.png
21:40:00 <Camail> "you've said enough, NEXT"
21:40:07 <Zounds> The amount of fetch quests is a bit silly though
21:40:16 <Camail> thats a pretty human you've made there
21:40:22 <Camail> oh yea i didnt do allt he quests
21:40:36 <Camail> i never even leveled a profession
21:40:39 <Zounds> I've done a few here and there
21:40:50 <Zounds> Mostly mainlining the MSQ and anything my brother says is useful
21:41:06 <Zounds> Unlocked the first allied raid which I'll try next time
21:41:15 <Camail> themsq gives a ton of xp and your xp reqs for other jobs after your first are lessened
21:41:26 <Camail> so it only makes sense to focus on one until you are caught up
21:41:59 <Zounds> I tried the PvP
21:42:05 <Zounds> We won so I was happy
21:42:29 <Camail> all the deprecated tomestone equipment is also kinda weird
21:42:34 <Camail> i never tried pvp
21:43:03 <Camail> i did it in wow but honestly didnt feel like the skills in ff14 were very interesting for that kind of thing
21:43:24 <Zounds> I don't think the ff14 pvp holds a candle to wows honestly
21:43:38 <Camail> its designed for teamwork
21:43:42 <Camail> tanks are TANKS
21:43:46 <Zounds> So is WoWs these days
21:44:13 <Zounds> Difference is when you want to interrupt or stun someone in WoW it's snappy
21:44:24 <Zounds> FFXIV is a bit floaty and slow for the pvp
21:44:27 <Zounds> Though it was alright
21:45:47 <Camail> i'd say you could hop right into heavensward
21:45:54 <Camail> unless you dont meet the level requirements
21:46:19 <Zounds> I'm 53 so that's no issue
21:46:49 <Camail> heavensword has the coolest cinematic moment in a boss fight
21:47:04 <Camail> i dont want to tell you who because that spoils immediately
21:47:16 <Zounds> I'll look forward to it
21:47:43 <Zounds> The soundtrack during some of the bosses is pretty sweet
21:47:45 <Zounds> some real bangers
21:48:03 <Camail> oh also there's a universal mechanice where a circle surrounds your character and arrows point towards you, thats ff14 language for everyone needing to group up
21:48:22 <Camail> its not entirely obvious and they never teach you, and it doesnt come up in most bosses
21:48:46 <Camail> but i wiped a raid cuz i never saw it before
21:48:52 <Zounds> I've been watching vids before the encounters so I don't embarrass myself
21:48:59 <Camail> muh immersion
21:49:09 <Camail> i was being really selfish in that game
21:49:34 <Camail> but like...it was either play like THAT or quit soooooo
21:50:40 <DuB`> I asked for like 10 sauce packets at Taco Bell and got like 30
21:50:41 <DuB`> aaaaaa
21:50:53 <Zounds> I got randomly invited to an FC which turned out pretty cool
21:50:55 <Camail> ask for 5 next time
21:51:15 <Zounds> Big house to chill out in
21:51:32 <Camail> yea i got a random fc invite, then proceeded to never talk to them again but hey
21:52:01 <Zounds> Yeah you never know what they'll be like with a random invite
21:52:16 <Zounds> Seem like decent folk this time though

21:54:46 <Zounds> I've yet to find any real use for the ninja movement ability
21:54:56 <Zounds> the 20yd teleport
21:55:09 <Zounds> I thought I would use it all the time but turns out I don't
21:55:17 <skram> Hi.
21:55:35 <reification> hello skram
21:55:39 <Zounds> I'm probably just a turboshitter losing out on half a second dps though
21:55:42 <Zounds> so I should fix that
21:56:04 <Zounds> ay skram
21:57:14 <Camail> dragoon was soooo boring until 50
21:57:31 <Camail> dps rotations at lower levels just suck in general
21:57:44 <Zounds> rogues wasn't anything special either
21:57:47 <DuB`> is that my favorite onkel
21:57:56 <Zounds> as soon as I got my 2nd mudra things got a bit better
21:58:09 <Zounds> 3rd one and now I'm spinning plates and its very fun
21:58:20 <Runbunny> Oh boy. let me tell you about black mage. 
21:58:54 <Runbunny> Just fire till you're out of mana then ice till you have full mana. 
21:59:46 <Zounds> ninja seems pretty involved tbh
22:00:02 <Zounds> vulnerability up to apply whenever possible, slashing debuff and DoT to maintain
22:00:06 <Zounds> self buff to maintain
22:00:18 <Zounds> positional attacks
22:00:37 <Zounds> plus the whole mudra thing is like mini-ez invoker but still pretty good for an MMO class
22:00:53 <Zounds> 20 seconds punishment for a fuckup
22:02:25 <Runbunny> It's pretty rough.
22:02:34 <Runbunny> What server are you on?
22:02:38 -!- tredc [~tredc@c83-251-171-164.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:02:38 <Zounds> Zodiark
22:03:47 <Camail> they changed cross class skills just after i quit
22:04:10 <Camail> i cant remember what the change was but it used to be pretty grindy
22:04:18 <Zounds> yeah my bro mentioned those, I didn't have to level any other job
22:04:27 <Zounds> I just got the debuffs and utility stuff as I leveled
22:06:12 <Runbunny> I remember that, from when it was reborn. "So you want to be a mage? well have fun being an archer"
22:28:40 <Camail> ooh, dragoon got a fancy bar for their refreshing passive buff
22:29:07 <Camail> i might eventually come back to that game
22:29:16 <Camail> maybe before the next expansion
22:29:36 <Camail> i got the game super cheap because it was pre stromblood
22:29:55 <Zounds> ah too bad you're NA
22:30:07 <Zounds> Would be fun to do some co-operative stabbing and slashing
22:35:38 <Camail> yea i was thinking the same
22:35:52 <Camail> but server transfers are a pain and lag is annoying
22:36:14 <Camail> and if runbunny played then you'd be with two cat girls
22:36:30 <skram> what game are you talking about
22:36:37 <Runbunny> FFXIV
22:36:42 <skram> oh
22:36:43 <Zounds> That's alright i'm a potato loli
22:37:17 <Camail> nah, you're a regular normal looking human
22:37:34 <Runbunny> Cat girls though..
22:41:20 <Runbunny> Dang now I kinda want to play again :/
22:42:29 <Camail> i just started reading stormblood dragoon guides
22:42:31 <Camail> and i had to stop
22:42:40 <Camail> because iw as getting an itch that i can't scratch
22:45:43 <Zounds> :D
22:51:44 <Runbunny> Oh noes.
22:58:57 <Camail> reification they're dong another experimental daily in spire
22:59:01 <Camail> it looks...weird
22:59:31 <reification> i shall try it

23:03:53 <Zounds> zerged it a bit since everyone is overgeared but it was nice
23:15:16 <Runbunny> I don't remember my login so I can't even check if I had a character on that server you play on Zounds.
23:16:33 <Zounds> its a fairly small server so its unlikely
23:16:55 <Zounds> at least I think it is
23:17:03 <Zounds> it was recommended when I went to make a character
23:17:58 <Runbunny> Ahh then probably not.
23:26:54 <Zounds> g'night
23:38:24 <DuB`> Do I watch TWO critrole today?
23:38:25 <DuB`> HMMM
23:42:02 <skram> did u eat ur vegetabels
23:42:19 <DuB`> There were some veggies in my taco bell yes
23:42:56 <skram> v good
23:45:55 <Camail> thats a big quest dub
23:45:59 <Camail> think long and hard
23:46:04 <Camail> the answer is yes tho
23:46:13 <Camail> or play quake with me
23:46:15 <Camail> only two options
