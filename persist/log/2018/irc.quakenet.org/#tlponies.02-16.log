01:40:24 <Dot`> scheduling is such fun...
01:40:48 <Micen> I think that that is like 90% of D&D
01:40:49 <Dot`> sure micen, depending on more precise times, i can probably play
01:41:17 <Micen> okay, ill let you know when i hear back from her about her current schedule.

09:31:58 <Micen|Droid> Yo
09:32:28 <Dot`> 2 hours before my dnd time? you mean the 3om start time or the start time we tried and failed on friday
09:32:34 <Micen|Droid> You interupted me going down pony memory lane on youtube 
09:33:32 <Micen|Droid> Somewhere around there yes. 
09:34:17 <Dot`> i gave you 2 options
09:34:38 <Micen|Droid> The normal sunday time 5am my time
09:34:58 <Micen|Droid> Two hours before yours at 7am ish my time
09:35:16 <Micen|Droid> Sorry I misread it. 
09:36:10 <Dot`> so 10 am UTC
09:36:11 <Dot`> i tihnk
09:36:18 <Dot`> no
09:36:30 <Dot`> maybe...
09:37:00 <Dot`> 10am my time is 6 pm Perth time
09:37:14 <Dot`> but my friday session was scheduled for 11 pm
09:37:14 <Micen|Droid> Did I do my math wrong? 
09:37:21 <Micen|Droid> Its entirely possible. 
09:37:28 <Dot`> https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/
09:39:18 <Camail> ok so lesson learned, there is a soft border to the subnautica map filled with big fuck you monsters

09:39:27 <Dot`> haha
09:39:34 <Camail> which has a lot less to do with lore an more to do with murdering you
09:39:36 <Micen|Droid> Okay bec (the gf) said after 6 her time was good  so o figured an hour after that soft time in case things go over
09:40:34 <Dot`> how big an area they give you though cam? did it take you 10 minutes or 2 hours to get to the edge
09:41:17 <Camail> i dont know how big it is, i only hit the edge in one direction
09:41:28 <Camail> which was about 1800m from the escape pod
09:47:39 <Camail> I suspect the pod is near the middle
09:53:21 <Dot`> would make sense
09:59:52 <Dot`> so do we havea  day for session 0 micen? or just a time so far
10:02:04 <Micen|Droid> So far just a time. And then after that sit down with fleshing out character creation with each person seperately. 
10:10:16 <Dot`> what level start?
10:10:44 <Micen|Droid> I was going to do level 1 just because we have two new players. 
10:11:08 <Dot`> so there wont be TOO mch fleshing out of characters

20:10:50 <Zounds> she has good hips
20:11:02 <Zounds> and I kinda liked pandaria

20:11:39 <skrm> i disliked almost everything about pandaria
20:12:05 <skrm> draenor was pretty fun

20:27:37 <skrm> I disagree zounds, vanilla wasnt casual friendly in the least
20:27:43 <skrm> honestly it wasnt friendly to anyone
20:27:57 <Camail> if we're talking about vanilla wow, hell yea it was terrible for casuals
20:28:12 <Camail> i never even hit level cap the grind was so fucked
20:28:25 <Zounds> It was relative to other games at the time
20:28:57 <Zounds> As long as you didn't expect to clear every raid you could have a lot of fun as a casual
20:29:29 <Camail> i think the gulf between casual and raiding guild is very large
20:29:35 <Camail> like, job vs not job
20:30:12 <Yoltphone> I was at mc donalds at 6pm dot
20:30:18 <Yoltphone> üòÅ
20:30:41 <skrm> I dont know zounds, just levelign to 60 took you 20 days if you were quick and most quests were bland and unimpressive
20:30:59 <Zounds> Was WoW your first MMO?
20:31:07 <Zounds> I came from SWG and WoW was babys first in comparison
20:31:14 <Zounds> a lot better, but also very straightforward
20:31:23 <Camail> why does WoW being less shit than old mmos make it good?
20:31:44 <Camail> we can all agree it learned a lot from old school stuff
20:31:52 <Camail> and by far it is better for casuals
20:32:00 <Camail> doesn't make it fun for them
20:32:15 <Camail> but then again
20:32:31 <Camail> the casuals at the VERY beginning would know about the boring old stuff and like the novel new stuff
20:32:32 <Zounds> What is "casual" has changed a lot over the years kinda what I was originally saying
20:33:35 <Zounds> You say the quests were bland skram but it having quests at all is relatively "casual"
20:33:53 <skrm> I played AA and GW before wow

20:34:35 <Zounds> Nowdays you aint far behind the gear curve with a few hours a week so yes it's better for casuals now
20:34:49 <skrm> my point is
20:35:26 <skrm> i have 1 day played at 110 and I feel like I have come as far as I did after like 50 in ye olde times
20:36:04 <skrm> very rewarding if you have a group of nerds but also a lot of work
20:37:13 <Zounds> Personally I much prefer older versions of WoW to modern day
20:37:31 <Zounds> Even playing on a private server last year I had a lot of fun getting a guy to 60 and raiding a bit
20:38:39 <skrm> I mean I did the same and had a bunch of fun but I wonder how much of that is because I played day and night through all of that before
20:39:25 <Zounds> I think it's just way more engaging
20:39:38 <Zounds> All the mini stories you create just by leveling
20:40:28 <Camail> I'm gonna say thats an individual experience thing, my experience in wow was that I was doing the same thing over and over again
20:40:37 <Camail> that's 100% not a design feature
20:40:49 <skrm> I think some of it came from the fact that there were no cross-realm interaction, so every realm was its own thing and had its own lore
20:41:34 <Zounds> Yeh you're still doing the same thing over and over again today in WoW cam
20:41:36 <Zounds> that much hasn't changed
20:42:06 <Zounds> Though the raids are better now I'd say
20:42:08 <skrm> Its all kobolds of different shapes
20:42:21 <Zounds> Well more interesting mechanics in the boss fights at least
20:42:35 <skrm> true true
20:43:40 <skrm> Remember nefarius in BWL? He had an ability that just broke your hunter weapon mid-fight and you had to bring at least 1 spare and do repairs between tries
20:43:56 <skrm> lots of un-fun mechanics 
20:44:15 <Zounds> Yeah I did almost everything except Naxx
20:44:19 <Zounds> never set foot in there

20:45:30 <Zounds> Honestly I was at my happiest just farming in AV all day
20:45:39 <Zounds> I probably would get bored pretty quick doing that these days
20:46:09 <Zounds> Now that I am older and harder to please :p

20:49:23 <skrm> Ah, the 12 hour AV battles

20:49:30 <skrm> before pvp gear really was a thing
20:49:49 <skrm> and you gathered shit to summon bosses and whatnot
20:50:35 <skrm> I'd just hide in bushes with elf stealth and aimed shot unsuspecting horde scum
20:52:21 <Zounds> A noble endevour
21:10:24 <Camail> alliance children...
21:16:17 <Zounds> ~30% of the horde are blood elves
21:16:25 <Zounds> they lost their balls a long time ago
21:41:30 <Dot`> skrm
21:41:50 <skrm> yeah buddy
