22:40:32 <skram> mibr
22:40:37 <skram> now thats a blast from the past

23:11:14 <reification> any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic; any technology that cannot make catgirls is insufficiently advanced
23:14:32 <Runbunny> The technology is there. It's just trial,error and a lack of ethics from here. And well a ton of money :/
23:15:05 <skram> no anders iam not funding your catgirl project
23:16:36 <Runbunny> That the thing Jonas. Would you fund gene therapy of genetic diseases?

23:27:33 <DuB`> It's the road to CATGIRLS
23:27:51 <skram> y'all need jesus
