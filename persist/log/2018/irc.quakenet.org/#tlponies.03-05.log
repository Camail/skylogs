00:40:53 <Bio> time to wash the swole off
01:10:45 <Bio> all clean
01:33:57 <Camail> what a stroy
01:34:00 <Camail> story*
01:59:14 <Bio> i'm a master storyteller cam
01:59:15 <Bio> you know this
01:59:28 <Camail> indeed
02:33:49 <Cane> .tell Dot` https://i.imgur.com/m2bXvFu.gifv
02:34:37 <Camail> god thats some ptsd
02:34:48 <Camail> i remember it being darker
02:35:50 <Cane> It was, this is modded and probably had the brightness increased for the video.
02:39:42 <Camail> then the mind melting bullshit happened at the end...i didnt sign up for that
02:40:07 <Camail> you go in killing bandits, and come out getting brain fucked by a mutant
02:47:43 <Cane> I remember the first time you meet the controller in Agroprom underground. The scripted event where he comes out behind you when you walk down the hallway. Nearly pissed my pants.
02:56:24 <Camail> and thats the place where you find strelok's secret stash, which is like the coolest missable storyline ever
02:56:43 <Camail> well, the flash drive that points to his stash

10:22:47 <skram> Good morning Dot`_!
10:24:44 <Dot`_> skram!
10:24:55 <Dot`_> so i did some research this morning
10:25:03 <skram> oh boy
10:25:04 <Dot`_> full plate weighs 65 lb
10:25:16 <Dot`_> and 1 lb of metal is 1 gp
10:25:16 <skram> correct
10:25:37 <Dot`_> so i was thinking of allowing TJ that full plate
10:25:48 <Dot`_> because its only a short campagn 
10:25:55 <Dot`_> and he really wants full plate
10:26:17 <skram> alright
10:26:31 <Dot`_> you good with that?
10:26:49 <skram> you mean through my channel divinity?
10:27:06 <Dot`_> yea, once you get back to phandalin and get the iron
10:27:54 <skram> alright
10:28:08 <Dot`_> "alright" sounds grudging
10:28:40 <skram> nah im just thinking about how to use this leverage to my advantage Dot`_
10:28:45 <skram> he has no money so maybe he can be my butler
10:28:46 <Dot`_> haha
10:29:11 <skram> he does have that bitchin' gold chain thing...
10:29:42 <Dot`_> that would be low
10:30:04 <skram> im nothing if not petty
10:30:14 <Dot`_> he has armour wirth 200 gold that i am sure the smith will take for 65 lb of iron
10:30:58 <Dot`_> its 60 lb of iron and a dinished piece
10:31:30 <skram> Do they not have steel on the sword coast
10:37:25 -!- Dot` [~quassel@94.3.39.48] has joined #tlponies
