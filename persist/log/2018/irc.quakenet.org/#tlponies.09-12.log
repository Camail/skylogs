00:35:49 <BioSC> WOAH
00:35:54 <BioSC> that seems less than ideal
00:38:22 <Phearlock> Depends on how lewd the rpg is supposed to be
01:54:46 <Dot`> why you still awake skram

23:16:39 <Phearlock_> I love divos 2 combat.
23:17:00 <Phearlock_> Just did a usually hard fight super easily by dividing the enemy forces with a dressing panel.
23:17:07 <Phearlock_> placed in a doorway
23:17:12 <Camail> >_>
23:17:24 <Phearlock_> They did attack it to try break through it
23:17:30 <Phearlock_> but it took them 2 turns
23:18:19 <Camail> if you prepare pre-combat, most of the fights are simplified
23:18:35 <Camail> but if you just run around as a group of 4 prepare to be AOE'd yo death
23:18:53 <Phearlock_> Yeah that's how it works =D
23:19:49 <Camail> i walked into the final confrontation, got my ass blassted as they did 10k damage to my entire party
23:19:52 <Camail> then i quit for the night
23:20:25 <Camail> but my dwarf is strong as hell so i'm sure he'll do fine if he manges to live to his turn
23:20:44 <Phearlock_> that final fight was terrifying when I did it on honor mode
23:21:00 <Phearlock_> Almost went horribly but some camping saved the day
23:21:18 <Phearlock_> Just regular tactician this time though so when I eventually get to it I'm not really worried =P
23:21:59 <Camail> i've done a little bit of positional play throughout the game but cheesy wins have been the least satisfying experience
23:22:16 <Camail> i like winning inside the box, outside the box is too easy
23:23:01 <Camail> also some of my gear is lvl 15
23:23:18 <Camail> but i refuse to give up on that +1 warfare
23:23:38 <Phearlock_> Pre positioning to avoid silly AOE is required. But otherwise I enjoy doing most of the fights fairly.
23:24:16 <Phearlock_> And I have no qualms about repositioning to a really good spot once the fight is going.
23:24:43 <Phearlock_> My favorite fight in the game is the big oil field platform.
23:25:03 <Camail> my second playthrough vs sallow man i cheesed the hell out of it by accident and didnt feel like redoing it because the fight was never a challenge anyway
23:25:13 <Camail> yea phear, both times i did it i was a huge fan
23:25:34 <Camail> turns out you can talk to sallow man and aggro everyone else and kill them before he goes aggro
23:25:42 <Phearlock_> lol
23:25:50 <Phearlock_> Never did that, but sounds hilarious
23:25:58 <Camail> i found a lot of fucky things you can manipulate with characters in dialog
23:26:03 <Camail> like how time stops for them
23:26:21 <Camail> so you can buff them with everything, then wait for the cooldowns to run out, thne start the fight
23:26:39 <Phearlock_> Yeah
23:26:57 <Phearlock_> I usually only use the talks to do pre fight positioning if I forgot to do it beforehand.
23:27:19 <Phearlock_> Oh and for pickpocketing
23:27:23 <Phearlock_> Very important
23:27:28 <Phearlock_> Steal everyones skillbooks
23:27:38 <Phearlock_> my skills now
23:28:08 <Camail> yea, tho i never had money issues, just sitting with 150k and nothing else i care to spend it on
23:28:20 <Camail> i should probably shop around and actually get good armor?
23:28:49 <Phearlock_> Yeah especially at the end I try to shop around for good stuff
23:28:54 <Camail> i DID do one really scummy thing by making all my mercenaries kiss the spider
23:29:13 <Camail> 1 AP res scrolls are good
23:29:22 <Phearlock_> =D
23:30:06 <Phearlock_> And yeah you get so much money in this game.
23:30:12 <Phearlock_> I try to get even more money though
23:30:34 <Phearlock_> Usually have some + barter gear
23:30:36 <Camail> i ddi that my first run, but i didnt respect for theivery in the second run
23:30:51 <Phearlock_> bribe some guy to 100 reputation and then sell him everything
23:30:53 <Camail> i hate the portraits you get when your espec so i haven't done that with any of my characters
23:32:04 <Phearlock_> I wonder if they changed loremastery at all.
23:32:21 <Phearlock_> It was pretty useless before as it was easy enoguh to just find a store who could do it and pay them
23:32:24 <Phearlock_> As it was pennies really
23:32:52 <Camail> i just made fane do it
23:33:04 <Camail> i would never want to go back to town just to do that
23:33:23 <Camail> i'd identify inside the chest
