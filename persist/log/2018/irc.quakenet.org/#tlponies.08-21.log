15:34:43 <skram> what were the other optionms
15:34:53 <skram> well obviously we're going there at some point regardless
15:35:24 <Dot> AMRC, the people i met them through and was going to do a degree apprenciship with
15:35:35 <Dot> its still an option, but they seem least keen on that
15:36:03 <Dot> there is a far more relevant degree apprenticeship at sheffield hallam they could get me into
15:36:16 <Dot> or i take a trainee position there 
15:36:40 <Dot> and then next year can if i want start an apprenticeship or some other studies

15:37:36 <Dot> gl bio
15:38:30 <Dot> I am leaning to trainee though skram, it gets me into engineering, gives me more options
15:39:48 <skram> Like the on at cougar?
