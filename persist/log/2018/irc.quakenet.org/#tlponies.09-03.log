18:59:23 <Dot> Runbun was right then
18:59:46 <skrm> Its a solid guess
19:00:08 <skrm> Have not left it in quite a few years, barring a few beer runs to sweden obviously
19:01:27 <Zounds> Come visit UK
19:01:56 <Zounds> We have tea and hedgerows
19:02:56 <skrm> Some day I will, Zounds 
19:03:56 <skrm> Then you'll join me for one of those whisky tours on islay, right?
19:09:16 <Zounds> There are so many whisky tours everywhere
19:09:34 <Zounds> You can do islay yourself since I'm lazy
19:09:44 <DuB`> Haha
19:11:51 <Zounds> I'll join you for glengoyne since I don't need to get on a ferry to reach it
19:12:03 <Camail> DuB`  its really weird replaying divinity 2 and going from dealing 900 damage to doing 7
19:12:17 <skrm> Ferries are the best part of any tour, Zounds 
19:12:28 <Camail> i prefer fairies
19:12:50 <skrm> Thats because you're a pervert
19:13:06 <Zounds> ferrys are rubbish
19:13:18 <Zounds> the places they take you are often good though
19:13:20 <DuB`> lol Camail
19:13:39 <skrm> I thought we was frens, Zounds 
19:13:39 <Camail> they lowered the power gap in definitive edition
19:13:56 <Camail> so being 2 levels below an enemy is no longer 100% death
19:14:00 <DuB`> In Div1 my strat was to have two tanks just stand in a doorway and then have the rest of my team as mages and just stack AoEs on the other side
19:14:04 <DuB`> Kills things gud
19:14:25 <Camail> there's not a lot of doorways in this game
19:14:27 <Zounds> If me not enjoying ferrys is a deal breaker skrm then it was never meant to be
19:14:34 <Camail> this run i'm going as hard on stuns as possible
19:16:17 <skrm> My hearts breaking Zounds 
19:16:28 <Camail> if you can do damage AND make them skip their turn, there's nothing more efficient, it's great
19:17:50 <skrm> Are you set for the raid thing on wednesday Zounds 
19:18:20 <Zounds> yeh but I think im raiding on sunday
19:18:25 <Zounds> maybe wednesday but prob sunday
19:18:55 <skrm> cool cool
19:19:29 <Zounds> I have my flasks, my feasts and some augment runes
19:19:46 <Zounds> 342 ilevel with good stats
19:19:56 <skrm> right, thats a thing i need to do as well¬®
19:20:05 <skrm> im on 339
19:20:06 <Zounds> likely gonna blow through normal I think
19:20:21 <skrm> is hc open first day?
19:20:28 <Zounds> I think so?
19:20:37 <skrm> might as well start there then
19:21:09 <Zounds> Suppose we could
19:27:23 <Zounds> I'll just go where I'm told since I have no initiative and just want to blast things with mind melting shadow magicks
