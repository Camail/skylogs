20:19:02 <Zounds> you got "may play" and "may do" mixed up in the ol' brainosphere
20:20:27 <Cane> Damnedest thing.
20:26:57 <Camail> welp, time to farm
20:31:30 <DuB`> Rialto is nice, it just feels kinda squashed though
20:31:49 <DuB`> First point is way front-heavy and last point is just... not much at all
20:49:55 <Camail> so starcases dont stack
20:50:02 <Camail> so you cant  rush to 100
20:50:15 <Camail> also we should get our backpack upgrades at this point
21:09:42 <DuB`> Man
21:09:57 <DuB`> How do you look good against NYXL (!!) and then show up like bots against london 
21:10:01 <DuB`> Dragons...
