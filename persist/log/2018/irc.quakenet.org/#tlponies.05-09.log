00:13:45 <DuB`> Hehehe
00:13:54 <DuB`> Kero kero bonito is fun
00:14:13 <Bio> i just ignore the anime speak

00:14:45 <DuB`> ebi tabeyo, pink iro ni naru yo!
00:20:40 <Camail> Phearlock  is there a save file transfer thing for pillars one to two
00:21:59 <Phearlock> There seems to be though it didn't seem to work instantly (might be cause one is on GoG and the other is on steam for me). Otherwise, there is an in-depth "what you did in the previous save" generator in the options.
00:22:17 <Phearlock> I used the latter
00:23:13 <Camail> is it after the intro stuff
00:23:53 <Phearlock> Only accessible from the main menu as far as I can tell
00:24:04 <Phearlock> options, "set PoE1 Game stats"
00:24:37 <Phearlock> lets you create a profile with the different choices for major quests and characters and name it, then it's selectable during the intro
00:25:52 <Camail> cool, thnaks
00:26:29 <Camail> i think my second play through let the gilded vale get fucked up
00:26:32 <Camail> because i forgot...
00:26:39 <Camail> well, oh well that town sucked anyway
00:26:59 <Phearlock> I had to look some stuff up
00:27:14 <Phearlock> As it used a lot of just character names for quests and I'm like "wait who was that again?"
00:33:10 <Phearlock> I also swapped classes as I wanted to try the new multiclass thing
00:33:34 <Phearlock> I enjoyed those back in the baldurs gate days =P
00:36:16 <Camail> yea it looks like there's no save transfer, just gotta make it
00:38:10 <Camail> LUL the leaden key question
00:38:15 <Camail> I was very, very violent
00:38:26 <Camail> everyone went squish under my fists
00:38:50 <Phearlock> Yeeeeeah there may have been murder involved
00:38:53 <Phearlock> a lot of murder
00:45:35 <Camail> i cant unhear ashley as the narrator
00:46:04 <DuB`> Proud of this save: https://youtu.be/mcx35ynCOpU
00:46:05 <Camail> this might impact my enjoyment, maybe watching VAs play dnd is a bad call
00:48:38 <Phearlock> Not much I can do about that. Though so far the narrator hasn't been present that much once I got past the intro
00:51:42 <Camail> dub confirmed moira pro?
00:52:50 <Bio> confirmed press q to win
00:52:57 <Bio> =D
00:53:11 <DuB`> More like PRESS SHIFT ON REACTION TO EARTHSHATTER to win! :P
00:56:19 <Crisium> dub healing my dumb horse butt walking into dragon
00:56:32 <Bio> ITS SO SHINY THO
00:56:46 <DuB`> Shiny metal horsebutt is the best kind.
00:57:05 <Camail> ahaha, the "everything bad" option is a pretty solid option
00:59:58 <Phearlock> It was tempting but, not for the first playthrough xD
01:00:06 <Crisium> Fissure had 2 earth shatters in 6 seconds
01:00:06 <Crisium> https://clips.twitch.tv/SmilingConsiderateKittenTBTacoRight
01:00:23 <DuB`> Nobody better(tm)
01:00:39 <Crisium> https://clips.twitch.tv/BraveOpenStinkbugBleedPurple
01:01:13 <DuB`> Reinforce's reaction lolol
01:08:50 <Camail> i have a feeling there are gonna be some BROKEN multiclass synergies
01:09:11 <Phearlock> Oh for sure
01:09:16 <Camail> I'm going with monk that gets wounds form doing damage and cipher that gains focus from dealing damage
01:09:26 <Camail> i generate both resources from doing damage, so hopefully thats good
01:09:35 <Camail> but more importantly that sounds FUN
01:09:55 <Camail> and its actually a combination of both of my poe 1 playthroughs
01:10:03 <Phearlock> Going with the "boring" old mage + fighter combo. There's lots of spells I didn't really get to use last game as I didn't want my guy being all close and personal.
01:10:08 <Camail> so it's kinda lore-y like both my characters are in the same body
01:10:16 <Camail> battlemage is the best
01:10:24 <Phearlock> Going to get all dem close range and defensive buff spells.
01:10:31 <Camail> battlemage is my favorite thing in the world, as a concept
01:10:55 <Camail> I played that class in Sacred and have been in love with the hybrid style classes ever since
01:23:59 <DuB`> Shud I poe1?
01:24:01 <DuB`> $30
01:24:47 <Phearlock> You can probably get it cheaper. But I think it's a pretty great game.

01:44:27 <Camail> oh god i reached the choice phear, what do i do with this man
01:44:42 <Camail> I'm not on the highest difficulty, but I still think i need a damage sponge
01:45:50 <Phearlock> True dat

02:09:44 <Camail> holy shit I missed playing pillars so much
02:11:05 <Phearlock> Darn cozy game
02:11:56 <Phearlock> I like the details on the town map
02:12:18 <Phearlock> the text that is
02:15:23 <Phearlock> I'm eager to see how the boating is
02:15:38 <Phearlock> Should be getting to that in juuust a moment

04:42:23 <DuB`> I was considering using more, glad I didn't :P
04:42:29 <Dot`> and rather biol them too long than not long enough
04:42:33 <DuB`> Would just be curry-flavored mashed potatoes at that point haha

19:26:35 <DuB`> ??
19:26:56 <DuB`> The most difficult enemy we fought so far took... TWO hits to die :P
19:27:20 <skrm> You didnt notice? He was all arrrgh you take 9 damage and hnnng you attack your friends instead
19:27:33 <Phearlock> Skram is the most dangerous enemy yet
19:27:49 <DuB`> srs
19:27:50 <Phearlock> So much damage to party
19:28:11 <Bio> says the dwarf standing on dangerous crates swinging a greatswords at rats swarming all over a frail elf 
19:28:19 <Bio> who rolled a 1 then a 1/100 =P
19:28:56 <skrm> i was INNOCENT
19:29:12 <Phearlock> Focus on the past tense "was" is correct
19:29:23 <skrm> the elves framed me
19:29:26 <skrm> tricksy fucks
19:30:40 <DuB`> Innocent? Perhaps. Negligent? Surely.

19:36:04 <skrm> dot tell him
19:36:13 <carcinisation> responsible for injuring your friends?
19:36:31 <Dot`> skram, you need to calm down
19:37:21 <skrm> It was barely a flesh wound!
19:37:44 <Dot`> he diiiied

19:40:27 <Dot`> not mentaly
19:41:31 <Phearlock> the poor man broke his gun
19:41:38 <Phearlock> probably PTSD
19:43:54 <skrm> I had nothing to do with that

19:45:45 <Camail> i hope iots the same for stat bonuses too
19:46:05 <Camail> the overlapping stats in pillars 1 were always overly annoying to manage
19:47:16 <Phearlock> Oh they do? Sweet, not been playing enough to have found so much stuff I have to worry about that yet.
19:47:43 <Camail> my deflection bonus from ring + cape both stack
19:47:50 <Camail> so at least we know the resistances stack
19:54:07 <Phearlock> I have so many cats and dogs
19:54:08 <Phearlock> and 2 pigs

19:58:33 <Camail> wow
19:58:41 <Camail> -10 nerd points
19:58:52 <Camail> yea you 100% cannot play poe2 witohut playing the first
19:59:20 <Phearlock> I mean you can, but it REALLY is meant as a sequel

20:06:53 <Camail> it's a waste of a good reveal if you play po2 first
20:07:02 <Camail> seeing as the first cutscene basically spoils the ending
20:07:39 <Camail> also marisha plays one of the party members
20:07:57 <Camail> I need to not have this be a thing
20:08:08 <Camail> its so immersion shattering
20:14:15 <skrm> I think most of the CR people were involved in PoE?
20:15:00 <skrm> I swear there was a scene where liam and scanlan were doing fireside banter as bandits in that one castle to the east
20:18:41 <Camail> mercer was the only PC voice for eder and aloth
20:18:52 <Camail> but yea they've had good relationships for awhile
20:19:20 <Camail> but like...thats fine becase 1. i heard those voices before i knew him and 2. they dont sound too much like his resting voice
20:19:44 <Camail> but marisha's, even tho it fits, is close enough to where i literally just cant think about anything else when her character talks
20:33:47 <CockRoach|42> Dot`: where are doggos!
20:33:49 <CockRoach|42> _!
20:33:51 <CockRoach|42> ?!
