18:29:14 <Micen> 1.85 remaining
18:29:16 <Bio> git rekt
18:29:29 <DuB`> Let me type in the bytes by hand if you're gonna go that slow
18:29:45 <Micen> their servers are being hammered
18:30:18 <Runbunny> !!!!
18:30:33 <Runbunny> Hammer the servers!
18:30:37 <DuB`> So many skins
18:30:47 <DuB`> Good thing I have 16000 skins credits
18:30:48 <Runbunny> Skin farm when?
18:30:53 <Micen> dub i have an idea
18:30:53 <Bio> HAMMAH DOWN
18:31:02 <Micen> go talk to your brother and make a copy 
18:31:06 <Micen> he is in OW
18:31:12 <DuB`> He stole all the bytes >:T
18:31:14 <Micen> odds are it will go faster
18:32:10 <Zounds> Runbunny you don't play overwatch
18:32:14 <Zounds> why are you compelled to get the skins
18:32:37 <Runbunny> Zounds, all overwatch has going for it, is it's character design.
18:32:54 <Runbunny> and it's really good.
18:34:38 <Micen> im patched
18:34:40 <carcinisation> is there a skin list up anywhere yet?
18:34:45 <Zounds> That doesn't really explain much though Anders
18:34:58 <Zounds> you would be as well just looking at a picture of the skins
18:34:59 <Runbunny> Zounds...
18:35:18 <Runbunny> But I can have moving pictures ;)
18:36:25 <DoT|Phone> gifs
18:36:55 <Runbunny> Also there's a really cute mercy skin from like last year, that i didn't get.
18:37:29 <Zounds> This year I'm after the Reaper and Pajaemei
18:37:29 <carcinisation> runbun wants to *be* the cute girl
18:37:46 <Zounds> The rest I can take or leave
18:37:57 <Zounds> Unless there's some I haven't seen
18:39:41 <DuB`> Hanzo??

23:47:12 <Zounds> That wraith form feels so good
23:48:52 <Dot`> cr https://imgur.com/gallery/aSYWW
23:49:01 <skram> Reyes is DEAD, Zounds
23:49:12 <Dot`> i thought skram was dead

23:49:22 <skram> I was for like 7 hours Dot`
23:49:40 <Zounds> I got the event skins so he's infact Soldier24
23:49:59 <DuB`> I only have winston and doomfist skins... -.-;
23:50:02 <DuB`> The worst ones
23:50:08 <DuB`> Neither should be a legendary!
23:50:17 <Zounds> That winston one is so bad :p
23:50:40 <Zounds> It looks different enough from the default to be a legendary
23:50:55 <Zounds> but it looks terrible
23:51:01 <DuB`> Different backpack, some wires on his head
23:51:03 <DuB`> That's it.
23:51:09 <Zounds> different chestplates and gloves too
23:51:12 <Zounds> pretty much all different
23:51:26 <DuB`> Hard to notice those and same color as default skin thoooo
23:51:33 <Dot`> glad you got better skram
23:51:36 <Zounds> yeah
