00:57:51 <DuB`> Nuffin
00:58:06 <DuB`> Trying to decide between chill warframe+streams or OW arcade wins
00:58:46 <skram> what a boat skool
00:59:07 <DuB`> I did lots
01:03:45 <reification> gj dub

01:04:28 <DuB`>  Oh good, LAG picking up an actual good tank haha
01:04:31 <DuB`> nn reef
01:06:09 <Camail> just finished my first ascension 1 ironclad run, you can really feel when build is gonna win
01:06:32 <Camail> now time for the actual hard stuff to begin
01:07:28 <DuB`> .choose OW WF
01:07:31 <DuB`> Oho
01:40:15 <skram> Bio i got a legendary item in a random dungeon
01:40:20 <skram> is this a thing that happens now?
01:42:35 <Micen> you can get legos mostly anywhere
01:43:30 <Micen> any loot has a miniscule chance of dropping, slightly higher in dungeons/pvp boxes, more in m+, more in raids

02:47:36 <DuB`> yusss
02:55:37 <Crisium> planet arium
03:20:20 <Camail> BioSC  so i just happened to look at the slay the spire log file and one of the things they check is if a current run is saved and exists
03:20:31 <Camail> one info level log for ironclad, silent
03:20:33 <Camail> and...robot
03:23:08 <Camail> so maybe the third character is a robot, dont know why they would check fr save files for a red herring unless they specifically made it that debugging log to fuck with ppl
03:24:02 <Camail> hmmm, maybe it is a placeholder
03:24:54 <Camail> ohhhhhh
03:25:05 <Camail> it WAS a character
03:25:15 <Camail> but a beta dead character. mystery solved

22:59:17 <skram> looks promising already
23:00:13 <Bio> small, kinda smelly, slightly rude
23:00:16 <Bio> xD
23:00:22 <Dot`> only slightly?

23:01:25 <DuB`> https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7xkfrx/developer_update_ptr_hero_changes_overwatch/
23:01:42 <DuB`> Big mei buff, sombra -> way more dps, less ult
23:01:55 <DuB`> And POTENTIAL REMOVAL OF SCATTER ARROW
23:01:57 <DuB`> WAAAHAHAHAHA
23:02:44 <DuB`> pportunist (wallhacks on low health targets)
23:02:44 <DuB`> Now activates when enemies‚Äô health bars are at less than 100%, up from 50% health
23:02:57 <DuB`> Who needs widow wallhacks anymore...
23:03:08 <Zounds> Doesn't it only apply to sombra though?
23:03:27 <skram> that sounds like a fun vortex
23:03:47 <DuB`> Yeah, but if you're stacking or communicating...
23:03:51 <DuB`> No more sneaky sneaky 
23:04:30 <skram> stealth heroes in general are fun vortexes honestly
23:04:36 <skram> or snipers...
23:05:06 <Zounds> Meh I never minded sombra much so far
23:05:26 <DuB`> She'll be a crazy assassin now
23:05:30 <Zounds> Cane: any opinion on the Sombra changes?
23:05:38 <DuB`> RIP supports forever
23:06:27 <Zounds> The reduced spread does sound good
23:06:39 <Zounds> One of the reasons I don't play sombra is how much that weapon sprays :p
23:09:28 <Zounds> I wonder if those new hanzo arrows will be full damage
23:09:34 <Zounds> could be OG fan the hammer all over again
23:10:43 <Zounds> I'm ready to shootmans again dub
23:11:10 <Zounds> Or assist in the shootmanning via heals or tanking more likely

23:17:47 <carcinisation> i'll play a few, give me some minutes
23:18:34 <skram> Let me finish my dinner
23:18:38 <skram> Gimme like 15 minutes
23:27:59 <Dot`> did you like the dorf lore skram
23:29:05 <Cane> Zounds, I haven't played with them yet but I like them a lot.
23:29:24 <Cane> The main problem Sombra has in team fights is that her hack is still slow and easy to interrupt.
23:29:35 <Cane> So she's basically just an ult battery in most cases.
23:30:08 <Cane> This is an interesting direction to take, where she's more of a backline support/debuff instead of an odd support healer with ult.
23:31:17 <Cane> It's definitely a buff to Sombra, not just a change.
23:35:47 <Dot`> Dub https://imgur.com/gallery/HFDMx
23:43:24 <Cane> The only completely nonsense change is Opportunist.
23:43:28 <Cane> She basically has wallhacks.
