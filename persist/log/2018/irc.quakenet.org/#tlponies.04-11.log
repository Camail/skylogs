08:13:16 <Dot`> Morning all
08:18:18 <Camail> dort
08:18:40 <Dot`> cam, why you awake
08:18:45 <Camail> i played csgo soloq and it wasnt terrible
08:18:46 <Camail> that is why
08:19:05 <Camail> it went to OT so the adrenaline still hasnt fully worn off
08:19:06 <Dot`> sounds dangerous
08:19:11 <Camail> it was on faceit
08:19:20 <Camail> which is what the tlp stack will 100% use
08:19:28 <Camail> because its essentially casual 5v5
08:19:35 <Camail> free unranked 5v5
08:20:51 <Camail> I'll make a faceit account for my smurf so there's no mmr skew, but that's faaar into the future
08:22:56 <Dot`> i will try CSGO again at some point
08:23:22 <Camail> its honestly less stressful than OW because you cant be directly responsible for the teams failure
08:26:41 <Dot`> but i still need to practice my hoof fights
08:33:07 <Camail> the barrier of entry is lower in csgo
08:34:55 <Camail> tho i'm like 99% sure everyone stopped playing tfh
08:35:28 <Camail> anime fighters are hard, especially when you dont know to look for
08:37:37 <Phearlock> Still having fun with TFH actually. Still bad though =D
08:42:01 <Phearlock> Have learned I can fly, have learned there are things flying is very unsafe against.
08:42:12 <Phearlock> Have learned Pom jc is bullshit but that's ok.
08:42:34 <Phearlock> still don't know how to stop inputting the wrong thing at least 2 times a match.
08:42:37 <Phearlock> =D
08:43:44 <Phearlock> Still not sure quite how to reliably execute my own jcs crossup properties.
08:44:07 <Phearlock> But there's always "fly above them 2D lol such high tier crossup"
08:45:34 <Camail> pom has a few dirty set ups, yea
08:45:41 <Camail> but you have to expect that from a puppet character
08:45:44 <Phearlock> hoof fites good game
08:46:17 <Camail> messing up inputs is fine, you aren't grinding tech in the lab for hours a day
08:46:45 <Phearlock> No but there's still like "shit I did not want to launcher there".
08:46:45 <Camail> and that's pretty much what you gotta do if you ever want to hit the level of consistency in technical stuff
08:46:53 <Camail> but once you get there it sticks with you for any game
08:47:18 <Camail> its all the same, really
08:47:37 <Phearlock> Right now trying to grind out one of the actual decent combos. As from what I've seen most of tians combos actually all end the same way.
08:47:38 <Camail> it gets complicated when you are trying to fix that problem
08:48:06 <Phearlock> But wow hey who knew close-to-optimal combos were hard?!
08:48:15 <Camail> ideally you try to find a combo that ends with you on offense
08:49:05 <Phearlock> Kinda all of tians stuff ends with hard knockdown in the corner even if you start on the other side of the stage.
08:49:16 <Phearlock> That's nice at least, not much corner specific stuff outside of super2
08:49:31 <Camail> my only issue with the game is that there's only one ender for set ups for any given character
08:49:41 <Camail> the combo system is really boring compared to skullgirls
08:50:48 <Phearlock> I don't have anything to compare to right now. So that''s ok =P
08:51:03 <Camail> sg is TOO free
08:51:15 <Camail> like defense is miserable in that game
08:51:29 <Camail> defense is fine in tfh
08:51:33 <Phearlock> I should try that sometime
08:51:40 <Phearlock> but eh learning 2 things
08:52:29 <Camail> defense is pretty important, its the difference between winning a single game and never ever winning
08:52:47 <Camail> you dont even need to know really good combos
08:53:00 <Phearlock> I still really suck at defense haha.
08:53:09 <Phearlock> But sometimes it works out
08:53:30 <Camail> yea because you need to know the other characters' offense
08:53:39 <Camail> there are some important fundamentals, too
08:54:00 <Camail> like pushblock, chicken block, blocking in general
08:54:27 <Phearlock> Not heard chicken block yet.
08:54:42 <Phearlock> What's that?
08:54:56 <Camail> holding up back
08:55:19 <Camail> when you are in the air you can more easily block stuff
08:56:28 <Phearlock> Makes sense. Another cute term down.
09:03:26 <Camail> the most important thing is probably to learn to block, then pushblock on reaction
09:03:52 <Camail> like it will solve a vast majority of your problems, because without pushblock, people just get to keep attacking for free
09:04:33 <Camail> but that means that you should be blocking in neutral a lot
09:04:57 <Phearlock> Yeah right now pushblock is still a pretty delayed thing.
09:05:34 <Phearlock> needs to be way faster =P
09:05:48 <Camail> there are only two reasons to not be blocking while in neutral, you are doing a forward movement, or an attack
09:06:07 <Camail> once the blocking part becomes automatic and you are playing safely, you free up brain space to react with pushblock
09:06:39 <Phearlock> That is how it works. So many things to juggle in your head at once.
09:13:40 <Camail> also in neutral you probably want to know what your best angles of approach are
09:14:08 <Camail> you have so much air mobility you pretty much get to choose, which means you choose the best angle for your air normal
09:14:28 <Camail> tho ant airs are on the zoners are nuts

19:40:04 <Dot> but sure, this weekend probably
19:40:15 <Zounds> aight
19:40:18 <Dot> dnd friday, and work tomorow 
19:42:03 <skram> whats tooth and tail
19:42:10 <skram> is it the new hot thing
19:42:52 <Zounds> no
19:43:05 <Zounds> but dotties just got it in humble bundle
19:43:12 <Zounds> and I already had it and its quite fun
19:43:16 <Zounds> but nohorse plays it
19:43:25 <Dot> cute communist animals killing eachother
19:44:02 <Zounds> It's a small scale fast paced RTS
19:44:16 <Zounds> Where you control a dude and he pretty much acts as your cursor
19:44:29 <Zounds> SO you run around building stuff and scouting and directing troops like that
19:50:19 <Phearlock> speaking of games, been terrible about asking, anyone for hoof-fites sometime?
19:51:47 <Zounds> Did you ever make a race of friendship loving ponies in stellaris phear?
19:52:03 <Phearlock> There is a pony mod
19:52:15 <Phearlock> So you can totally do exactly that if you want to.
19:53:15 <Zounds> Imagine trekking through space and being hailed by Celestia
19:53:18 <Zounds> that'd be pretty neat

19:53:32 <Phearlock> Lately my favorite has been playing as hive mind empires
19:54:31 <Phearlock> you take some restrictions on what you can do diplomacy and population wise. But don't have to worry about happiness at all.
19:56:06 <Phearlock> Also kinda lucky last game as my hostile neighbor had an ancient ruined Dyson Sphere in his territory, which he eventually ceded to me after a few conflicts (that he started).
19:56:39 <Zounds> Watch out for heroic protoss channeling the khala at your hive mind in a heroic sacrifice
19:56:42 <Phearlock> So was able to get it up and running again in the late-midgame, which is quite a bit earlier than usual. Solving most energy problems.
19:57:03 <Phearlock> hmm, good point.
