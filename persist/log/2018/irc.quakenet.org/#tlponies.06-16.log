19:11:14 <Crisium> gg
19:27:22 <Runbunny> Oh apparently Quake is free if you download it and play one match. I thought it was only for a week of playing.
19:46:35 <CrisPone> Rly?
19:53:24 <Runbunny> yeah
19:53:32 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
19:54:10 <Runbunny> But you have to unlock champions. Which are like 250000 green coins each
19:54:27 <Runbunny> and you get roughly 500-700 per match.
19:55:30 <Runbunny> So you only have to grind like 500 matches to unlock one.
19:56:17 <Runbunny> or roughly 208 hours per champion unlock. 
19:56:32 <Runbunny> More likely more since there is downtime between matches.
