00:12:01 <Camail> for days
00:12:18 <skram> looks great dub
00:12:46 <DuB`> None left beef lolol
00:13:07 <Camail> it's easily my favorite thing
00:13:15 <Camail> its pre-meme and i love it for that
00:13:30 <Camail> early viral stuff is so genuine
00:14:15 <Camail> it's much more systematic now that we have extremely well established social sites
00:14:31 <Camail> rather than 100000 forums scattered in the wind
00:14:55 <Camail> god, pear cider is so delicious
00:15:04 <skram> What was the first meme that was called a meme do you think
00:15:46 <skram> I know the dancing baby thing and the all your base are considered to be but it wasnt called that until some point later
00:15:55 <Camail> hmmm, probably a mem with the words dank meme in it
00:16:14 <Camail> the runescape guy with the hat is where i first saw it
00:16:41 <Camail> http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gnome-child
00:16:51 <Camail> somewhere around when this started, is my guess
00:18:14 <Camail> the term "viral video" was what everyone called memes for quite a few years
00:18:43 <skram> yeah
00:19:28 <Camail> but we needed a term to also include "image macros"
00:19:40 <Camail> like rage comics, which i think are memes
00:20:07 <Camail> dub are you old enough to remember newgrounds memes
00:20:37 <DuB`> Naw
00:20:49 <DuB`> Our family got our first decent PC pretty late too
00:20:56 <Phearlock> I think I remember some
00:21:06 <Phearlock> wow newgrounds, that was a while ago
00:21:26 <skram> friggin flash animation meems
00:21:32 <skram> albinoblacksheep
00:21:32 <Phearlock> Still a bit miffed Super Mario Bros Z never finished.
00:21:35 <Phearlock> That was pretty gud
00:21:52 <Phearlock> And the closest I will get to watching DBZ
00:22:26 <Camail> newgrounds is so important to internet culture today
00:22:40 <Camail> like god damn, so many animators and personalities wouldnt exist
00:23:30 <Camail> the brackenwood series is STILL a thing
00:23:36 <Camail> after like 15 years?
00:23:48 <Phearlock> wow really?
00:23:56 <Phearlock> I remember watching the first few of those
00:23:59 <Camail> https://bitey.com/
00:24:04 <Phearlock> cool
00:24:09 <Camail> i dont think it's super productive but he's still active
00:24:29 <Camail> that guy used to FILL the top rated animations of all time
00:24:34 <skram> the site even looks ancient
00:24:55 <Camail> yea, it runs deep into the archives of th einternet
00:25:33 <Camail> i loved his fbf animation, in a world of tweens he truly stood out

00:44:06 <Camail> I want metatron to be more popular
00:44:12 <Camail> like, no one fucking knows about metatra
00:44:16 <Zounds> What did you think of the angels in dark souls 3 dlc cam
00:44:25 <Zounds> Those guys were cool looking
00:44:28 <Zounds> freaky though
00:44:31 <Camail> it was cool, gross but cool
00:44:43 <Camail> i like how they were ascended pilgrims
00:44:57 <Camail> but you also saw angels in the base game when you were in lothric castle
00:45:03 <Camail> they were all skeletal and flying
00:45:22 <Zounds> yeah
00:45:27 <Zounds> I didn't know what they were at the time
00:45:52 <Camail> i recognized them as the trees we saw earlier but never thought they would transform even further

00:47:44 <Camail> i fucking googled "biblical metatron"
00:47:52 <Camail> and i get this as the 4th result
00:48:15 <Camail> https://goo.gl/hTZpjE
00:48:21 <Camail> why
00:49:56 <Zounds> Everything has to be ponified
00:50:00 <Zounds> grim work but it has to be done
00:57:20 <Camail> is  everyone excited for david cage's new masterpiece movie
00:57:26 <Camail> i mean, game
00:58:43 <Zounds> It was dumb but I didn't hate beyond two souls
00:59:34 <Zounds> So excited isn't the right word but if it's ever free on PS+ I might play it >.<
01:01:30 <Camail> i like the part where they force your main character to love a douchebag
01:02:21 <Zounds> That is quite realistic!
01:03:23 <Camail> or when they randomly introduce world destroying threats in the last hour of the game
01:03:31 <Camail> or the dust ghost
01:03:40 <Camail> good acting tho
01:03:46 <Camail> because good actors
01:03:52 <Zounds> Yeah
01:03:56 <Zounds> If you want iredeemable
01:03:58 <Zounds> Look at Heavy Rain
01:04:01 <Zounds> sweet jesus
01:04:37 <Zounds> So many red herrings thrown around in that game
01:04:40 <Camail> SEAN
01:04:52 <Zounds> It's trying to be clever in the reveal but it just fails
01:04:59 <Zounds> JASON
01:05:30 <Zounds> I also like how one of the mechanics in the game is hearing your characters inner thoughts
01:05:55 <Zounds> Yet you play as the killer and pretty much nothing tips you off that things aint right
01:06:17 <Bio> poen
01:06:20 <Camail> david cage isn't even his real name
01:06:31 <Camail> its a name he invented, to be cool
01:06:36 <Camail> he is so fucking fake
01:06:40 <Zounds> David is the coolest name after all
01:07:00 <Camail> he just change his last name

01:20:36 <Camail> apparently the sexual assault allegation on george tekai were greatly exaggerated
01:21:35 <Camail> it's basically the same situation as that aziz ansari was in
01:22:05 <Camail> actor wants to fuck person, it gets awkward, then they both stop and nothing happens
01:36:45 <Crisium> Camail https://en.shindanmaker.com/759543
01:37:01 <Crisium> Crisium is a braindead character with a setplay playstyle in the next poverty fighting game. His trait is an instant killing super thanks to a crystal ball 
01:38:06 <Camail> memes
01:38:22 <Camail> butts is a top tier character with a rushdown playstyle in the next Guilty Gear. His trait is a two button DP thanks to ice abilities
01:38:27 <Camail> I'd play butts
01:38:43 <Camail> two button DPs are basically broken if no one else has them
01:40:12 <DuB`> DuB` is apparently an overrated yugioh character crossed over into soul calibur.
01:40:15 <DuB`> Yuck
01:41:30 <Camail> DuB` is a overrated character with a keepaway playstyle in the next Soulcalibur. Its trait is an instant killing super thanks to the heart of the cards

02:15:31 <Camail> the generated character for Crisium
02:15:40 <Crisium> lol
02:15:57 <Camail> she never spends meter so she reversal supers (cuz no other invincible reversal)
02:16:05 <Camail> she has an orb as her primary way of attacking
02:16:21 <Camail> her v trigger is basically free mix ups for set play
02:16:30 <Camail>  and day 1 menat was braind dead
02:16:39 <Camail> she's suuuuper not brain dead anymore tho
02:16:57 <Crisium> that cat costume tho
02:17:50 <Camail> her costumes are pretty good

16:29:11 <DuB`> Watching that makes me realize how it's possible that Monaco had literally 0 overtakes during the race in 2003
16:29:14 <DuB`> lol
16:29:29 <DuB`> Sooo narrow
16:30:06 <Cane> It is one of my favorite tracks in sims for that reason, but bloody hell it's hard to have a clean overtake.
16:31:17 <Cane> I watched Formula 2 the other day on this track.
16:31:24 <Cane> Different beast entirely. So much drama and wallsmashing.
16:31:40 <skram> Yeah monaco is pretty great

18:06:07 <Camail> on top of the usual attempts to install shitty AV software, it opened my browsers and installed an add on
18:06:13 <Camail> that's a new level of invasive
18:06:39 <skram> Is this a new tactic for punishing torrenting
18:06:47 <skram> because it sounds way more effective
18:06:57 <DuB`> I bet the GOVERNMENT sponsored that!

18:12:18 <Camail> it's really not that hard to get rid of, chrome even pops up a window
18:12:30 <Camail> "he this add on was installed in a weird way, you wanna instantly delete it?"

18:22:26 <Phearlock> hahaha
18:22:48 <DuB`> "Hey harry, there's some dust on your jacket, lemme get that"
18:22:49 <DuB`> SCHWING
18:26:01 <skram> Fnatic is doing it I think
18:27:51 <DuB`> Doto?
18:27:58 <skram> Maybe not D:
18:28:00 <skram> Yeah DuB`
18:28:05 <skram> ESL
18:28:10 <DuB`> Ye I am watch
18:31:18 <DuB`> I've watched like 4-5 spectre games in the last couple of weeks and don't think I've seen a win.
18:31:20 <DuB`> lol
18:31:33 <skram> spectre is a bit of a gamble
18:32:21 <carcinisation> better off playing her in pubs where no-one can end fast
18:33:31 <Dot> i still have no idea whats happening in dota fights
18:33:35 <Dot> just flashy lights

18:38:48 <Bio> nope
18:38:55 <Bio> fnatic is anti doing it
18:39:18 <Bio> why they decided to sacrifice envy on a fuckin haaaard 1 pos specter is baffling
18:39:49 <Bio> literally had 0 damage thanks to enfeeble pretty much the entire laning phase
18:40:38 <Dot> no one had tree, bad game

18:41:15 <DuB`> Lina banned both games, no tree
18:41:21 <DuB`> Awfulest
18:41:38 <Bio> stronk heroes get bamned
18:42:03 <DuB`> Tree is too strong to be banned
18:45:15 <Camail> someone keeps trying to log into my epic games account
18:45:29 <Camail> some shitty kid doesn't know how to give up
18:46:16 <Camail> literally every day i get an email about someone trying to brute force the password
18:46:38 <DuB`> I had the same last month 
18:46:47 <DuB`> Dozen emails a week
18:47:50 <Camail> i dont understand why you would want to steal accounts
18:48:01 <Camail> nor why like...why try THIS method

18:48:30 <DuB`> My account has a whole TWITCH HAT on it!
18:49:40 <Camail> they will NEVER guess my password
18:49:57 <DuB`> correct horse battery staple
18:50:05 <Camail> brute forcing doesnt work on 12 character passwords
18:50:59 <Camail> passphrases aren't as airtight as they could be, considering dictionary attacks are a thing
18:51:42 <Camail> 2 factor authentication is ultimately the strongest security system you can have
18:51:50 <Bio> CORRECTHORSEBATTERYSTAPLE
18:55:42 <Bio> PLEASE MAKE UR WAY INTO BIOS HOUSE OF MAGIC AND FRIENDSHIP
18:55:50 <Bio> while i use the bafroom
18:58:20 <Camail> the best way to create a passphrase is to interrupt the words, either using some leet speak or putting a randomly chosen character after each first letter
18:58:46 <Camail> at that point it's virtually unbreakable
18:58:51 <Dot> skram
18:58:52 <Dot> pls
18:59:26 <skram> i have 1 and a half minutes left

21:40:26 <Runbunny> Golly, sell them ceiling mounted fax machines.
21:42:54 <Golly> whats that, a new cryptocurrency?
21:44:59 <Runbunny> No no, it's smart and innovative.
21:45:10 <Runbunny> Like fax machines takes up a lot of space.
21:45:26 <Runbunny> But if you mount them to the ceiling then the fax can just drop down.
21:45:58 <Golly> perhaps if the machines also turn them into paper airplanes....
21:46:02 <Golly> $$$$$
