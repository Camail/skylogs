00:00:04 <Bio> skram that vid was an adventure
00:01:09 <skram> guy has 10 million subs now lol
00:06:07 <Crisium> not looking good for GLA
00:06:09 <Crisium> end of times?
00:06:27 <skram> Gladiators, Los Angeles
00:06:45 <DuB`> Meh, 4-0 not likely anyway
00:06:59 <DuB`> LAV threw LAGs chances with their awful ilios yesterday :P
00:07:01 <Crisium> would you prefer LAG
00:07:08 <skram> yes
00:07:30 <Crisium> fite me
00:07:51 <Crisium> GLA is also short for GLAdiators
00:07:54 <skram> dont think i would win that :p
00:09:49 <DuB`> Surecreeee
00:10:38 <Crisium> so close!
00:10:41 <skram> 2cp
00:16:23 <Crisium> rip
00:16:50 <DuB`> Primal rage = 2cp gg
00:17:17 <Zounds> Sad!
00:18:13 <Crisium> The failing Gladiators are fake hype yet again.  Sad!
00:27:19 <Yolteotl> I'M WATCHIN PONY
00:28:00 <Zounds> hf
00:28:26 <Zounds> I shall watch it tomorrowz
00:28:29 <Zounds> or later I guess
00:28:39 <Zounds> since it is already tomorrow, today!
00:29:11 <DuB`> Does rank decay not happen for a week in diamond? Don't want to fall at all before I can push for masters on tuesday or whatever.
00:29:21 <DuB`> Gotta do test prep all weekend+monday now
00:29:31 <skram> 1 day plej = 1 day not decay
00:29:38 <skram> you can bank up to 5 or 6 days
00:29:45 <Zounds> 7 I think?
00:29:50 <skram> yeah maybe
00:30:40 <Zounds> You'll already have days banked after the placements so you've nothing to worry about
00:30:58 <Crisium> i will watch pony after the owl games over
00:32:22 <Zounds> I'm not sure if I'll push for masters or not this season
00:32:30 <Zounds> I suppose I will if the stack is doing comp
00:32:33 <Zounds> Since I must stack
00:33:01 <Crisium> im fine with stacking with my alt again
00:33:31 <Zounds> Comp games are way easier than quickplay at the moment
00:33:42 <Zounds> Maybe diamond if for plebs and I don't belong there
00:33:45 <Zounds> is*
00:34:37 <Crisium> comp games are easier
00:34:40 <Crisium> people actually try
00:34:44 <Crisium> thats why i prefer comp
00:35:21 <Crisium> you still get steamrolled sometimes of course, but overall its better

00:35:33 <Crisium> just gotta get over the tilting, toxic players :P
00:35:46 <DuB`> Being 4stack eliminates most of those.
00:35:48 <DuB`> Was nice
00:36:05 <Zounds> There was the one guy who muted chat after someone picked Hanzo
00:36:12 <Zounds> Ofc that's the game we lost since we had babby on the team
00:36:45 <skram> yeah that not a coincident :P
00:41:16 <Zounds> You would think after all this time folks would notice maybe Hanzo isn't that bad
00:41:42 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
00:44:33 <Zounds> If the guy is shit or having a bad day then sure ask him to swap but tilting the moment he's chosen is sooo 2 years ago
00:44:57 <Crisium> thats when you know you're playing on tilt
00:45:13 <Crisium> in my main account placements, we had 5 dps picked
00:45:22 <Crisium> i didnt say a word, and picked mercy and tried my best
00:45:24 <Crisium> we steam rolled them
00:45:34 <Crisium> its not worth freaking out over
00:46:08 <skram> yeah you're right
