03:06:25 <Bio> t
03:08:41 <Camail> yea me too, so i set my CR alarm to go of on tuesdays as well
03:08:48 <Camail> its honestly worth the watch most of the time
03:09:15 <Bio> yeh
03:09:21 <Bio> had travis and matt too
03:09:23 <Bio> rip
03:14:03 <Camail> i like the ones without matt more
03:14:12 <Camail> i like hearing what he has to say, but often he can't say much
03:14:51 <Camail> so when matts on, we get a lot of questions to him, but those could be questions to other people about the characters
03:15:18 <Camail> which almost always leads to more insight because they can't really spoil anything other than their backstories
03:15:43 <Camail> but i did enjoy when matt was talking about balancing openness and guidance of the dm
03:16:00 <Camail> because that was the main thing i learned from my campaign
03:16:35 <Camail> and seeing a bit behind the curtain on where he is on that balance is interesting

10:10:12 <Phearlock> I loved sins too. Though it's really different.

10:25:42 <Phearlock> (the answer is usually: find some reason to fuck up this other guy and take his shit. Or keep making friends)
10:28:54 <Dot> im an anti social sort

21:05:11 <Runbunny> Ahh Henrik. You grew up so fast.
21:05:28 <Camail> it's amazing how far 12 year olds can go in this world
21:05:35 <Camail> didn't even know child labor was still egla
21:05:38 <Camail> legal*
21:06:04 <Rawr|Phone> We are behind the times here in sweden
21:07:19 <Dot> or ahead, may we shall all return to using the untapped resources of child labour
21:09:24 <Camail> machines are slowly coming closer to having child intelligence 
21:09:36 <Camail> maybe one day we'll get back to the golden age
21:10:08 <Runbunny> Robotic child labor !
21:10:52 <Camail> runbun
21:12:19 <Camail> were you one of the ppl playing planetside 2
21:12:30 <Camail> i played a bit a few days ago
21:16:39 <Zounds> ps2 is 2x exp atm

21:20:23 <Zounds> how did it go Camail 
21:20:26 <Zounds> hi dub
21:21:12 <Camail> it was fun, i got wrecked at the beginning but as soon as i could get into building skirmishes it was pretty easy killing randos
21:21:24 <Camail> it's tough finding spots that aren't murder holes
21:21:46 <Camail> every time i would find one, people would slowly start going there and make it into a new murder hole
21:21:49 <Dot> hi dub
21:22:34 <Camail> also everyone has implants that are way better than mine
21:22:47 <DuB`> What's this? :o
21:22:52 <Zounds> implants don't really do much
21:23:03 <Camail> the steady aim thing seems pretty relevant
21:24:04 <Camail> getting into a 1v1 as heavy vs heavy is rough when they objectively have more control over their crosshair
21:24:39 <Zounds> Oh battle hardened?
21:25:10 <Camail> ya
21:25:29 <DuB`> wat gaaame
21:25:40 <Zounds> It's the most helpful of all to be fair
21:25:48 <Zounds> Though I don't use it myself these days
21:26:05 <Zounds> planetside 2 dub
21:26:09 <Dot> planatside dubs
21:26:14 <Zounds> assimilate can be good too
21:26:19 <Zounds> shield recharge on headshot kills
21:26:19 <DuB`> o i c
21:26:47 <Zounds> combined with the adrenaline shield on heavy and you can lawnmower tons of nublets
21:27:13 <Camail> yea the shield recharge one looked good too
21:28:53 <Zounds> Battle Hardened sounds better than it is though
21:29:01 <Zounds> flinch isn't very high nowadays in the first place in ps2
21:29:04 <Zounds> used to be much worse
21:29:41 <Camail> yea, I'm definitely coming from the cs perspective where as soon as you get tagged without armor you're basically dead, but i know it's not even close to that level of flinch
21:30:44 <Camail> but that just makes me more aware of how much flinch matters if you're trying to be good

21:31:26 <Zounds> technically i'm "good" at ps2 so take it from me :P

21:33:32 <Zounds> Runbuns not played much recently and I'm on and off depending on my mood
21:33:50 <Zounds> Usually haunting Hossin when it's almost empty because I love small fights
21:34:18 <DuB`> I like to shoot folks.
21:36:01 <Zounds> have you ever played a battlefield game Camail ?
21:36:17 <Zounds> there are a lot of transferable skills there
21:36:19 <Camail> i played bf2 and the new bf1 quite a bit
21:36:26 <Camail> but that was years ago
21:36:30 <Zounds> It's mostly like bad company 2
21:36:33 <Zounds> no prone etc
21:37:18 <Camail> i understand the game generally, and i played ps2 a decent amount a few years ago
21:38:00 <Zounds> Ah right you mentioned that before
21:38:12 <Zounds> Well the game is real newbie friendly now, even if it doesn't tell you

21:38:17 <Camail> i just dont think i can play it like how you described, I want to be part of the high impact fights, but that also involves murder holes
21:38:33 <Zounds> Yeah that makes sense :P I do go to big fights sometimes
21:38:34 <Camail> high pop is fun, but gets on my nerves with how repetative it can get
21:38:55 <Zounds> I'd go to them more but it murders my fps
21:39:31 <Zounds> not to an unplayable level unless it's a hellzerg but it's not ideal
21:40:58 <Zounds> What server where you on?
21:41:01 <Zounds> Connery I guess?
21:42:31 <Zounds> I think all the connery natives left in recent years and went to emerald
21:42:38 <Zounds> after the chinese lagwizards attacked
21:43:17 <Camail> lemme check
21:43:24 <Camail> just turned down all my settings
21:43:35 <Camail> I prefer when my FPSes look like garbage
21:44:16 <Zounds> If you don't mind not being able to see your bullets you could modify the .ini :P

21:44:30 <Zounds> fuck particles!
21:44:31 <Camail> tracers are kinda important
21:44:48 <Zounds> Yeh they are
21:44:52 <Zounds> not for infantry but for vehicles
21:45:20 <Camail> tracers help with spray control, which isn't as hard in this game but still, i like using them
21:45:36 <Camail> and yea i am on connery
21:45:49 <Camail> i have a red dude on emerald tho
21:46:20 <Zounds> Spray control is easy in planetside but it's also a bit unintuitive
21:46:34 <Zounds> outside of point blank range you want to burst 2-3 shots with most weapons really rapidly
21:46:47 <Zounds> bloom is quick but resets real quick too
21:47:31 <Runbunny> I only started playing earlier this year.
21:47:41 <Camail> how will i get 4 instant headshots if i can only do 3 shot bursts
21:47:46 <Camail> you're setting me up for failure
21:48:04 <Zounds> The 4th shot will be really soon after the 3rd
21:48:11 <Zounds> there will be a very small pause inbetween :P
21:48:16 <Camail> so will his!
21:48:23 <Zounds> He isn't important
21:48:29 <Zounds> He's some HHCN shitter
21:50:14 <Zounds> If you're playing Heavy that's a real good choice to learn the infantry game
21:50:20 <Zounds> I used to play heavy the most by far
21:50:32 <Zounds> I kinda burned out on it though and play LA and Medic all the time now
21:50:40 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
21:51:39 <Camail> i think i played medic a decent amount
21:51:51 <Camail> i just tried heavy for the day cuz it's what i was already equipped with
21:52:06 <Camail> occasionally changing to heal the sunderer
21:52:21 <Zounds> Wow you're already in the top 0.1 percentile of ps2 awareness
21:53:12 <Zounds> you'll be harvesting drone people with the best of them in no time
21:54:12 <Camail> its painfully easy to do, but most people just want to hold W
21:54:14 <Camail> like in all games
21:54:35 <Camail> or they like to hide behind a ridge and wait for tanks to break the line
21:54:43 <Camail> which was the most annoying thing
21:56:06 <Camail> dub wanna shoot people because they are a different color than you
21:58:47 <Zounds> oh it's gonna be 4x exp on friday for ps2 members
21:58:56 <Zounds> regular double exp weekend + the anniversary event
21:59:04 <Zounds> gonna be so cert rich!
21:59:10 <Zounds> if only I actually wanted to unlock anything
21:59:19 <DuB`> Can't right now, still hangin' out with familee
21:59:43 <Camail> i got a ton of messages about having certs refunded
21:59:54 <Camail> i assume things that i bought were changed or no longer exist or something
22:00:04 <Zounds> yeah they redid a lot of stuff over the years
22:00:24 <Zounds> nanoweave for example
22:00:39 <Zounds> first rank gives you full 20% damage reduction vs small arms now
22:00:58 <Zounds> the extra ranks give you the damage reduction to different weapon types
22:01:24 <Zounds> So in most cases you can get away with just 1pt in nanoweave for a long time 
22:01:55 <Zounds> Advanced shield capacitator got change too
22:02:06 <Zounds> I used to use that one for the reduced delay before shield recharge
22:02:11 <Zounds> now that's default
22:02:40 <Zounds> now it makes the shield charge faster but with the same delay
22:07:41 <Camail> hmm, i didnt have anything equipped
22:07:53 <Camail> i was taking a lot more damage than i should have
22:08:24 <Zounds> I'd suggest nanoweave these days
22:08:40 <Zounds> doesn't help vs headshots but it's the generally the best
22:10:16 <Zounds> flak armor is amazing in some situations though
22:10:25 <Zounds> explodey situations usually :P
22:12:43 <Camail> i think i want to get a weapon with the highest possible hip accuracy
22:12:54 <Camail> not having to right click always feels better for me
22:14:11 <Zounds> Orion + laser aint too bad
22:14:33 <Zounds> carbines tend to have the best hipfire stats though
22:16:51 <Zounds> though I'm assuming you're VS
22:16:57 <Camail> yea
22:17:08 <Camail> i mentioned in last time we talked about ps2 but that was months ago
22:17:15 <Zounds> aye
22:17:20 <Camail> made the account back when sc2 was still a thing
22:17:27 <Camail> and back when i play protoss
22:17:29 <Camail> so yea
22:17:31 <Zounds> the default carbine the solstice is good for hipfire
22:17:43 <Zounds> with a laser sight you can hipfire even at mid range
22:26:15 <Zounds> a general rule also is any gun that can take an advanced laser sight is pretty good for hipfire ^^

23:39:03 <Phearlock> My aliens are doing drugs
23:39:32 <Phearlock> out of the 4 science ship scientists I have employed so far in this stellaris game, 3 of them randomly rolled the substance abuse negative trait on levelup.
23:41:54 <Camail> fuck yea space cocaine
23:43:56 <Phearlock> no
23:44:00 <Phearlock> bad spacce cocaine
23:44:05 <Phearlock> D=
23:44:31 <Camail> 3 out of 4 scientists agree; space cocaine is great

23:49:57 <Camail> Runbunny  4 episodes into meglo box, it's good, maybe overhyped
23:50:07 <Camail> it's hella stylized tho
23:50:19 <Camail> feels like it was made 10 years ago
23:53:29 <Runbunny> Yeah, it looked very artistic from what I have seen.
23:53:42 <Runbunny> Definitely gives an Ippo feel.
