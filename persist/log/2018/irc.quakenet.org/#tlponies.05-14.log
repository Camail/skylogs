22:18:45 <Camail> playing more poe2
22:19:06 <Camail> because if my CRPGs aren't at least 100 hours i dont feel like I've played them enough, apparently
22:19:39 <Zounds> Well as long as you're still having fun there's no need to stop
22:20:18 <Zounds> I played Dark Souls for almost 500 hours and that was just doing the same thing slightly differently each time
22:23:33 <skram> what a nerd

22:41:45 <Camail> even tho i played with a full party, i can do another run of 5 other characters that are still different
22:42:10 <skram> fine cam
22:42:12 <skram> you convinced me
22:42:42 <Camail> i can't stop
22:47:16 <DuB`> Same
22:47:30 <DuB`> DLC 1&2 on DL now :P
22:47:43 <skram> I never did play the DLCs for poe1
22:48:14 <skram> do they matter enough for me to start an entirely new save in poe1 and play like 40 hours
22:48:18 <Dot`> i as playing old games skram, now i am in bed
22:49:48 <skram> i started a new book here the other day, ready player one
22:49:52 <skram> would recommend
22:50:16 <Dot`> there is a movie now, no nead to read the book obviosly
22:50:49 <skram> i know you well enough that i know you dont mean that
22:50:56 <Dot`> :P
22:52:09 <Camail> skram the DLC are endgame stuff, and they're really fun side stories that add to the world lore, it's a case of just more content, and if you want more content you get it
22:52:23 <skram> oh
22:52:26 <Camail> it all adds value to playing poe2 because there are a ton of call backs
22:53:01 <Camail> yea if you do the dlc and dont turn on level scaling act 3 is a fucking joooooke
22:53:32 <Camail> but if you have a save file already you can just hop into doing them
22:53:37 <skram> if i remember correctly you cant do them if you finished the main story so i'd have to start anew or pull up an old save or something
22:54:17 <skram> i think im just gonna jump into poe2 and revisit it if i still have the passion
22:54:23 <skram> i get disinterested pretty quick
22:57:52 <Camail> fair enough, I find it harder to recommend poe1 dlc when poe2 is out, and only $20 more
22:58:08 <Camail> it was easy as hell to recommend when that's all we had
22:58:45 <Camail> adds levels, new characters, further insight into the world, fun stuff
22:59:25 <skram> Yeah
22:59:32 <skram> poe1 was weird for me
22:59:41 <Camail> but then poe2 changes a few core mechanics, builds on the truths you find, and changes from a compeltely linear narrative to a narrative with a critical path and tons of exploration
22:59:57 <skram> I tried it a bunch of times and was kinda meh about it and then suddly found The Passion and played for probably 19 hours straight
23:00:49 <Camail> CRPGs are my jam, but i totally get how people can bounce off them
23:01:23 <Camail> the individual classes in poe2 are very similar to poe1, down the all of the abilities being pretty much the same
23:02:09 <Camail> but they added multiclassing and removed vancian spell limitations which change everything
23:13:37 <Camail> also they added in party assists with skill checks
23:20:17 <DuB`> Das good

23:40:49 <skram> good night phearlock, how are ya
23:40:56 <Phearlock> Pretty good
23:42:05 <Phearlock> the night has been very cozy indeed
23:51:22 <Camail> ok this pack of xaurips is murdering me
23:51:41 <Camail> i have like 20% chance to hit on everything
23:51:45 <Camail> this is rough
23:55:52 <Camail> ok now they interrupt a spell with a .3 second cast time god damn
23:56:07 <Camail> battlemage is terrible on the hardest difficulty unless you have like 2-3 concentration at all times
23:56:24 <Phearlock> lol sounds hard
23:59:41 <Camail> I'll have to take level restriction more seriously, just got hit by a 120 dmg crits so maybe I'm not supposed to be here
