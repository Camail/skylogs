18:13:36 <Bio> cause FUCK EU TIMEZONES AMIRITE
18:13:39 <Bio> ???
18:13:44 <Bio> sweetie gets it
18:15:05 <Zounds> UTC isn't a eu timezone
18:15:37 <skram> Nei its a universal standard to tell time
18:15:51 <skram> eg central whatever is UTC-5
18:16:39 <skram> which means yokel time is 5 hours behind a given reference
18:16:40 <Dot> UTC replaced GMT zounds
18:16:44 <skram> its the same as greenwich mean time
18:16:54 <Zounds> GMT is a timezone though
18:16:58 <Zounds> UTC is not a timezone
18:17:05 <Zounds> Even though they are the same time
18:17:19 <Dot> ah, like that
18:17:21 <Dot> true
18:17:26 <skram> yes they use the same reference
18:18:10 <Zounds> Anyway, fuck daylight savings
18:19:14 <Zounds> Half the year i'm in GMT which is also the same time as the standard UTC
18:20:13 <Zounds> Then I'm +1 for the other half
18:20:28 <Dot> daylight savings is a mistake
18:20:39 <Zounds> It's asinine
18:22:53 <Dot> when i asked ppl they said they tried once and kids got hit by cars because it was dark in the morning...
18:23:03 <Dot> i got this story from 2 diffrent ppl
18:23:07 <Dot> they believe it
18:23:57 <DuB`> It's true, I had to dodge cars driving all over the sidewalks when I walked to school as a child
18:24:01 <DuB`> lul
18:24:40 <Dot> but dub its even more stuipid that that because its dark 50% of the time they walk to school anyway
