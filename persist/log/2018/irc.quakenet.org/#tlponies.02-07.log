00:59:18 <Dot`> Hey micen
00:59:29 <PengWin> o/ micen
00:59:47 <Micen|Droid> Hi peng. 
01:02:20 <Dot`> hows the shield battery been doing pengu? i havnt watched too much sc2 recently
01:04:18 <DuB`> sOs passed MC for highest sc2 winnings last night :T
01:04:28 <PengWin> shield battery is dumb
01:04:29 <Dot`> D:
01:04:33 <PengWin> needs to cost 75/25
01:04:34 <Dot`> we need MC back
01:04:36 <PengWin> mineral only is retarded
01:04:45 <PengWin> more of a problem in tvp than tvz
01:05:05 <PengWin> pvz**
01:07:42 <Dot`> hows the lack of Core doing? are ppl enjoying protoss again?
01:08:04 <PengWin> idk, msc was dumb but most of the dumb shit's still in
01:08:07 <PengWin> like free recall
01:08:19 <PengWin> I think battery is way dumber than overcharge
01:08:34 <PengWin> tbh game design atm is kinda trash tier
01:08:36 <PengWin> they need to fix it
01:08:40 <PengWin> zerg is just boring as fuck
01:08:42 <Crisium> theres a shield battery?
01:08:44 <Crisium> and its good?
01:09:11 <PengWin> they nerfed every unit composition over the last year and a half except ling hydra bane, so we can only play ling hydra bane, then now they nerfed hydras and didn't compensate with anything else so zerg winrate's gonna be a meme this month
01:09:17 <PengWin> ye shield battery is imba vs terran
01:09:21 <Crisium> lol
01:09:21 <PengWin> just stupid vs zerg, not really imba
01:09:33 <Crisium> shield battery was like only used for anti all ins in bw
01:09:37 <Crisium> howd they make it op
01:09:47 <PengWin> vs terran
01:09:49 <PengWin> you proxy a stargate
01:09:52 <PengWin> make 6 shield batteries
01:09:53 <PengWin> and void rays
01:10:01 <Dot`> lol

01:22:34 <Dot`> dub, do we know if the rocket is safe yet?
01:22:51 <DuB`> Dunno
01:22:56 <DuB`> Probly not at this point lol
01:23:49 <Phearlock_> Watched the press conference
01:24:09 <Phearlock_> the core stage did not make it as it had an issue relighting 2 of its 3 engines for the landing burn.
01:24:31 <Phearlock_> Elon has assured us that the footage is great and hopefully they'll release that sometime in the next week.
01:24:49 <Dot`> poor core :(
01:25:13 <Phearlock_> Everything else is going great, and the two boosters had the most expensive parts on them so they're happy to have those successfully recovered.
01:26:09 <Phearlock_> (something about having to beef up the grid fins due to the aerodynamics being different when you have a cone on top instead of a hollow cylinder.
01:28:09 <skram> The footage of the two boosters landing at the same time was the coolest shit though
01:29:03 <Phearlock_> and being able to watch a livestream of a car floating around in space

23:55:20 <Dot`> Dub, ponies are hard to corral
23:58:14 <DuB`> Truly
23:58:19 <DuB`> Better to just eat them.
23:58:21 <DuB`> https://www.twitch.tv/overwatchleague
23:59:05 <DuB`> We were able to corral ponies into surprisingly untoppled stacks THREE times last week for OW, was nice.
23:59:19 <Crisium> we had a 6 stack
23:59:20 <Dot`> ponies are friends not food dub
23:59:27 <skrm> We even did well last time
