00:06:32 <DuB`> Terrararer
00:07:00 <Dot> you winning?
00:23:22 <DuB`> Yeh
00:23:33 <DuB`> Made a big granite and marble castle tower house.
00:23:42 <DuB`> To put all my BOOKS in.
00:26:58 <Dot> BOOOOKS
00:36:23 <Camail> dub are you making a wizard tower
00:36:25 <Camail> are you a wizard
00:36:51 <DuB`> I am
00:36:57 <DuB`> I am
00:37:00 <Camail> nrd
00:37:20 <Camail> double nerd
00:56:24 <DuB`> Man
00:56:34 <DuB`> I get 7mb up/down on this wifi and thought everything would be fine
00:56:44 <DuB`> But 13k ping to discord is really... something
00:58:55 <Bio> v nerd boi
01:10:51 <Phearlock> Leaving your good internet behind
01:11:00 <Phearlock> It probably misses you terribly
01:11:09 <Phearlock> ;_;
01:11:16 <DuB`> Will be back to 100/100 or better in the fall, it's fiiiine :P
01:22:23 <Camail> you can get a router
01:22:34 <Camail> like, just give it the same SSID and password
01:23:22 <Camail> there are solutions, wifi is very reliable in this latest generation of hardware
01:27:34 <Camail> discord doesnt do well with inconsistent connections, i've known people on wifi who had trouble
01:30:56 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/dnd
01:31:00 <Camail> big bois
01:31:04 <Camail> battling
01:31:21 <Camail> they got the fuckin big show
01:31:25 <Camail> makes travis look small
02:21:42 <Bio> what chars are they playing
02:21:58 <Bio> also man that dude in the black is huuuge
02:35:13 <Camail> thats a wwe wrestler, big show
02:35:36 <Camail> travis and joe are playing their VM characters
02:35:41 <Camail> the others dont REALLY matter
03:07:28 <Bio> man it would be super cool if arkhan showed up in critrole as a villain or something
03:07:31 <Bio> in season 2
03:35:21 <Camail> i mean, they're all still in world, it's a matter of if they interfere in something he'd be doing
03:35:54 <Camail> matt doesnt seem like the kind of person who would want to do a callback unless it really makes a lot of sense
03:36:00 <Bio> they did just break a tiamat phone
03:36:19 <Camail> yea but they are also level 4
03:36:33 <Bio> tru
03:36:39 <Bio> maybe much later
03:36:48 <Camail> unless they do more anti-tiamat stuff and start attacking the cult, i dont see it happening
03:37:40 <Bio> we shall see. I'm super biased towards tiamat stuff, wanna see that encounter at lvl 20 for sure

22:50:24 <Camail> it's kinda interesting that he looks like a junky and she has a ton of makeup on
22:53:57 <DuB`> Man all these COLORS shows are crazy good
23:17:39 <Camail> skram i just carried hard in a big boy group, and there was a guy insulting everyone in broken english
23:17:45 <Camail> did i accidently start playing dota
23:17:52 <Camail> is this what eu feels like
23:17:53 <skram> haha
23:17:57 <skram> yes
23:18:01 <Camail> wow

23:18:18 <Dot> lol
23:18:20 <skram> was he eastern european by chance
23:18:32 <Camail> its hard to tell, its text based
23:18:51 <Camail> but his version of "hey can we brake the tail" was "broken tail"
23:19:04 <Camail> so there's a failure of understanding parts of speech
23:19:39 <skram> sounds familiar
23:21:06 <DuB`> How's dauntless been?
23:21:19 <skram> pretty daunting actually
23:24:55 <Dot> is nice game, missing 1 dub though

23:30:56 <DuB`> I have no more dubs
23:31:14 <Dot> ive never seen 2 dubs in 1 place
