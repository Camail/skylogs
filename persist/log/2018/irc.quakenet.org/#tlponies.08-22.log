02:25:54 <skrm> BUT
02:26:01 <skrm> with 1 bread
02:26:14 <skrm> so the topping to meat ratio is far better
02:26:27 <skrm> err meat to bread ratio
02:26:33 <DuB`> Or
02:26:39 <DuB`> You could have a full real sammich
02:26:43 <DuB`> And just add more meat!
02:26:45 <DuB`> Maths
02:27:11 <DuB`> Why subtract when you can add
02:27:19 <skrm> Well then your sandwich would be so big that you couldnt eat it, DuB`

22:51:43 <Dot`> i ended up caving and got Escape from Tarkov, my need for stalker like games was too great
22:51:52 <Dot`> and the Russian PMC is called Bear
22:52:14 <Camail> your desperate need to manually refill your magazine
22:52:22 <Dot`> yes
22:52:33 <Dot`> its very Arma like in many ways too
22:52:42 <Dot`> like the amount of bugs
22:52:45 <Dot`> :P
22:53:30 <Dot`> but also in complexity/versitility of controls
22:55:26 <Dot`> but DnD side, i have a lot more i can do for prep, but depending on which quest you pick most would be useless
23:44:44 <Camail> yea, so should we decide before the first game?
23:52:59 <Dot`> yip, you pick what you wan tto do
23:53:34 <Dot`> then after the first one if you want to investigate something you heard about or saw before
23:54:01 <Dot`> you get 2-4 other ppl who want to go to and say when you want to play
23:54:40 <Phearlock> I am terrible at suggesting when to play so I'll probably panic finish a character once there's a potential date I can do
23:54:59 <Phearlock> It's how these things go.
23:57:25 <Camail> play NOW
23:57:26 <Camail> gogogo
23:57:41 <Dot`> well its up to players to sort out the date phear, im am not giving one
23:59:21 <Phearlock> Speaking of dnd, is biogame back yet?
23:59:27 <Phearlock> Or he still busy
