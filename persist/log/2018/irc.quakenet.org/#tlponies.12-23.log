00:21:15 <Dot`> gnight reif
00:21:39 <skram> good night
00:30:46 <BioPhone> Neigh
00:31:08 <BioPhone> I got to smash brothers with my real brother
00:31:13 <BioPhone> Yey
00:34:56 <Dot`> fuck this game cam
00:35:01 <Dot`> i aint going down that deep again
00:35:04 <Camail> ahahaha
00:35:11 <Camail> its so scary
00:35:15 <Camail> but i believe in you
00:35:32 <skram> dot did a swear
00:35:33 <skram> dang
00:35:41 <DuB`> O snap lol
00:35:41 <Dot`> "ecological dead zone" here, have a thing to read
00:35:45 <Dot`> then suddently
00:35:47 <Camail> LUL
00:35:50 <Camail> dont spoil
00:35:52 <Dot`> seamoth on 7 health
00:35:54 <Camail> i know what you're talking about
00:36:01 <Camail> yea, its the first big scare
00:36:04 <Dot`> i was tabbed
00:36:12 <Dot`> to READ
00:36:21 <Camail> g a m e d e s i g n
00:36:30 <skram> well thats another game im not gonna play i guess
00:36:39 <Camail> but its so good!
00:36:46 <DuB`> It is nice ocean
00:36:53 <skram> i cant deal with scary games
00:36:54 <skram> at all
00:36:57 <Camail> it is so empowering
00:37:01 <DuB`> pff
00:37:05 <Camail> i never played amnesia
00:37:11 <Camail> but i played this
00:37:14 <DuB`> It's not even scary game, just very... atmospheric
00:37:18 <Camail> because its not really a horror game
00:37:24 <Camail> it is an exploration game with scary elements
00:37:30 <skram> doesnt matter
00:38:15 <Camail> for me the fear enhanced the sense of wonder, but i totally get not wanting to be afraid
00:38:18 <DuB`> What if I hold your hand
00:38:32 <Camail> i dont like horror films or games because its just feeling scared for its own sake
00:38:38 <DuB`> Ya
00:38:56 <DuB`> As someone who has literally refused to see any horror movie for his entire life, it's a nice game
00:38:57 <Camail> this game uses it as a tool and makes it mean something, so it only happens rarely
00:40:29 <Camail> dub how far have you gotten
00:40:38 <DuB`> Hmm
00:41:07 <DuB`> Was about to build bigboi, had a decent base up
00:42:13 <Dot`> dubs further than me then i tihnk, i dont even have fancy sub plans complete
00:44:16 <Camail> the cyclops changes the game
00:44:54 <Camail> it makes it easy to set up a forward operating base even deeper, so you can comfortably explore the deeper faults
00:52:33 <BioPhone> I remember streaming amnesia
00:52:45 <BioPhone> What a spooky boi

12:34:46 <Golly> need butter n things
12:36:21 <Dot> bad plannign golly
12:40:34 <Golly> thinking ahead was never my strong suit
12:43:25 <Runbunny> I am losing at Magic cards.
12:43:45 <Golly> draft?
12:44:27 <Golly> ive felt the 0-3 pain a few times
12:44:59 <Runbunny> Nah constructed ranked.
12:46:02 <Golly> i built a white weenie deck, you either win fast or lose fast
12:46:04 <Golly> pretty nice
12:46:26 <Runbunny> I have a dimir thief of sanity deck that I really enjoy :D
12:46:31 <Golly> oh dear
12:47:12 <Golly> card removal and counterspells are infuriating to play against
12:47:51 <Golly> but at least theres a gimick there
12:48:44 <Runbunny> This is more discard than counter spells though
12:48:51 <Golly> yea
12:48:52 <Runbunny> Still.
12:48:59 <Runbunny> It's fun to bully sometimes :D
12:49:23 <Golly> for the one doing the bullying sure ^^
12:50:43 <Golly> the first ravnica drafting was awful though, dimir all over the place
12:51:19 <Runbunny> There are some pretty neat dimir bombs.
12:53:58 <Golly> https://i.imgur.com/qDnKi3N.jpg
12:55:33 <Runbunny> :D
12:58:49 <Runbunny> There is just something very appealing by using your opponents cards against them.
12:59:30 <Golly> most fun i have is with my skellington/zombie deck
12:59:42 <Golly> bastards keep coming back for more
13:00:43 <Golly> also, very few decks counter graveyard interaction
13:04:20 <Runbunny> Yeah no chalice of the void :/
13:15:21 <Golly> im pretty new to magic, but that seems strong
13:29:15 <Runbunny> I played very little in my youth. I did however pick it up again here with arena and all.
