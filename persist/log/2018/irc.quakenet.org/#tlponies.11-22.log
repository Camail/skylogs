00:05:51 <Camail> Cane  infiltration is out of competition for 2 years
00:06:04 <Camail> https://twitter.com/PandaGlobal/status/1063178679566635008?s=19
00:06:15 <Camail> plenty of info
00:07:01 <Camail> seems pretty complicated, it's not as bad as it could've been, and it's basically a voluntary exile, but not really
00:07:41 <reification> https://twitter.com/KOSMICKATIE/status/1064568778631999488
00:17:53 <Camail> in summation, every allegation was refuted other than the initial domestic violence fine. well at least we know the truth
00:18:24 <Camail> the punishment is cool, i'm just glad he is an idiot and not a sociopathic monster
00:25:44 <Camail> sorry bio i got distracted, been waiting for answer on that case for literal months 
00:26:03 <Camail> wanna shootbangs?
00:27:11 <Bio> in a bit
00:27:17 <Bio> gimme like 15 ish
00:27:38 <Camail> kk
00:36:45 <Cane> Camail, thanks for the info man. I still don't know what the original domestic violence incident was that started all this.
00:36:58 <Cane> I heard about some of this obviously, but it's been kind of a clusterfuck.
00:37:02 <Camail> two tweets down is the info they have
00:37:25 <Camail> they had an argument that escalated back in 2017
00:37:52 <Camail> whatever happened there, infil was found guilty and fined
00:38:10 <Camail> all the other stuff is BS, capcom and pg are reacting to that one thing
00:38:29 <Cane> Okay, so he talked to the police and confessed to shit before seeking legal counsel.
00:38:30 <Cane> So, idiot.
00:38:43 <Cane> At least we can confirm blithering tool.
00:39:35 <Camail> yea i'd prefer dumb eccentric mistake backed by cultural misogyny than a cheating lying manipulative asshole
00:39:44 <Cane> Same.
00:39:56 <Camail> given how many of those have been popping up lately
00:40:59 <Cane> If I'm reading this right: $700 fine for misdemeanor battery after police "advised" him to confess to it, and he's trying now to say he didn't do it/that the altercation was mutual. Apart from that we don't know and might never know.
00:41:49 <Cane> Fucktard, but yeah, probably not a genuinely abusive sociopath.
00:41:54 <Camail> there were also various other fines throuought the year
00:42:06 <Camail> but those were all non-combative things
00:42:26 <Camail> she refused to let him back into their house unless he promised not to divorce her
00:42:28 <Cane> Yeah, typical divorce stuff.
00:42:32 <Camail> which itself is REALLY REALLY WEIRD
00:42:39 <Cane> That one's odd yeah.
00:42:43 <Camail> like wtf thats so weird
00:42:44 <Cane> She seems... strange.
00:43:27 <Camail> i've never heard of an abuse victim who acted like that, it doesn't rule anything out it just complicates things
00:44:19 <skram> ...That makes it seem like the girl is the abusive one in this relationship
00:45:03 <Camail> I'm leaning towards a mutually toxic relationship
00:45:14 <Cane> Yeah, mutual altercation during the break-up led to (allegedly) mutual battery which Infiltration admitted to WITHOUT LEGAL COUNSEL, so he's on the hook and she's not. I'm with Camail on this one, sounds toxic.
00:51:26 <reification> night all
00:51:52 <Bio> bek
00:54:10 <Camail> keb
00:59:22 <Camail> and now we wait
00:59:33 <Camail> unless we want to give up and play dust 2
00:59:47 <Camail> because silvers are all too scared of learning maps
00:59:55 <Bio> NEIN

02:44:36 <Camail> ggs
02:44:43 <Camail> thought i'd give that guy a chance
02:44:48 <Camail> wont do that again
02:44:54 <Camail> he was fine but he's a kid
02:45:14 <Bio> I Took my headphones off for that second 3v1
02:45:24 <Bio> probably not the right thing
02:45:31 <Bio> but wanted to focus
02:45:52 <Camail> none of them were toxic, bu they had terrible comms
02:45:59 <Camail> but its silver
02:46:06 <Bio> yeh
02:46:23 <Bio> i was more frustrated cause I couldn't get anything going that match
02:46:36 <Bio> seemed like i was always working with subpar loadouts
02:46:51 <Bio> then just getting oneshot
02:47:16 <Camail> ehhhhh
02:48:01 <Camail> we very rarely needed to force
02:48:07 <Camail> i had a rifle in all the rounds i wanted one
02:48:47 <Camail> but if you have an smg, play like you have one, play tight angles, use movement during fights
02:49:03 <Camail> especially at the beginning of the round, timings dictate where you can get to before contact
02:49:32 <Camail> i would just get to a good spot, do a safe peek for info, then take more ground if i could
02:50:13 <Camail> you played fine game 1 and the first side
02:50:29 <Camail> if you want to prevent tilt, or reset after tilt, you have to have a default you are comfortable playing
02:50:42 <Camail> so it lets you take fights to regain confidence, but not in a reckless way
02:54:08 <Bio> it was only the last game
02:55:02 <Camail> a is difficult to hold on ct side
02:56:15 <Camail> that 14-14 round made me a bit annoyed...
02:56:29 <Camail> doing 450 damage in a round feels bad
02:56:54 <Bio> yeah, i lost the fight upper, probably could have turned that round
02:57:01 <Bio> luckily i got him the next round
