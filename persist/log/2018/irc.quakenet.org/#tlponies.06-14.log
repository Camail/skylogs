21:38:57 <skrm> Dot
21:39:26 <skrm> what i love about my work computer is that its so thin and flimsy that i sometimes have to bend it flat again
21:39:50 <Camail> that seems unhealthy for the rigid boards inside
21:42:59 <skrm> Having a wonky laptop that slaps against the table top when you type is pretty unhealthy for me personally
22:04:53 <skrm> Got my summer bonus today

23:45:09 <Dot> well skram, you said you wanted to save for a house, but if you think you need a pc you should get one
23:45:57 <skrm> i am getting one
23:46:10 <skrm> i just dont know what parts are the good ones anymore
23:46:18 <Dot> the epxensive ones
23:47:40 <skrm> ya its gonna be like 2.5k dollarydoos apparently
23:48:12 <skrm> for a 1080/i5-8700 box
23:50:09 <Camail> almost nothing is cpu intensive anymore
23:50:30 <Camail> i've never seen the point of getting the best processor
23:51:53 <DuB`> Should be able to get i5 and 1080 for 2k or less, skram :o
23:52:26 <skrm> in america maybe :p
23:52:35 <DuB`> Ah hmm
23:53:09 <Camail> maybe
23:53:12 <Camail> live in america
23:53:14 <Dot> just have dub ship it
23:53:17 <Camail> that would be very convenient for me
23:53:46 <skrm> I told you cam, I dont want to be the little spoon
23:55:31 <DuB`> Time to shop for foods and probably end up buying donuts because that shop is right next to grocery store
23:55:42 <skrm> resist the temptation
23:55:44 <skrm> i believe in u
23:56:59 <DuB`> Nah
