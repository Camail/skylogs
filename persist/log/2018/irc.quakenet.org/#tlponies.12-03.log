21:40:57 <Dot`> too early reif
21:41:00 <Dot`> its the 3rd
21:41:17 <Camail> twitter is more universal, and artists are less likely to have a twitter exclusively for their art
21:41:34 <Camail> which is not great for my interests
21:41:52 <Camail> because everyone is pretty damn boring at least 75% of the time
21:43:45 <DuB`> Do we BORE YOU
21:46:02 <Dot`> only 75% of the time apparently dub
21:46:35 <Camail> i bore myself
21:46:43 <skram> well if we take turns we can ensure that 3 of us are boring all the time
21:46:53 <DuB`> :D
21:47:05 <Camail> you three need to take shifts being interesting
