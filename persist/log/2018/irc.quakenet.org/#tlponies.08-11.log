00:14:36 <Runbunny> Not best Jeanist, Camail?
00:14:47 <Camail> he's my favorite jeanist
00:14:50 <Camail> but not character
00:15:33 <Camail> the only character i dislike is grape boy
00:15:47 <Camail> literally every other character is interesting or cool
00:17:34 <Runbunny> But Camail https://i.imgur.com/p1xSiOw.jpg
00:18:03 <Camail> yea, despite the obvious satirical tone if he didnt exist my life would be just a little better
00:18:39 <Runbunny> He is horrible. But that picture is still hilarious.

14:02:15 <Dot> skrma pls
14:02:28 <skrma> clam down love
14:02:43 <Dot> i panicked
14:02:46 <Dot> im better now
14:03:37 <Dot> ive been thinking skram as you know of runnign a dnd game, and i think a West marches style game could work well
14:05:10 <skrma> i dont know what a west marches is
14:05:29 <Dot> if only you spent as much time as me reading useless DnD stuff
14:07:42 <Dot> let me get coffee and try tihnk of a coherent way to describe it
14:08:10 <skrma> i do like it when you are coherent
14:09:59 <Dot> it doesnt happen often
14:13:30 <Dot> West Marches games are set in a border town with nothing but wilderness beyond. Its player driven with no set party, so you cna play it with 10 people, but only 4 or 5 might go out at once.  
14:14:13 <Dot> there is no overarching plot. You saw a goblin hunting party and want to track down where they came from or why they are there, go for it
14:14:36 <skrma> think i get it
14:14:41 <skrma> sounds cool though
14:15:00 <Dot> but in that cave of goblins you find a old magical dwarven axe with runes
14:15:17 <Dot> might lead to trying to find where it came form and there being a dwarven mine
14:15:48 <skrma> So its the pen and paper equivalent of a sandbox game
14:16:52 <Dot> yea, it gets more dangerous the further form town you go (normaly)
