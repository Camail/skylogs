00:21:41 <skram> why is it so hot inside
00:21:51 <skram> its like -5 outside and i dont have a heater on
00:22:05 <skram> maybe its because ive been concentrating really hard on my torbjorb play
00:22:09 <DuB`> Yeah
00:22:12 <DuB`> Spicy OW skills
00:23:22 <Crisium> too much torbjob
00:24:55 <skram> lies
00:24:58 <skram> not nearly enough
00:25:12 <DuB`> Enough for a lifetime, all in one day!
00:25:22 <DuB`> Your mental fortitude is applause-worthy
00:25:23 <skram> y u booly me

00:32:08 <DuB`> I hope he's back
00:33:08 <DuB`> Mebbe I go get tacobell for brekfest
00:33:48 <skram> sometimes im grateful theres no such thing as tacobell where I live
00:33:56 <DuB`> Why
00:34:00 <DuB`> That sounds awfully inconvenient
00:34:15 <skram> because i would eat 84 tacos in one sitting, DuB`
00:34:21 <DuB`> aha
00:34:30 <DuB`> I actually hate 95% of their menu
00:34:30 <skram> i would taco myself to DEATH
00:34:40 <DuB`> But crunchwraps and quesaritos are so worth
00:34:54 <skram> There's DIFFERENT TYPES?
00:34:55 <skram> yoooo
00:35:29 <Bio> so many ways 
00:35:30 <DuB`> Ye

00:36:23 <skram> make music not computer noises amirite
00:36:32 <DuB`> I am disappoint
00:36:35 <skram> :D
00:37:13 <skram> i am joke, clam down fren
00:45:33 <DuB`> Oof, my room also got quite hot
00:45:43 <DuB`> Those tracer games musta turned it up a few degrees ;D
00:45:51 <skram> probably
00:58:15 <Camail> we could cool down with in house wingman
00:58:22 <Camail> nothing is calmer than playing vs your friends in cs
