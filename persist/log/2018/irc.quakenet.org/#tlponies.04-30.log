01:42:13 <DuB`> Cane: The first feels more nethack-y but the second would obviously be more inviting for less-initiated viewers (like me).

15:20:07 <Runbunny> Thank you Jonas.
15:20:10 <skrm> Its fine I think
15:20:23 <skrm> They had to shut the turbine down earlier today so there was some drama but seems quiet now

15:24:28 <skrm> yeah
15:24:30 <skrm> fuck italy
15:28:19 <skrm> Italy is pretty good at building turbogenerator sets but their customer service leaves much to be desired, Dot` 
15:29:07 <skrm> They also refuse to use the international standard for system tags but thats a whole other thing

16:05:14 <Zounds> Why are your notes not complete dot
16:05:21 <Dot`> because i am bad
16:05:55 <DuB`> reification, dang right Monogatari on that shelf :P
16:06:12 <Zounds> What sort of notes do you take in dnd anyway
16:06:27 <Zounds> A list of events and outcomes? or something?
16:06:43 <DuB`> Important tasks, people, places to remember
16:07:03 <Zounds> Makes sense
16:07:16 <DuB`> So that when you go to do thing you don't end up all, "That... one guy told us to come here and meet... someone? We're not sure."
16:07:37 <Zounds> Useful to take notes as an adventurer when time stops and you go into a coma every week until it's time to go agian
