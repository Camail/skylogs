00:01:43 <Dot`> how was work skram
00:09:20 <skram> shitty
00:09:32 <skram> i didnt sleep at all last night so i crashed pretty hard when i came home
00:14:50 <Dot`> :(
00:14:53 <Dot`> better now?
00:15:50 <skram> good enough mr Dot`
00:15:53 <skram> what you been up to
00:19:46 <Dot`> i had work, then played some Division
00:19:56 <Dot`> then read book
00:21:58 <Camail> dot have you done any DZ stuff
00:25:31 <Camail> oddly enough, its more fun to be nice in the DZ because you can so easily be shitty during someone's moment of weakness
00:26:10 <Camail> i was about to head to dz1 extravtion point , then saw someone set off the dz2 extraction point and i was way closer to that so i thought i'd see if there was room for me
00:26:36 <Camail> by the time i get there i see 4-5 mobs and a corpse with a purple on it
00:27:04 <Camail> clear the mobs, wait for the guy, but don't take his shit. I let him have it, then the helicopter came and i put my stuff on...and he never put his stuff on
00:27:23 <Dot`> lol
00:27:24 <Camail> he called the drop, died, got his stuff back, then forgot to extract it, so i waited with him for the next extract
00:27:32 <Dot`> i havnt done any dz stuff
00:27:58 <Dot`> got to lvl 21 now, so i tihnk i have caught up to you in base lvls
00:28:10 <Dot`> or close at least
00:28:23 <Camail> I'm 24
00:28:34 <Camail> just chilling doing DZ until everyone catches up
00:28:56 <Camail> got tot he point where my custom m44 is doing 50k+ per headshot
00:30:07 <Camail> DZ is a fun social experiment 
00:31:07 <Camail> assault rifles are way better in dz than normal pve cuz every enemy has most of its hp in armor
00:38:34 <Dot`> tomorow i can DZ a bit cam
00:41:04 <Camail> cool, we can probably wrangle dub in too

04:22:25 <Camail> I didn't even get a particularly full sense of satisfaction betraying a guy in DZ
04:27:42 <Bio> gotta have those personal ties
04:40:25 <Camail> i helped him clear the site, waited a bit, realized he was only lvl 20 and also alone
04:40:57 <Camail> killed him then ran a decent distance away and he caught up to be literally 2-3 seconds after my rogue status was up
04:41:15 <Camail> so we kinda just stood next to each other, but he was hopelessly shooting through my model
04:42:12 <Camail> followed me around, eventually did a extraction juke and ran to a harder area that he couldn't handle...and in the end i just sold his stuff for like...4k
04:58:28 <Bio> poor guy
05:02:16 <Camail> yea it was kinda sad, there were a few purples, and he put his extraction marker behind a tent so he looked like this really scared, really dumb puppy
05:02:59 <Camail> i didnt even attack him first, i was so obviously on his side i was able to get 60% through the hijack before he attacked me, and unloaded an entire clip but still didnt kill me
05:03:50 <Camail> the whole thing could be backed by a single violin and a 6 year street urchin crying in an alley-way
05:04:15 <Bio> all around me are familiar faces... worn out places...
05:06:16 <Camail> well the good thing is that i taught him not to be so trusting
