01:44:02 <Camail> man, the silent is so annoying to get a heart kill with
01:44:40 <Camail> i bet the best option is poison
01:51:29 <Runbunny> I haven't seen shiv. 
01:51:35 <Runbunny> But poison seems really good.
01:54:15 <Camail> i just dont like her cards
01:55:49 <Runbunny> Silent seems easiest to play, I haven't played the game though.
01:56:02 <Runbunny> but based on my observations.
01:57:09 <Camail> ironclad is the easiest
02:07:01 <Dot> lol cam, the green flash of light

22:27:13 <Runbunny> Camail, yeah I figured
22:27:24 <Runbunny> Also I just got behemoth down. What a fight.

23:17:07 <Camail> flying around doesn't seem to be as good as i wanted it to be
23:17:29 <Camail> but it helps to maneuver around the big boys
23:20:21 <Runbunny> Mounting is really strong though, obviously more so when in a group.
23:20:48 <Camail> yea, and its a safe, but slow, way of making sure you have your buffs
23:21:04 <Runbunny> Grounded comboes are also stronger. Jumping around is fun though :D
23:27:28 <Camail> wanna hunt some more?
23:30:11 <Runbunny> Sure.
