18:08:03 <DuB`> Golly: Those aren't tradable -- there's a whole bunch of stuff you need to get from clans, I'd recommend just joining one especially as most have no requirements/restrictions!
18:08:21 <Golly> ah ok
18:10:59 <Golly> most of the ones i see recruiting require discord and stuff, i mostly solo so
