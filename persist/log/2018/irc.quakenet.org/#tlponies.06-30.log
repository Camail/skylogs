01:42:41 <Cane> We're made for the arctic circle.
01:42:59 <Cane> I would camp out next to a fridge all day.
01:43:13 <Cane> And when I say next to, I mean inside.
01:45:01 <DuB`> NorCal is the opposite of hot!
01:45:16 <DuB`> As in "not hot"!
01:45:28 <DuB`> But not cold, so maybe not the opposite...
01:46:06 <Cane> I'm sorry, what temperatures is California getting right now?
01:46:16 <Cane> I seem to remember the state being on fire.
01:47:21 <DuB`> Room temperature outside right now at 7pm
