01:52:46 <Cane> Lately some odd typos have cropped up in gaming as the cause for some unintended bad AI behavior.
01:53:19 <Cane> First there was the Civ 6 thing where Yield was spelled as Yeild, so the AI made some horribly messed up decisions.
01:53:29 <Cane> Leader priorities were all out of wack.
01:54:15 <Cane> Oh, and then as if Aliens: Colonial Marines wasn't bad enough, there's a single typo in the default config file that, wait for it, disables most of the enemy AI.
01:55:38 <Cane> And I just thought about my time modding STALKER, where there are numerous typos in the game's config files, but they are well documented by the modders as "eurojank slav code" and that's how it needs to be spelled for the game to recognize it.
02:02:02 <Cane> All in all, I think I prefer ADIDAS coders who think something rebounding off something else is called a "bonce" than a regular one who fell asleep during the I before E revision course.

05:43:25 <skrm> how you bean
06:02:37 <Camail> he's dead, apparently
06:02:53 <Camail> i am here, playing vidgam
06:03:00 <Camail> debating on whether or not to go to the city tomorrow
06:03:09 -!- Golly [~Golly@1.92-221-121.customer.lyse.net] has joined #tlponies
06:04:12 <skrm> why you goin to the big city cam
06:04:39 <Camail> for fun, probably
06:04:55 <skrm> hmm
06:05:04 <Camail> haven't hung out with my brother in a few weeks, so might go up
06:05:26 <Camail> did you have the graveyard shift or did you just start working
06:05:41 <skrm> morning shift
06:05:46 <skrm> its 8, started at 7
06:06:32 <Camail> that's nice, pretending to be a normal person. you had a hectic schedule this week, is that normal?
06:06:51 <skrm> i have a 6-week rotation thing
06:07:23 <skrm> so 60 hours this week, next week off, then another 32 hours and then 60 etc
06:07:37 <Camail> ah, cool
06:07:59 <Camail> you have all the time in the world to bug dub to tunnel underneath his room and lay a lan line
06:08:39 <skrm> maybe he should ask old musk for help
06:08:44 <skrm> he's got a boring company apparently
06:09:35 <skrm> wait so which city is The City
06:51:19 <Camail> cihcago
06:51:23 <Camail> chicago*
06:51:52 <Camail> sorry i got distracted, trying to learn rimworld because it looks fun despite all my instincts telling me it's not
06:53:00 <Camail> and boy, this psychopath teenagers is hard carrying me
06:53:47 <skrm> Hasnt rimworld been early access for like 5 years now
06:55:06 <Camail> yea, even tho it is basically a full game
06:55:22 <Camail> i think its the right way to abuse it, like factorio does
06:55:52 <Camail> there's no measurement for completion, so the devs never have to go out of early access
06:55:59 <skrm> hmm
06:56:14 <skrm> yeah i suppose thats true
06:56:18 <Camail> it's also a huge logistical issue when you fully release the game because then steam treats it differently
06:57:02 <skrm> So its just easier to keep it as a beta version or whatever since its its continually worked on and expanded
06:57:09 <Camail> yea
06:59:14 <Rawr|Fone> Skrm
06:59:35 <skrm> Henrik, god morgon
