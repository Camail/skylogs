00:01:04 <DoT`> character looks good, if you want you can roll 7 times on Xanathars This is my life thing
00:01:09 <DoT`> see if you get any free stuff
00:01:47 <skram> all i got from xanathars was ptsd
00:02:10 <DoT`> it was inevitable
00:04:33 <DoT`> also Phearlock, we are lvl 3 start
00:05:05 <Phearlock_> oh right gotta hit the levelup button

00:26:28 <Camail> yea the lvl 1 character creation is really smooth
00:26:36 <Camail> then you have to manually do everything else
00:26:47 <Camail> or any of the things that arent part of the SRD
00:27:04 <Camail> so what is our team comp
00:27:11 <Camail> I'm fightmen

00:29:02 <Camail> skram are you rageboi
00:31:08 <skram> nay
00:31:10 <skram> i am the druid
00:31:16 <skram> one of them
00:31:44 <skram> obviously he is angry all the time too but its not very productive
00:32:25 <Camail> make plants wave angrily
00:32:36 <Camail> so druid fighter and rogue?
00:32:45 <skram> think so
00:33:29 <DoT`> seems like a workable comp
00:33:41 <DoT`> healing is a bit low, but druid form tanks 
00:34:31 <Camail> and i give people disadvantage on attack
00:34:33 <skram> i dont have healing spells
00:34:39 <DoT`> lol
00:34:44 <Camail> you have animal shapes
00:34:47 <skram> i lost them in an unfortunate mining accident
00:34:55 <Camail> why would a druid mine
00:35:11 <Camail> i have pre-healing
00:35:18 <Camail> i make it hard for them to hit you guys
00:35:32 <skram> actually i do have healing touch
00:35:37 <skram> but not goodberries
00:35:49 <Camail> wtf goodberries are great
00:35:56 <skram> yeh
00:36:00 <skram> spell list needs work
00:36:12 <Camail> dont druids know all their spells
00:36:37 <skram> spells yes cantrips no
00:36:41 <skram> goodberries are cantrips
00:37:01 <DoT`> they are?
00:37:05 <Camail> no
00:37:06 <DoT`> are you sure?
00:37:08 <Camail> skram is wrong
00:37:10 <Camail> its 1st level

00:38:23 <skram> yyyyyyyyy
00:39:06 <Camail> y?
00:39:12 <skram> aye
00:40:00 <Camail> so you can do goodberry, all is good in the world
00:40:10 <Phearlock_> I can run away
00:40:13 <skram> i can choose not to
00:40:15 <Camail> but it's not a big deal, no need feel obligated to prepare it
00:40:39 <skram> charm person is the most important spell
00:41:17 <DoT`> use your dorfen charm
00:47:26 <Phearlock_> turn into a cute doggo and look cute
00:47:31 <Phearlock_> person = charmed
00:47:38 <Phearlock_> if they're not charmed we know they're pure evil
00:48:33 <Camail> I'm gonna wake up as early as my body will allow, i promise
00:48:53 <Camail> which i wont lie, still isn't as early as we'd all hope
00:49:09 <Phearlock_> I still have to come home from work
00:49:17 <DoT`> maybe ill get prep done by then
00:49:20 <Phearlock_> So you don't have to be crack of dawn early
00:49:30 <DoT`> or maybe ill have to wing it all
00:49:54 <skram> first hour is awkward introductions anyway
00:50:11 <DoT`> oh yea! awkward introductions, yay
00:50:12 <skram> do we need to figure why we're doing all this stuff together or can we just skip that part
00:50:47 <DoT`> your all here to head out
00:50:56 <DoT`> wether its for wealth, fame, death wish
00:51:40 <Camail> my character is always naked from the waste down
00:51:46 <Camail> he has very sweaty thighs
00:51:56 <DoT`> by fame, i mean none becuase no one knows or cares what happens this far away from civilisation
00:52:00 <Camail> and he makes eye contact the entire time
00:54:02 <Camail> people who come here probably dont bond very much
00:54:15 <Camail> lots of fear and desperation tends to put up the emotional walls
00:54:24 <DoT`> oh god, i dont have a tavern name
00:55:01 <Camail> the fuck barn
00:55:19 <Camail> Stonehearth Inn
00:55:26 <Camail> Castaways
00:56:21 <DoT`> Boatmurdered
00:56:52 <Camail> something about a dead end
00:56:56 <Camail> like a roadblock
00:57:02 <DoT`> yea
00:57:05 <Camail> or references the fact that this is the last palce your gonna be
00:57:07 <DoT`> i will tihnk on this
00:57:26 <Camail> The Last Straw
00:57:37 <DoT`> probably has a sign with a diffrent name, but no one calls it by its original name
00:57:48 <Camail> look dot, I'm just gonna say that Fuck Barn is still probably the best
00:58:01 <skram> there will be no fucking
00:58:03 <skram> barns are ok
00:58:16 <Camail> boo
00:58:36 <skram> no more than a masturbation shed
00:58:39 <skram> final offer
00:58:56 <Camail> Fondle Zoo
00:59:25 <skram> handjob menagerie
00:59:58 <Camail> Reach Around Ranch
01:00:53 <skram> molestation aquarium
01:02:00 <Camail> leave the manta rays alone
01:02:26 <skram> its the only thing that gets me goign these days cam
01:02:27 <Camail> Finger Farm
01:02:42 <Camail> .tag skram a manta ray fetishist
01:03:38 <skram> snogging stable
01:06:08 <Camail> DoT`  are you writing these down
01:06:19 <DoT`> of course
01:06:32 <DoT`> i have a world to populate with places that need names
01:07:16 <Camail> this town is gonna smell like sex
01:07:53 <DoT`> by that you mean sadness and repressed issues
01:10:09 <Camail> yes, sex
01:27:03 <Camail> divinity 2 is pretty similar in feel to Tyranny, especially with how prevalent magic is in all characters
01:27:22 <Camail> i need to try and hype myself up to restart this game after putting 70 hours into the classic version
01:27:31 <Camail> that's going to take some time
02:12:06 <Camail> Cane https://www.twitch.tv/rapha
03:15:45 <Camail> oh man, druid spell recovery is rounded up too
03:15:56 <Camail> i always thought hit dice recovery was the only thing in the entire game that did that
03:17:16 <Camail> fuck i just slipped into making another character
