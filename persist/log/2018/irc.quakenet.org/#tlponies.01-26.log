06:50:21 <Camail> "doing nothing" is basically her gameplan
06:50:32 <Camail> almost an outlook on life, really
06:51:03 <Camail> you learn to accept that she plays in a way that does not mesh with DnD
06:51:19 <DuB`> haha
06:51:36 <Camail> but that's fine the strength of the game is the acting, and she played a really strong role as a character
06:51:46 <Rawr|Fone> Are you guys discussing satanism in my christian chat

20:21:49 <ZK> neeb :/
20:33:26 <DoT|Phone> hey zk
20:37:21 <Camail> the rules say that during a contested roll if the two parties tie then the status quo is maintained
20:38:12 <Camail> so if someone is trying to change something, and the other person is trying to prevent that change, the latter "wins" in so far as their goal is met
20:38:28 <Camail> but then a reroll makes sense because people will just keep trying
20:40:24 <Camail> i wish they would make a remaster of morrowind
20:40:28 <Camail> unles they did instanced cities
20:40:46 <Camail> change nothing, but give me pretty stuff
20:41:01 <Camail> i still have never finished the main story quest for morrowind
20:52:49 <Zounds> I don't think I ever did either
