00:09:31 <Bio> seems better now
00:17:44 <DuB`> Time to see how well I can study for test while watching OWL and CR
00:18:39 <Crisium> ez
00:21:19 <Camail> i can answer that one
00:21:29 <Camail> unlike the questions that will be on your test, that is
00:22:10 <DuB`> One of my easier classes so I'm not to worried
00:22:17 <Camail> it was all a ruse
00:22:22 <Bio> hoo hoo, haa haa
00:22:24 <Camail> the test will be a math test
00:22:51 <Camail> also, Regalia is a good game
00:22:57 <Camail> I'd give it a solid 8
00:25:25 <Camail> I'm not sure if I'd recommend it, i didn't fall in love with it, but i was satisfied the entire way through
00:28:20 <Camail> the characters are quite well written, in their own ways
00:30:25 <DuB`> Mmmm

00:33:43 <Camail> sounds good
00:35:13 <Camail> paizo is making a new pathfinder
00:35:15 <Camail> interesting
00:35:17 <Camail> INTERESTINGGG
00:36:08 <DuB`> I saw the "new pathfinder" thing mercer linked on twitter but don't really know what that means
00:36:43 <Camail> well, pathfinder was inspired by dnd3.5, so this will probably be an updated version of that
00:36:54 <Camail> basically like the other way that 5e could've gone
00:40:31 <Camail> 2e will probably be slightly more simplified but still VASTLY more complex than 5e
00:40:42 <Camail> 5e is very very simple compared to dnd 20 years ago
00:42:27 <DuB`> intursting
00:43:33 <Crisium> yes dub
