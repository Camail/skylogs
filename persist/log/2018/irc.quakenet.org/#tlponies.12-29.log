00:54:32 <Runbunny> Dot` help!
00:54:37 <Dot`> what do
00:54:50 <Runbunny> My computer is misbehaving.
00:55:10 <Runbunny> The small lights in the box are all wrong!
00:55:54 <Dot`> that sounds very odd but not very serious
00:56:40 <Runbunny> This is very serious!
00:56:49 <Runbunny> I can assure you.
00:58:19 <Dot`> now runbun, is it the box on the table that you stare at for hours or the magic box on the floor where all the hundreds of mysterious wires plug in
00:59:47 <Runbunny> The one I stare at.
01:00:56 <Dot`> make sure the cable isnt loose, sometimes they come out slightly and will cause weird colours
01:08:39 <Runbunny> I think it's more the actual wizard inside the box on the floor that is being funky.
01:08:43 <Runbunny> brb restarting

10:45:55 <Dot`> I overslept
10:46:05 <Dot`> and this internet consstantly dropping is annoying
10:54:36 <Dot`> skram
10:55:42 <Dot`> skrm
10:56:45 <skrm> hey buddy
10:56:48 <skrm> how you bean
10:57:09 <Dot`> good
10:57:16 <Dot`> apparently a bit sleepy
10:57:18 <Dot`> you?
10:58:39 <skrm> eh im just sittin here doin a work
11:00:47 <skrm> bit difficult to keep this fire going
11:01:00 <Dot`> why is the fire so tricky?
11:01:46 <skrm> soggy garbage mostly
11:03:15 <skrm> there's like 4 main PID controllers to keep it lit right and if it gets out of their area they start working against each other and you need to put them in their corner and give them a stern talking to
11:03:32 <skrm> maybe one of those DUNCE hats
11:04:06 <Dot`> that seems like bad programming
11:04:26 <Dot`> i know a company that does Control Systems
11:04:32 <Dot`> fix that for you
11:04:47 <skrm> njaa its very tricky because there are quite a few variables that needs to be controlled right
11:06:05 <skrm> You need the flow controller which controls the primary/secondary combustion air flow, one to keep the grates at the correct speed with another controller to keep the layer consitent on the combustion zone
11:07:21 <skrm> then theres the 02 controller which is the main boy that works in a sort of cascade with the grate/pusher bois, because you want to keep a certain % to ensure optimal fireness, if you have excess air i.e. high 02 youll cool your flue gas and everything falls apart
11:08:15 <skrm> and then you have a bunch of factor constants you can change to keep the controllers within their range
11:08:40 <Dot`> "operator adjustable set-points"
11:09:00 <Dot`> ive written that line many times already
11:09:27 <skrm> nah they're not set points
11:11:02 <skrm> its just a value (0.5-1.5) that gets mutiplied the out-value
11:11:36 -!- Rawr|Fone [~AndChat52@m83-185-89-195.cust.tele2.se] has joined #tlponies
11:12:12 <skrm> The SP is a different measurements that gets math'd to a calculated value for another controlly boi and you just change the math a bit
11:12:48 <skrm> you tell it you want a whole ton of steam and then it calculates that you need SO MANY tons of air and then you can just fudge that value a bit
11:13:22 <Dot`> set-point is just the term we use for pretty much any value that is either pre set or adjustable by the operator
11:13:54 <Dot`> if it gets a controll word in the code
11:13:59 <Dot`> or control bi
11:14:00 <Dot`> t
11:15:19 <skrm> Well the set point is specifically the value that goes into a controller whereas this changes your set point in accordance to a factor
11:15:52 <Dot`> ah so its dynamic and set by the plc
11:16:12 <skrm> no
11:16:57 <skrm> however its used where the set point is a calculated value from either a different controller or some sort of f(x) block
