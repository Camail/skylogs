00:03:53 <Dot> hows it going skrm
00:04:21 <skrm> eh
00:04:38 <skrm> my foreman is trying to fuck with my overtime pay
00:04:41 <skrm> its pissing me off
00:05:01 <Dot> :/
00:05:11 <Dot> drive a fork at him
00:05:17 <Dot> you are qualified for that now
00:06:51 <skrm> been thinking about it
00:07:01 <skrm> ill probably have to take it to the union
00:07:27 <Dot> blarg
00:07:46 <DuB`> San Fran Dva player nevix just went two whole maps (both sides) without dying once :O
00:07:56 <DuB`> Finally got a death in map 3 lol
00:08:34 <Crisium> whoa
00:09:05 <skrm> ill have to flag down the local chapter leader tomorrow morning and see if we can sort it out dot, if not i'd have to make an actual case and all that
00:13:03 <Crisium> hell hath no fury like a scorned skrm
00:13:17 <Dot> that sounds lie a lot of hassle and like it can cause probems skrm :/
00:13:21 <Dot> good luck
00:13:32 <Crisium> gotta get paid
00:13:36 <Dot> indeed
00:13:59 <Dot> sucks its been done to skram
00:14:02 <skrm> Its very difficult for employers in this country to fire you
00:15:10 <skrm> im not worried about losing my job but i am thinking hard about doing something else
00:15:44 <Camail> you have 2 seasons of experience as a farmhand
00:16:13 <Crisium> i too have thought about quiting my dull city office job and going off to the farm
00:16:42 <Dot> you need to inherit a farm first though
00:16:44 <skrm> I have irl experience as a farmhand and its the worst fucking job ever
00:17:23 <Camail> yea but being tired is fun in game
00:17:28 <Camail> it's just a bar
00:17:34 <Camail> not the pain and aches of your real body
00:17:42 <Crisium> do they farm reindeer in your country skrm
00:17:42 <skrm> pretty much haha
00:17:57 <skrm> yeah cris, up north they do
00:18:05 <Crisium> do that for a living
00:18:13 <skrm> absolutely not
00:18:30 <Dot> skram hates any animal larger than a duck
00:18:32 <Camail> or you can cut your eyelids with a razor
00:18:38 <Crisium> ducks are pretty awesome
00:19:03 <Camail> they're aggressive as fuck
00:19:05 <Camail> at least some are
00:19:11 <Camail> oh wait no, thats geese
00:19:23 <skrm> haha yes
00:19:48 <Dot> ducks are passive agressive
00:20:25 <skrm> someone near where i live have alpacas
00:20:36 <skrm> they're the softest of all the things and I want one
00:21:07 <Dot> there is a place near here with some llamas
00:21:14 <Dot> they look soft, but those eyes
00:22:22 <Crisium> alpacas are funny looking
00:22:26 <skrm> i dont remember which ones were the mean ones
00:24:39 <DuB`> Nothing beats Peanut the Bun in softness!
00:25:03 <DuB`> Confirmed as I cuddled him just now
00:25:33 <Dot> later dubs
00:29:05 <Bio> POENS
00:29:08 <Bio> hi
00:29:12 <Camail> sup
00:29:22 <Bio> yo
00:29:25 <Camail> so turns out you can upgrade your houses individually
00:29:31 <Camail> so 1. thats a lot of wood
00:29:33 <Bio> thats p neat
00:29:56 <Camail> 2. we can just pay 4.5k for the wood
00:36:33 <Bio> that seems reasonable
00:37:33 <Camail> 3. i am getting married in 3 days
00:37:43 <Camail> penny is 'bout to get wifed
00:38:00 <Camail> dunno how it will handle multiple ppl
00:38:24 <Bio> hope I didn't miss Leah's Birfday
00:38:28 <Bio> are we in winter yet
00:43:20 <Camail> no we arent
00:43:35 <Camail> i think fall 16 or something
00:44:02 <Camail> 15, actually, because 16th is harvest
00:44:14 <Camail> and we didnt want to do any important events
00:44:28 <Camail> er, 16th is the fair
00:56:16 <Bio> k
02:12:13 <Crisium> so new PTR.  Ana's shots ignore full health teammates... so both a buff and a nerf, depending on when you want to preheal =\
02:12:33 <Crisium> also not PTR yet, but they said they want to change Ana ammo size to 14.  at least thats a buff
02:30:21 <skrm> Camail: you fucks missed abigails birthday
02:30:57 <Crisium> now she will never play vidya games with you again
02:31:20 <skrm> nope
02:31:58 <Camail> we were hoping you wouldnt notice
02:32:30 <skrm> good job on that
02:34:35 <Camail> we noticed way too late
02:34:39 <Camail> like a week
02:35:10 <Camail> hope is not lost
02:35:38 <Camail> you cant marry during winter anyway so its basically like nothing happened 
02:35:58 <Crisium> you can marry during winter, i did
02:36:02 <Crisium> you jsut cant buy the thing then
02:36:05 <Crisium> have to buy earlier

02:54:56 <Camail> on the plus side, we can probably win the grange thing?
02:59:38 <Camail> pink cake, cloth, super cucumber, melon,diamond,pumpkin, the rest can be fish or something
02:59:52 <Bio> ez
03:00:00 <Bio> i can put in a FUCKIN MAYO
03:00:15 <Camail> mayo is worth 3 points
03:01:31 <Bio> not my mayo cam
03:01:35 <Bio> mine is worth 69
03:01:39 <Camail> pls
03:01:58 <Camail> oh wait you dont need the items to be unique
03:02:06 <Camail> so we can fill the rest with gold pumpkins
03:14:08 <Camail> ice slips are also good fish for it
03:16:00 <Camail> skrm you can get a fedora at the fair
03:16:13 <Camail> I'd much prefer that over your other...decision
03:18:38 <Camail> lmfao, apparently there are only two genders in stardew under the hood, male and not-male
03:18:51 <Camail> where if they aren't flagged as male it assumes they are female
03:23:12 <Bio> festival episode boys
03:32:09 <Camail> yasha
03:32:13 <Camail> you adorable big baby
03:33:56 <Camail> YASHA
03:34:29 <Bio> MUSCLE BATTLE
03:38:40 <Camail> she had adv on that entire time she was totally gonna win
03:38:41 <Camail> was fun tho
03:40:24 <Camail> awwww we got another barb that cant read
04:17:51 <Camail> hi darb
04:18:02 <Camail> critical role is a filler episode
04:18:09 <Camail> you can catch the second half
04:18:16 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry
04:18:31 <DuB`> Eh, I have lots of free time
04:18:35 <DuB`> Will watch the whole thing later
04:25:29 <Camail> also skram rightfully scolded me for forgetting about abigail's birthday
04:25:34 <Camail> so we gotta make it up to him somehow
04:26:35 <DuB`> Upgrade his house!
04:26:39 <DuB`> Wait we can't do that
04:26:45 <DuB`> Prepare the materials for house upgrades!
04:27:39 <Camail> yea, it's probably gonna be easier to just buy the wood, thats 1800 wood for all of you
04:28:14 <Camail> and we need to be sure to farm the secret grove if we ever want kids
04:29:16 <DuB`> Abigail loves punkin and amethyst, we have lots of those
04:29:18 <DuB`> ezez
04:33:27 <DuB`> And cris said you can get married but can't buy the amulet in winter? Have to see if one of use can buy an extra
04:33:34 <DuB`> And then he won't have to wait
04:33:48 <Bio> I wouldn't mind having an amulet either
04:35:07 <Camail> well i cant because I already gave it
04:35:56 <Camail> pretty sure its one per person
04:36:02 <DuB`> Aw
04:36:03 <Bio> rip
04:36:16 <Bio> need to farm up fishing
04:36:23 <DuB`> Well
04:36:26 <Bio> mines still like 2 or some shit
04:36:44 <DuB`> If someone gets foraging lv9 we can force rain->mariner spawn even during winter :P
04:37:00 <Camail> yea but we still need like, lots of money
04:37:54 <Camail> if we buy all the wood thats 58k just to get the upgraded houses
04:38:00 <Camail> then another 20k for pendants
04:38:25 <Camail> it was an unforseen expense
04:38:43 <Camail> we 100% need to get the 25k bundle for winter or else we will have nothing to do
04:38:58 <Camail> and dub has been waiting patiently
04:39:00 <Bio> fish 5ever
04:41:12 <Camail> if we wanted to buy everything we've had our eyes on its 133k, so we'll have to make some decisions
04:41:36 <Camail> so probably no damage% rings
04:42:14 <Camail> having two people in the dungeon will be more than enough to compensate
04:44:51 <Camail> also stardrops dont affect everyone which is mega dumb
04:45:32 <Camail> i would like at least one

15:49:35 <Zounds> shitposting on reddit
15:49:51 <CockRoach|42> pls
15:52:57 <Zounds> Well actually i'm just regular posting
15:55:03 <CrisPone> Yes zounds
15:55:35 <CrisPone> Reddit is the worst
15:55:50 <Zounds> In general I agree
15:55:56 <Zounds> Though certain subreddits are alright
15:56:03 <Zounds> I like the server specific planetside ones
15:56:05 <CrisPone> They don't even realize the Ana PTR change has huge draw backs
15:56:17 <Zounds> and the main planetside sub is okay by reddit standards
15:57:29 <Zounds> Blizzard game subreddirs like Overwatch and WoW are the worst though
15:57:53 <Zounds> Sob stories and bronze potgs all day long
15:58:24 <Zounds> DAE too much toxicity in Overwatch?
15:58:28 <Zounds> PSA don't harass girl gamers

16:00:29 <Crisium> another juicy defran torb highlight
16:01:28 <Zounds> The competitive overwatch reddit is slightly better

16:02:46 <Crisium> but i like to read them to get a fix on the general populations thoughts
16:02:59 <Zounds> comp ow is clearly biased towards super mega skill flankerbro tracers
16:03:15 <Crisium> at least both have united over brig being bullshit
16:03:28 <Crisium> obv theres debate on how to fix her
16:04:03 <Zounds> Yeah :P
16:04:04 <Crisium> i wish i could permaignore anyone who thought the mercy nerfs in January were overnerfing
16:04:14 <Crisium> she is now the mosted used healer in OWL again
16:04:48 <Crisium> people screamed how she would be useless
16:04:52 <Crisium> the fools, the lot of them
16:04:53 <Zounds> Indeed she is still amazing
16:04:55 <Crisium> now, back on my high horse
16:04:57 <Zounds> However i'm sorta okay with it for now
16:05:05 <Zounds> She doesn't ruin the game like she used to
16:05:25 <Crisium> shes not overpowering anymore for sure.
16:05:35 <Crisium> but some thought she would be useless
16:05:44 <skram> You mean like Ana?
16:05:51 <Crisium> Yes
16:06:00 <Crisium> did you see the Ana PTR change?
16:06:09 <Crisium> it's a change that gold level players would think of
16:06:17 <Crisium> they dont realize it has huge drawbacks too
16:06:28 <skram> The one where you cant hit full HP targets?
16:06:33 <Crisium> yea
16:07:06 <skram> yeah im not sure about that one
16:07:08 <Crisium> i tried it on PTR.  it's... just another duel edged sword thing
16:07:18 <Dot> skram!
16:07:28 <Crisium> it's great for DPS Ana's who want to frag out.  for pre-healing is so useful, but thats out now
16:07:38 <skram> they also increased ammo to 14 right?
16:07:40 <skram> dot!
16:07:53 <Crisium> they have not increased Ammo yet, but they said they will in a later PTR
16:08:14 <Crisium> MFW changed a simple numerical value from 10-14 takes longer than changing shot interactions
16:08:22 <skram> haha
16:08:23 <Crisium> hehe
16:09:09 <skram> The shot thing doesnt seem like something that would make Ana more useful
16:09:23 <reification> something something technology not there yet?
16:09:57 <Zounds> 2 grenades
16:10:06 <Crisium> Zounds wants Ana to be junkrat

16:10:35 <Crisium> it would make her overpowered again, if thats what people want lmao
16:10:36 <Zounds> I saw a suggestion that sounded kinda fun where ana shots would anti heal the target for the duration of the DoT
16:10:44 <Zounds> though that doesn't actually help her heal people or stay alive
16:10:50 <reification> ana shots clearly need splash
16:11:09 <Zounds> hi Camail 
16:11:14 <Camail> hello
16:11:17 <Crisium> that would help her frag out at least zounds
16:11:34 <Crisium> even the payload heals enough to make it 4 shots to kill someone
16:11:42 <Camail> give her shield bash
16:11:49 <Crisium> yes, please
16:11:54 <Crisium> sleep dart and shield bash
16:12:00 <Crisium> and 2 grenades
16:12:04 <reification> and primal rage
16:12:04 <skram> heal grenades also stun enemies
16:12:07 <Crisium> ^
16:12:34 <skram> and also allies
16:12:42 <skram> nothing better than fucking up everything
16:13:16 <Zounds> reification: 50% Target based AoE healing on a hit could be nice actually
16:13:20 <Camail> if blizzard learned anything from having mei's wall be unbreakable, never make friendly fire mechanics
16:15:39 <Zounds> it would even let her heal herself a bit
16:15:48 <Zounds> shoot a guy standing next to you and the AoE heal hits yourself
16:16:40 <Zounds> Though it's not particularly snipery to ram your rifle up a teammates butt to heal yourself
16:22:24 <Dot> hows your face skram
16:23:12 <Zounds> you should try the new hanzo next time we stack skram
16:23:22 <Zounds> he is fun
16:23:34 <Dot> skrams a hanzo main
16:26:21 <Zounds> Nobody can match my hanzo locking speed
16:26:26 <Zounds> at least if you ask Camail 
16:26:39 <Crisium> Zounds, Hanzo might be your best
16:26:39 <Camail> tru
16:26:40 <Crisium> become main
16:27:13 <Zounds> I do plan to play the new one a fair bit
16:28:51 <Zounds> The first time you wall climb and use the new leap to jump backwards off the wall and headshot a guy is a magical one
16:29:50 <Zounds> bless blizz for when they decided to let you keep your bow drawn during wall climbs all that time ago

16:50:52 <DuB`> If you say so.

18:54:36 <skram> yeah Dot what the h e c k is this
18:56:25 <Dot> hi skram
18:56:43 <skram> hey buddy

19:06:31 <skram> really?
19:06:36 <skram> i wasnt
19:06:57 <Dot> ok
19:07:04 <Dot> just wanted to check
19:07:09 <Dot> what you up to?
19:07:44 <Zounds> calm down skram
19:07:47 <skram> im gonna try to do an overwatch
19:08:09 <Dot> gl hest
19:08:20 <Zounds> glgl
19:08:42 <Dot> look at this dorf skram https://i.imgur.com/xSmOBtx.jpg
19:08:46 <Dot> i know you like dorfs
19:10:11 <skram> you know me so well
19:18:53 <CrisPone> I'll be on in like 20
19:19:35 <BioBRB> i bek
19:19:38 <Bio> hi
19:19:43 <Bio> new phone
19:19:44 <Dot> hi boi
19:19:45 <Bio> who dis
19:20:11 <Camail> pls
19:20:28 <Camail> new slay the spire character is shit unless you have all the unlocks
19:20:39 <Camail> i imagine it's fun for casual players who dont care about losing
19:20:59 <Camail> but the daily challenges let you play with the full card pool and I'm 2/2 on those but 0/4 with the limited pool
19:23:34 <DuB`> Oof
19:23:39 <DuB`> Pay 20% more rent to halve commute?
19:23:42 <DuB`> ach
19:24:18 <Camail> how long is your commute gonna be
19:26:20 <Dot> and depending on cost of travel vs amount of rent
19:27:27 <DuB`> Actually nvm the farther one is closer than it looked on map
19:27:34 <DuB`> 20min bus + 5min walk
19:28:15 <Camail> thats very doable
19:28:48 <Camail> how about you give me that extra 20% and I'll allow you to talk to me while you're on the bus
19:29:12 <DuB`> Close place is 15min walk
19:30:33 <Camail> meh, going from 30 minutes to 15 minutes doesn't seem worth it to me? but that's just my thing
19:31:04 <DuB`> Would also avoid bus
19:31:21 <Dot> how much would the bus cost a month?
19:31:33 <DuB`> Less worried about bus pass cost or more the hassle
19:31:49 <Camail> the bus is a negative because of the schedule, and maybe the bus sucks
19:31:52 <DuB`> Bus times, etc
19:31:53 <DuB`> Yeah
19:33:06 <Dot> american bus prices arnt nearly as high as UK then
19:33:09 <Camail> there is a point where avoiding the bus is worth it, but I've taken buses and trains for a long time so it's w/e for me
19:33:52 <Crisium> bus every day to and from work here
19:33:59 <Crisium> prefer to driving
19:34:00 <Camail> the difference in rent far outweighs the monthly/yearly pass cost, dot
19:34:19 <Dot> thast not the case here cam :/
19:34:58 <Camail> transportation is kinda america's low key best thing
19:35:01 <Crisium> $97.50 in my city per month for unlimitted bus
19:35:39 <Camail> and sometimes either companies or the cities themselves give discounts for people using buses as a means to get to work everyday
19:36:53 <Camail> it all comes down to when the morning bus is
19:37:13 <Camail> if it ends up adding time you have to dedicate to waiting for the bus, it might be annoying
19:37:39 <Crisium> oh, skrm is doing placements
19:37:41 <Crisium> gl pon
19:37:48 <skram> wanna join
