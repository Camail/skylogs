19:27:39 <Zounds> Speaking of secret butt fun
19:27:43 <Zounds> hi phear
19:27:48 <Phearlock> 0w0
19:31:24 <CockRoach|42> :)
19:31:57 <Camail> if we get 5 we can play csgo, any more or less and we should probably not
19:32:18 <Bio> I'm leaving in an hour for work rip
19:32:32 <Camail> the main difference between the two games is that randos in cs get mad at stacks for not talking in game
19:34:05 <Zounds> I can't play for a few hours sorry
19:34:34 <Zounds> they get mad in OW too in comp :)
19:35:36 <Zounds> Easily solved by talking in game though
19:35:40 <Camail> ah, makes sense
19:35:56 <Camail> another reason not to play comp
19:40:54 <Zounds> For the most part people are pretty chill as long as you're at least in the channel and can listen
19:41:40 <Zounds> Timing dives and such can be difficult without communicating though
19:46:04 <Camail> i prefer using my hanzo ult before the grav push then feel sad and leaving mid match
19:46:55 <Camail> Bio  when do u stop the work thing
19:47:31 <Bio> pretty late
19:47:39 <Bio> hoping to be back for critrole
19:47:42 <Bio> but prolly not
19:47:56 <Camail> welp
19:48:39 <Bio> sry m8
19:52:54 <Bio> haven't played cs in so long
19:54:04 <DuB`> Apparently there was an update like 6 months ago that made it so you can free-look while holding up reinhardt shield by left clicking
19:54:11 <DuB`> And I had no idea
19:57:34 <Camail> that seems useful in some edge cases
19:57:45 <Camail> but ultimately kinda meh?

22:50:15 <Crisium> i got into a comp game with barcode
22:50:22 <Crisium> 3 GMs on my team, made me feel like a big boy
22:50:25 <Crisium> EZ win actually, I got 43% healing as Moira
22:54:33 <Camail> nice
22:59:06 <Micen|Droid> I wish I could OW. But I can't 
23:02:25 <Crisium> step 1, lower sensitivity gradually until it's too low (then raise it back 1 level)
23:02:41 <Crisium> step 2, watch the kill feed and know when to advance, retreat, use ults, save ults
23:02:55 <Crisium> step 3, have experience from playing / watching streams
23:02:57 <Crisium> thats all
23:03:22 <DuB`> (Micen's internet is out and he actually CAN'T play OW)
23:03:24 <DuB`> :P
23:03:35 <Crisium> step 0, internet :P
23:03:54 <Crisium> also having a PC helps
23:04:07 <Crisium> no android port yet
23:11:12 <Micen|Droid> Get on pubg's level blizz
23:11:18 <DuB`> Hehe
23:11:38 <DuB`> I want to try OW on console just once in my life
23:11:59 <DuB`> Would be so interesting trying a game I've gotten used to over 700 hours on an entirely different interface
23:12:33 <DuB`> Boston's first post-DK game also has to be against NYXL... rip
23:12:38 <DuB`> I don't see this going well
23:14:17 <Crisium> im terribad with analog stick aiming
23:14:42 <Crisium> if i had console id have to be a winston, rein, mercy main
23:15:29 <Micen|Droid> Can't even watch. My 4g is too weak to stream it b
23:15:33 <DuB`> I was really good at Crysis2 on ps3
23:15:51 <Crisium> my peak analog aiming was the halo 2, halo 3 days
23:16:00 <Crisium> and even then i was never incredible
23:16:02 <DuB`> Was just a dumb highschool kid but somehow figured out how to wreck in that game
23:18:22 <Camail> i remember having a blast in halo 1 and 2
23:18:32 <Camail> then i played on a friends 360 once and wanted to kill myself
23:19:16 <DuB`> :o
23:19:33 <Camail> no it was halo 4, or w/e they started calling them
23:19:38 <Camail> i could FEEL the aim assist
23:19:41 <Camail> it felt dirty
23:19:47 <Crisium> never played any after 3
23:20:00 <Crisium> 3 was the same engine as 2, so it played the same
23:24:05 <DuB`> Striker > SBB :O
23:28:13 <Camail> lmfao my drivers license just came in the mail...i havent updated my information in 8 years
23:28:24 <Camail> some of these stats are...not true
23:28:39 <Crisium> they dont make you go to DMV every time to renew?
23:28:45 <Camail> no cuz i drive well
23:28:51 <Camail> so i just click a button
23:28:52 <Crisium> must be a state thing
23:28:57 <Camail> probably
23:29:07 <Crisium> we are slaved into going to the glorious DMV line every time
23:29:10 <DuB`> o ya I need to do that
23:30:02 <Camail> my height is listed as 5'8", which must've been put down when i was 16
23:30:51 <Camail> and the picture is like 8 years old too...and it says i weigh 115, which is very not true
23:31:01 <Camail> about 45 lbs off
23:31:10 <Crisium> update your info scrub
23:31:17 <DuB`> Haha
23:32:02 <DuB`> Hmm
23:32:13 <DuB`> I can do online renewal but have to send in a mail request the first time
23:32:18 <DuB`> Or something?
23:32:37 <Camail> try online renwal first
23:32:42 <Camail> if you have a number that hey gave you
23:32:49 <Camail> in IL they let you input it

23:43:15 <Camail> they are slow release bullets
23:43:28 <Camail> they will find you in 3-6 years
23:43:51 <Runbunny> Does this qualify as a death threat?
23:44:38 <Camail> sure but you cant act on it
23:44:46 <Camail> does anyone want to play any particular fps?
23:44:51 <Camail> dunno who is around that wants to play
