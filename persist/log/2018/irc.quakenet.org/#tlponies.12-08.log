07:34:00 <skram> i accidentally parked my car in a ditch
07:34:28 <Camail> ...how?
07:35:10 <skram> well its been snowing a lot and the roads are very slippery
07:35:24 <Camail> oh, so you ran off the road
07:35:32 <Camail> yea i've done that
07:35:46 <Camail> it was that or rear end the dude in front of me
07:35:56 <skram> they hadnt plowed the road to my house so i had to back out on a bit of a hill, and the car started sliding from a standstill into a ditch
07:36:03 <skram> not very dramatic but very inconvenient
07:36:06 <Camail> rip
07:36:15 <Camail> did you shovel yourself out
07:36:19 <Camail> or is that your new car home
07:37:23 <skram> some nice lads in a 4x4 dragged me out, parked it by the side of the road
07:37:27 <skram> it'll be fine maybe
07:37:42 <Camail> snow is soft, i'm sure it'll work out
07:38:16 <skram> shoveling it out wouldnt have helped, it was stuck on the bottom wishbone or the oil pan probably
07:38:19 <skram> might be fucked who knows
07:39:21 <Camail> well, if the oil pan was fucked you'd know, right
07:39:53 <skram> well maybe
07:40:08 <skram> you can fuck it just a lil bit so it takes a while for all the oil to escape
07:40:52 <Camail> the subtle fucks are often the deadliest
07:41:01 <skram> truth
07:43:58 <DuB`> Oh dear skram D:
07:49:28 <Camail> i want a rimworld mod that gets rid of all the guns and robots
07:49:32 <Camail> i want big tracks of land

08:51:21 <Camail> the key is to be aware of the map
08:51:43 <Camail> you have wall hacks, which means you can have free looting when you need it
08:51:55 <Camail> and if you're lucky you can almost pinpoint where people are
08:54:43 <Camail> additionally something that mgiht help is that you should almost 100% being buying armor or a knife as soon as you touch down, depending on whats around you

13:09:49 <Dot`> the reif horse
13:10:57 <Dot`> eating 6 crumpets has been as bad an idea as i suspected
13:16:33 <reification> that sounds a bit gluttonous dot
13:16:54 <Dot`> well they should have been eaten by the 6th but i kept forgetting D:
13:20:40 <reification> pc still won't behave dot
13:20:46 <reification> it's very frustrating
13:21:02 <Dot`> whats it doing? is internt just dropping or is the whole pc haivn gissues?
13:21:48 <reification> worst is sometimes won't boot past bios at all just black screen :(
13:22:02 <reification> other times poor performance
13:22:27 <reification> some crashes (overwatch)
13:22:37 <reification> and then sometimes it is work fine
13:23:14 <Dot`> you got a new graphics card recently right?
13:23:27 <Dot`> because it sounds like a PSU issue
13:23:35 <Dot`> and a new card might be drawing too much from it
13:24:16 <reification> yeah that is recent change 
13:24:40 <Dot`> you know what size PSU your running?
13:24:43 <reification> i was gonna just try putting the old gfx card back and seeing what happened
13:25:03 <Dot`> it COULD be a factory defect with the card
13:25:08 <Dot`> try the old one
13:25:28 <Dot`> and check you have a large enough PSU for the new card
13:25:42 <reification> i'm sure i checked before
13:26:02 <reification> lets see
13:26:11 <reification> have to go sort food now
13:26:15 <Dot`> if you did it could just be the PSU going, cant handle what it should
13:26:35 <Dot`> but freezing on startup is often PSU
13:26:52 <Dot`> enjoy food, dont eat 6 crumpets
14:25:15 <reification> psu is corsair VS550 https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/Power/vs-series-config/p/CP-9020097-UK
