07:34:56 <skrm> the national train museum got a job out for a steam train mechanic person
07:35:03 <skrm> i think i wanna put my application in
07:35:08 <Dot`> do it
07:35:54 <skrm> only problem is that it pays like 20k ¬£ less than my current job
07:35:55 <skrm> but
07:35:56 <skrm> TRAINZ

07:40:31 <Dot`> thats a lot of money :/
07:40:39 <DuB`> G'morning dot!
07:40:43 <Dot`> Dub <¬£
07:40:45 <Dot`> <3
07:41:22 <Dot`> is that a month skram?
07:41:31 <skrm> yes of course
07:41:47 <Dot`> well thats about 50 times more than i make a month atm
07:42:07 <Dot`> i dont work in such large numbers, so it wasnt obvious to me
07:42:16 <skrm> haha
07:42:25 <skrm> no its per year of course
07:42:29 <skrm> before taxes etc etc
07:43:20 <Dot`> its still a fair amount, but trains...
07:43:29 <DuB`> Haha
07:43:32 <Dot`> is there any roo for advancement in the train job?
07:44:55 <Dot`> i would say apply skram, go and talk to them, if you get the job you can always turn it down
07:45:41 <skrm> probably not Dot`
07:46:16 <skrm> And this museum is the only place in all of norway that would have the need for a guy with steam locomotive experience
07:47:47 <DuB`> O ya
07:47:50 <DuB`> New apartment is nice
07:48:00 <skrm> cool cool cool

07:48:19 <skrm> ooh
07:48:29 <DuB`> Brother is roommate, the other room in apartment is my best friend and one random
07:48:43 <DuB`> Have four other good friends living in another apt in the same building
07:48:45 <DuB`> Gonna be a fun year
07:48:47 <Dot`> but skram is your best friend
07:49:05 <skrm> How do you know thats not where I moved Dot` 
07:49:09 <DuB`> ;D
