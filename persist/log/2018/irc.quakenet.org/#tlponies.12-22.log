22:24:18 <Runbunny> Isn't it first space then not so space but kinda anyways?
22:26:18 <Camail> the intro scene is of you leaving space, aggressively, downward
22:26:35 <skram> aggressively leaving space
22:30:46 <Dot`> i should play it a bit more
22:31:13 <Camail> to me, there's no other game that makes you afraid, but then lets you conquer your fear
22:31:20 <Camail> purely with knowledge and exposure
22:31:43 <Camail> scary things become commonplace, or you find ways to work around them
22:32:02 <Camail> and it's special for a game to organically make me feel those things
