07:09:48 <Camail> it's not even super late
07:09:50 <Camail> its only 2
07:40:36 <Rawr|Fone> Go to bed camail
07:40:46 <Camail> no u
07:41:14 <Dot`_> hows tyranny?

07:45:54 <Dot`> <3
07:45:58 <Rawr|Fone> <3
07:46:05 <Dot`> how are you today?
07:46:16 <Camail> it was fun, really fun
07:46:18 <Rawr|Fone> Great!
07:46:24 <Rawr|Fone> How is the dot today
07:46:33 <Dot`> need more coffee rawr
07:46:45 <Rawr|Fone> Coffee is the worst
07:46:49 <Camail> it's like, the ending of tyranny was as good as the ending of poe1, but for gameplay reasons and not mechanical ones
07:46:56 <Camail> errr
07:47:04 <Camail> by mechanical i mean narrative
07:56:10 <Dot`> is Graveyeard keeper the new stardew valley
07:56:12 <Dot`> with more death
08:03:41 <Dot`> Hey cam, thoughts on playing in a dnd west marches game? i think we have enough ppl
08:08:41 <Camail> yea i'd be cool with that
08:08:44 <Camail> are you dming?
08:08:57 <Dot`> yea, was thinking of trying one
08:09:55 <Dot`> the start would be rough, i havnt dmed an amazing amount, but i tihnk the style of player focused scheduling would work for us
08:11:35 <Camail> i feel like watching games is almost as useful, if you actually make a point to learn from people
08:11:52 <Dot`> hmm true
08:12:25 <Camail> and watching multiple DMs is even better, so if you've given it some thought and reflected on the multitude of dm styles then i'd trust you have a good grasp
08:12:59 <Camail> I've learned some really important things just from watching chris perkins and mercer DM
08:13:07 <Camail> and contrasting their styles
08:13:25 <Dot`> i havnt seen any chris perkins stuff in a while
08:13:37 <Dot`> mainly latley its been adma koebal and mercer
08:15:38 <Camail> but in the end, the most important lessons are the ones that excite you, that's where you get your style
08:16:09 <Camail> style really is just instinctual preference, it all comes down to you looking at a thing, and either liking or disliking what it does
08:16:38 <Camail> now i gotta start thinking about what to play tho
08:16:53 <Camail> I'll be nice, i was kinda a pain in the ass in ZKs game
08:16:56 <Dot`> so far i have you and skram if it does happen
08:17:23 <Camail> ritual caster + mask of many faces, and he never read the phb, that was rough
08:17:39 <Dot`> haha, im debating start lvl as well, lvl 1 is traditional for west marches, but 2 or 3 might be better
08:17:45 <Camail> but dot, skram is gross
08:17:50 <Camail> why do i have to play with that gross boy
08:18:05 <Dot`> well you at least know you will have a barb 
08:18:08 <Dot`> :P
08:18:17 <Dot`> one trick pony
08:18:49 <Dot`> in my LMoP game i got him to play a cleric, but now he is back to barbarians
08:19:23 <Dot`> even though he pretty much soloed Venomfang as a cleric
08:21:40 <Dot`> if you are looking already at characters cam, any book is fine, UA is PROBABLY fine but just check, though i trust your judgment
08:21:54 <Dot`> all dnd books https://rpg.rem.uz/Dungeons%20%26%20Dragons/D%26D%205th%20Edition/
08:22:19 <Camail> I don't think I'll go too crazy
08:22:41 <Camail> maybe the fighter with superiority dice, i've seen that be kinda fun
08:22:53 <Camail> fighters are so good
08:23:00 <Dot`> they are
08:23:26 <Dot`> even with the extra subclasses from Xanathars i think battlemaster is still my favourite fighter
08:24:50 <Dot`> but a high lvl Eldritch knight is sometihng i would play in a 1 shot
08:25:20 <Camail> hmmm, if i do a fighter i'd probably go with the soft-spoken bodyguard kind of character
08:25:33 <Camail> i bit off more than i could chew with my other guy, who i literally forgot the name of
08:26:02 <Camail> not gonna get fancy
08:26:18 <Dot`> keep in mind for backstory, west marches is a town beyond the edge of civlisation
08:26:37 <Dot`> you dont end up there if you have another choice kind of thing
08:26:42 <Dot`> or your just weird i guess
08:27:24 <Dot`> and im sure the guy who came up with West marches idea is american, becuase of te west part
08:27:50 <Dot`> as a 'EU' person, east is the direction you travel to expler new lands
08:27:55 <Dot`> explore*
08:45:15 <Camail> but that's where the russians are
08:45:22 <Camail> that's too scary, even in dnd
08:45:50 <Dot`> everyone that has tried to push east has died, its true
08:45:59 <Dot`> west at least had some success
08:49:30 <Dot`> i was tihnking cam of cutting background fetures, they are either completly useless or plain broken in this game style
08:50:03 <Dot`> outlander for instance, the game is about exploration and keeping a player map that sometimes ends up wrong
08:50:09 <Dot`> this just ognore all that
08:50:36 <Camail> i'm fine with throwing away any and all background mechanics, i dont need them
08:51:02 <Camail> and skram doesnt seem to care much about characterization so he's probably cool with it
08:51:18 <Dot`> well you can get the skills and profs from one
08:51:29 <Dot`> and even use the customisation rule
08:51:30 <Camail> kk
08:52:18 <Dot`> and its your choice, but skram will probably want to roll on Xanathars:this is your life
08:52:45 <Dot`> it gives key background things you can build off  and soemtimes free stuff
08:56:25 <Dot`> im undecided on stats, for a long campagn im for stadard array but this is probably going to have more character death
08:57:11 <Dot`> probably 4d6 drop, do that three times and pick one
08:57:28 <Dot`> but that seems so soft
