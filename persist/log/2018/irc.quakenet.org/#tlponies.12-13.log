18:39:46 <DuB`> Whassup?
18:40:10 <Camail> skram is complaining about all the hentai dot watches
18:40:15 <Camail> i think it's just fine
18:40:38 <DuB`> I don't think it's quite at the level of being a problem -- yet.
18:42:11 <skrm> well his eyes are hurting
18:44:30 <skrm> seems a bit excessive, no?
18:45:02 <DuB`> Perhaps
18:50:15 <Camail> but his eyes always hurt
18:51:16 <skrm> yes because he's always watching hentai

19:06:43 <Camail> hmmm
19:08:05 <Camail> 11
19:11:36 <DuB`> ???
19:12:44 <Camail> i hjave spoken
19:17:28 <DoT|Phone> I had a nap
19:18:58 <DoT|Phone> maybe it shall continue
19:19:06 <DuB`> I should also nap
19:26:35 <Camail> dot if you nap too lonmg its a sleep
19:27:02 <Camail> then so long sleep schedule
19:27:32 <Camail> also dub where are you in CR
19:29:58 <DuB`> e40
19:33:30 <skrm> no napping
19:33:41 <Runbunny> Wait. What kind of scale is that?
19:33:44 <skrm> only spess
19:33:50 <skrm> its simple, anders
19:34:08 <skrm> rawr is the least amount of weeb in this place, you're the maximum amount of weeb
19:34:11 <skrm> dub is you+1
19:34:52 <Runbunny> How am I weeb?
19:35:26 <Camail> RUN
19:35:27 <Camail> BUN
19:35:30 <Camail> HOW ARE YOU NOT WEEB
19:35:40 <Runbunny> Ahh okay fair point.
19:36:03 <Camail> and just becuse you are a 10 doesnt mean you are the most weeb in the world
19:36:11 <Camail> its just that you were the highest on the relative scale
19:36:21 <Runbunny> I see.
19:36:37 <Camail> there are people whoa re so weeby that its basically an illness
19:36:54 <Runbunny> Dub can be me plus one any day.
19:36:56 <Camail> obsession with the Other culture can get pretty nutty
19:37:44 <skrm> too much of anything is usually an illness cam
19:38:19 <Camail> are you saying we could have too much of you?
19:38:20 <Camail> impossible

19:59:34 <Camail> c2e~25 spoilers, obviously
19:59:45 <Camail> but nothing from anything you havent seen
20:01:31 <Camail> e26, i was close
20:08:34 <Runbunny> That's pretty cool.
20:12:04 <skrm> cooler than being ice cold?
20:22:00 <Runbunny> I wouldn't know Jonas. What do you define "ice cold" as? Just below 0 celsius or lower?
20:23:30 <skrm> as cool as ice, anders
20:25:40 <Camail> Runbunny  depends on the atmospheric pressure
20:31:22 <Runbunny> That is only the melting point, if I recall.
20:31:40 <Runbunny> and boiling point for that matter.
20:32:21 <skrm> naw
20:32:43 <skrm> freezing point increases slightly as pressure increases
20:32:46 <skrm> to a point
20:35:48 <Runbunny> You can have water below freezing temperature without it freezing. Would you call that ice cold?
20:37:05 <Phearlock>  yeah I'd say so
20:37:20 <Phearlock> It's as cold as naturally ocurring ice
20:40:31 <Runbunny> So about as cool as 0 degrees celsius at 1 atmospheric pressure. Which is like 760 mm of hg or 29.92 inches.
20:40:48 <Runbunny> In that case, yes skram.
20:41:37 <Camail> DuB`  do you see these nerds?
20:44:15 <DuB`> I do now
20:44:20 <DuB`> I was nap, feel much better!
20:44:37 <DuB`> Science is the best.
20:45:57 <DoT|Phone> how are you so good at naps dub
20:46:00 <DoT|Phone> teach me
20:46:58 <DuB`> 1. Be sleepy
20:47:04 <DuB`> 2. Set alarm for 30 minutes
20:47:15 <DuB`> 3. Get in bed or lay back in chair
20:47:16 <DuB`> Done!
20:47:48 <DoT|Phone> but it takes me an hour to fall asleep
20:50:39 <Camail> wtf you nap in your chair
20:50:43 <Camail> thats unreal
20:50:55 <Camail> oh dot the other step is to not have anxiety
20:50:59 <Camail> that helps
20:51:14 <Phearlock> even when I'm relaxed I have trouble falling asleep quickly
20:51:20 <Phearlock> unless I'm like actually sleep deprived
20:53:16 <Runbunny> I suck at sleeping too. 
20:57:28 <DuB`> I take about an hour to fall asleep at night
20:57:32 <DuB`> Naps are different tho
21:01:20 <DuB`> Actually recently I've tried focusing more on breathing all sleep-like and that has helped a lot.
21:05:27 <Runbunny> I find it easier to fall asleep while crying. So I just think of Camail, when trying to sleep.
21:06:02 <Camail> crying isn't the right word in english, run
21:06:13 <Camail> thats the word for tears coming from your eyes
21:06:23 <Camail> wrong liquid, wrong orifice
21:07:39 <Runbunny> ...
21:08:27 <Camail> now i understand why you talk about me in your fake language
21:08:33 <Camail> because you dont actually know english
21:08:35 <Camail> so sad, so sad
21:14:49 <skrm> Runbunny thats supercooling
21:14:52 <skrm> and if you were that cool
21:14:55 <skrm> you'd be supercool
