21:40:56 <Dot`> black*
21:42:10 <Runbunny> I did a assignment on the black death actually, back in high school. I proposed an experiement to test if it was airborne, using rats.
21:42:39 <Runbunny> Needless to say, that experiment broke a few research animal laws.
21:42:45 <Dot`> so you where always about killing small furry animals then
21:43:10 <Runbunny> Apparently.
21:44:51 <Crisium> eek

22:24:11 <Camail> dub you dont have an ethernet port in your room?
22:24:15 <Camail> that seems important
22:24:24 <skram> Since you're in the kitchen anyway DuB`, could you fix me a sandwich
22:24:34 <Camail> sexist
22:25:19 <DuB`> It's barely even my room anymore
22:25:41 <Camail> i i thought you moved already
22:25:41 <Dot`> will you dnd from the kitchen dub?
22:26:14 <Crisium> chef dub
22:27:54 <DuB`> Likely
22:28:32 <DuB`> I may move over to the living room if this doesn't work out, would just mean running an ethernet cable across the kitchen most of the time. :P
22:30:37 <skram> Let me tell you about WiFi
22:30:49 <skram> wireless tubes, DuB`
22:30:57 <DuB`> SLOWER tubes

22:40:26 <Runbunny> DuB`, https://i.imgur.com/2XuCoPp.mp4 I saved this link for you.
22:43:47 <DuB`> You are kind
22:44:02 <DuB`> And dot .telled me some parrotlets!
22:51:31 <Runbunny> Did he link you this DuB` https://i.imgur.com/62Ag0aQ.jpg?
22:51:40 <Runbunny> https://i.imgur.com/62Ag0aQ.jpg fixed
22:52:45 <DuB`> NU
22:52:48 <DuB`> This is also good.
22:59:15 <DuB`> Hmmm
22:59:32 <DuB`> I might just do a big PC ugrade/replacing this summer!
23:02:49 <Runbunny> planning how to spend your real people money already?
23:02:55 <Runbunny> Dot`, skram https://i.imgur.com/4r4n3Mq.mp4
23:03:13 <DuB`> Something like that
23:04:53 <DuB`> Also
23:05:19 <DuB`> I'll fly out to Cali to get there, but some of my family might drive down at the end of the summer to pick me up and enjoy a few days of vacation
23:05:56 <DuB`> Would be nice to not have to pack much for the flight, and there's no way I'd get my whole PC there anyway
23:06:08 <DuB`> Could just buy it there! :P
23:11:23 <Runbunny> :P
23:11:25 <Runbunny> Sleep
23:36:33 <Bio> greet
23:36:36 <Bio> henlo
23:37:14 <DuB`> honlu
23:48:46 <Bio> I hope
23:48:52 <Bio> that everyone enjoyed the stream
23:49:08 <Bio> now imma do other stuffz
23:49:15 <DuB`> I'm sure I would have.
23:49:35 <Phearlock> Grabbed battletech. Game is quite nice so far.
23:49:52 <Phearlock> Feels very Xcom-but-giant-robots
23:51:07 <Phearlock> Though with much less rookie death. Not that difficult yet.
23:51:20 <Dot`> it looks intresting
23:51:22 <Phearlock> Oh and it's also a bit like pokemon
23:51:23 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
23:51:32 <Dot`> but i didnt see much use of cover
23:51:47 <Phearlock> As if you want to salvage a mech the enemy has you want to kill it in a more convoluted way.
23:51:55 <Phearlock> To not damage it so much
23:52:03 <Phearlock> So it's basically pokemon
23:52:09 <Dot`> from what I saw it was liike, stand in field and slugfest
23:52:17 <Dot`> but im guessing there is a lot more to it
23:52:24 <Phearlock> Yeah it's more positioning and who-shoots-what-with-what.
23:52:49 <Phearlock> Some damage reduction abilites, most of the ways to reduce chances to hit involve moving.
23:52:57 <Phearlock> But turning is also part of moving.
23:53:58 <Phearlock> Also since facing affects the spread of incoming damage, you can do stuff like position your guy with a damaged left side so he's trying to only show his right to the enemy etc.
23:55:29 <Phearlock> The game is deep enough that I'm so far having a bunch of fun at least =P
23:55:43 <Phearlock> Animations could be a bit better
23:56:07 <Dot`> i do like giant robots fighting
