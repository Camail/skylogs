00:10:30 <Camail> Just Shapes and Beats looks like such a fun game
00:10:46 <Camail> i hope it does well enough for them to make more content
00:11:12 <Camail> it gives off the feel of a kirby boss fight, to me
00:11:28 <Camail> but you get I FRAMES
00:28:27 <Camail> after watching qc i think galena is only really good on a few maps, her traps are too easy to kill
00:28:56 <Camail> doom guy seems really fun, visor seems fun but only if you're good
00:29:25 <Camail> if you're not playing the item game then where they are really doesnt matter

01:23:27 <Cane> I never underestimate wall hacks any more. They're too good.
01:23:31 <Cane> Item game or not.
01:23:38 <Bio> NEIGH
01:23:41 <Bio> caps
01:24:56 <Cane> Rapha is SO GOOD.
01:24:59 <Cane> Hi Bio.
01:25:05 <Bio> henlo
01:25:08 <Bio> i think
01:25:09 <Cane> Camail, can I have rapha skills pls?
01:25:18 <Bio> imma try to get back to streaming a bit
01:25:29 <Bio> tomorrow afternoon.
01:25:38 <Bio> need to try and get my life on some sort of schedule
01:25:57 <Camail> he's pretty good, cane
01:26:08 <Camail> like, a little bit better than me
01:26:13 <Camail> at LEAST a little bit
01:26:31 <Camail> keeping track of timers is exhausting
01:26:49 <Camail> but honestly it's kinda the linchpin in making quake a good game
01:26:53 <DuB`> Is there quake going? :o
01:27:01 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/rapha
01:27:03 <Cane> I started practicing it hard in UT2K4, it can be pretty miserable.
01:27:15 <Camail> just scrims, but you get to hear comms
01:27:17 <Cane> Never got good at it.
01:27:22 <DuB`> Ah ye

01:28:07 <DuB`> rapha streams make me happy
01:28:09 <Camail> i think i figured out how to do it, but i would then need to drill it into my brain while also trying to think about the...entire game and stuff
01:28:22 <Camail> a lot of it is just repeating the times in your head
01:28:43 <Cane> That's what I had to do. Repeat times in my head. Unfortunately my enemy awareness suffered.
01:28:53 <Cane> Never got to a point where it clicked.
01:29:01 <Camail> and you can kinda FEEL 30 seconds to offload that memorization
01:29:14 <Camail> like, feeling 20 seconds so you can check the clock
01:29:29 <Camail> i get it because you have to multitask like that in fighting games
01:30:16 <Camail> so i know what it feels like to put rely on your lizard brain to do certain things, but it's just soooooo much in quake
01:30:17 <DuB`> 50-17
01:30:30 <Camail> they were playing closer games earlier with other ppl
01:30:38 <Camail> was like 50-45
01:30:48 <Camail> dooi and garpy, or something like that
01:32:19 <Camail> Nioh is a hard videogame
01:32:32 <Camail> once you get to ng+++ it's rough
01:32:36 <Camail> especially the dlc
02:11:07 <DuB`> I've had like a 1.5sec sound desync on twitch all week
02:11:21 <DuB`> Annoying :T
03:19:14 <Camail> have you cleared your cache
04:41:34 <Camail> DuB`  that was a big problem when twitch first switched to html5, and again when chrom implemented the stopping of video when a window goes inactive
04:41:59 <Camail> if i was you i'd look at those two thins, dunno what to do about html5, but maybe there are settings you can mess with in chrome

17:55:21 <skram> Is he gonna be alright though
17:55:31 <skram> Unless he gets bored to death...?
17:56:09 <Cane> He'll be bored to death definitely. Apart from that he should have no lingering symptoms past a week or two, a few months at the worst.
17:56:17 <Cane> It's a rare case where they persist and require long term treatment.
