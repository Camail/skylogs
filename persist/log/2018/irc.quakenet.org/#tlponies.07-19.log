00:01:51 <Camail> rimworld is weird... my misandrist colonist attacked my only male colonist then a year later they start dating
00:02:14 <Camail> guess it takes a village to shoot you, imprison you, and recruit you again to gain some perspective
00:02:14 <Phearlock_> that sounds like rimworld yes
00:03:04 <Camail> well sex gives a good bonus so i encourage this
00:03:12 <Camail> orgies would really make this more efficient

17:47:35 <Zounds> if roll catching sprinting hosts with their army of phantoms flanking them was a bit easier It'd be a bit more fun :P

17:50:33 <Zounds> might run out of embers quickly if the host died too much though

18:04:59 <Zounds> i do alright, tbh if I wanted a 1v1 fight i'd go to the undead match arena and not invade
18:05:32 <Zounds> Just a little frustrating in ds3 when somebody doesn't want to get hit it can be real difficult to punish an estus chug
18:05:54 <Zounds> Not like DS2 where I can just slam a dude when he tries to heal
