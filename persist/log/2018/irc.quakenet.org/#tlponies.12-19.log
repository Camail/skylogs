17:52:24 <Camail> if anyone of you watched two best sisters play, the LP group behind it broke up
17:52:34 <Camail> so RIP any more of those after this next one

18:01:00 <reification> dub why you coming in here making faces?!
18:01:43 <reification> are you done with exams yet?
18:01:56 <DuB`> Last one tomoro morning
18:21:10 <Camail> is your studying complete?
18:28:49 <Runbunny> Camail, is Pillars of Eternity 2 worth it?
18:29:37 <DuB`> Not complete
18:29:39 <Camail> well, depends on what you want
18:29:51 <Runbunny> Well I don't know unless you tell me.
18:29:57 <Camail> dub go study, or i'll sand skram over there to beat you up
18:30:08 <Camail> ok so, did you like pillars 1
18:30:18 <DuB`> I'll gladly not study if it means you pay for skram's plane ticket! :P
18:30:29 <Camail> piallrs 2 is less focused on a single driving narrative
18:30:44 <Camail> did you play tyranny? because i feel like they took some of the narrative style from that game
18:30:55 <skram> ill pay my own dang plane ticket to go over there and put some sense into you, young man
18:31:02 <Camail> lets all go over
18:31:05 <Camail> and just fucking
18:31:07 <Camail> destroy him
18:31:17 <DuB`> And then go SKIING!
18:31:25 <Camail> you need two legs for that
18:31:30 <DuB`> :(
18:31:30 <Camail> so WE'LL go skiing
18:31:55 <Camail> Runbunny  i enjoyed the game, and i LOVED the mechanical changes
18:32:24 <Camail> the multi-classing is great, the sub-classes are great
18:32:36 <Camail> the RPG elements are polished and better than any other game out there
18:33:02 <Camail> the story is kinda meh, it didn't grab me. Partly because there is little to grab onto
18:33:40 <Runbunny> Hmm. 
18:33:48 -!- BioPhone [~androirc@12.33.239.117] has joined #tlponies
18:33:50 <Camail> your character isn't in the focal point of the story like in pillars 1, where you feel really invested because you have an intimate conneciton with the main villain and the problems that crop up are related to your party
18:34:04 <Camail> the problems in pillars are all OUTSIDE your party
18:34:13 <Camail> they were all entertaining, but i didnt care as much
18:34:41 <Camail> they make you feel like you're exploring a foreign country, not like your living in your home country
18:34:58 <Camail> the ending was really cool, they do a lot of exploration into the deeper lore of the universe
18:35:10 <Camail> in general, that is
18:35:15 <BioPhone> L O R E
18:35:22 <BioPhone> Also henlo
18:35:46 <Camail> but nothing aobut pillars 2 really stuck with me, other than the key lore drops
18:35:51 <Camail> hi bio boi
18:35:58 <Camail> but again, boy was it fun
18:36:06 <Camail> sailing around was fun (ship combat sucked dick tho)
18:36:24 <Runbunny> I sure like sucking dick though. 
18:36:24 <BioPhone> I finished the thing I was supposed to finish by Friday today, so work should be ez till the break
18:36:37 <Runbunny> It's on sale right now so I might pick it up.
18:36:49 <Camail> if its on sale, it's worth it
18:37:26 <Camail> you should also play tyranny
18:39:14 <Camail> aanother way of explaining my problem: in poe1 you have a home, and it is INCREDIBLY dense with content, caed nua is really cool, and you feel like you have a place to be, and a fascinating adventure to explore underneath the manor, but...
18:39:45 <Camail> in poe2, you have a ship, that is your home base...and you can upgrade it?
18:40:29 <Camail> and thats it, there's no sense of ownership of the conflicts around you, you are kinda just passing by, helping or hurting people as you chase the FAR more important main quest
18:41:33 <Camail> while i was playing i was engaged, i was enjoying it as it happened, but after the fact? meh
18:41:49 <Camail> also having the CR cast voice many of the characters really ruined the immersion sometimes
18:42:35 <Runbunny> I see.
18:42:56 <Camail> they did well, they are good VAs, but i've heard 800 hours of their voices
18:43:16 <Runbunny> Tyranny is also on sale O:
18:43:50 <Camail> tyranny is a game where this narrative style was more elegantly laced with the story they were telling
18:44:04 <Camail> you are, by design, an emissary that is entering a foreign land
18:44:13 <Camail> and that is very important to the story, at it's core
18:44:28 <Camail> not as much the cas ein poe2
18:45:01 <Camail> the spell casting system is fucking brilliant as well
18:54:53 <Camail> i would really really wants a tyranny 2
