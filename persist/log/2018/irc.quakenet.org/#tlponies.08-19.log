21:36:46 <Phearlock_> And fuzzy at times
21:38:04 <skram> im the druid now ferlok
21:38:09 <skram> you're supposed to be barbarian
21:38:13 <Dot`> cam, you want to be a druid too?
21:38:42 <Camail> i can dress like a druid
21:38:58 <Phearlock_> I haven't really given it too much thought
21:42:34 <Bio> all druid party imo
21:44:08 <Phearlock_> If people were concerned about having multiple people be the same I'm sure they would have announced their pick early in the discord

21:55:02 <Dot`> im sure skram wants a druid friend
21:56:47 <Dot`> you can hug trees together
22:04:50 <Phearlock_> Though, uh, seeing as this is a consistent world. Is there a world?
22:05:03 <Phearlock_> Like, is there a map somewhere?
22:05:19 <Dot`> of 'civilised' land?
22:05:44 <Phearlock_> Like what is the setting?
22:05:49 <Phearlock_> I feel like it assumes one knows
22:05:52 <Phearlock_> And I have no idea haha
22:06:40 <Dot`> the west marches is just dubbed an experiment
22:06:46 <Dot`> there is no set world
22:07:22 <Phearlock_> Ok so there's no resources or anything, and any sort of thing one may want to reference in a character can just be made up?
