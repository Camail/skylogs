00:33:31 <Bio> they are crafty devils
01:04:56 <Camail> reddit is putting bears subreddit posts on my r/popular
01:04:59 <Camail> this is fucking terrible

01:13:15 <Crisium> even at the highest levels of play, Ana is unviable, and inferior to point and click characters
01:13:21 <Crisium> https://i.imgur.com/oXusYVi.png
01:14:57 <Crisium> i think even early fall 2016 Ana restored to her glory would be garbage
01:15:30 <Crisium> one day blizz will figure out the obvious
01:15:49 <Crisium> because reading simple stats to deduce buffs/nerf is a challenge for some

05:59:50 <Bio> I need to start making my own setting
06:00:08 <Bio> would be fun
06:00:09 <Micen|Droid> Im working on mine. 
06:00:24 <Micen|Droid> It is fun
06:03:46 <DuB`> is
06:03:47 <DuB`> it
06:03:49 <DuB`> thursday
06:03:50 <DuB`> yet

06:09:56 <DuB`> wha
06:10:41 <Micen|Droid> Overwatch and relaxing
06:11:08 <Micen|Droid> Does not make sense. Elon musk is a faulty robot from the future. That proves it
06:14:35 <DuB`> hehe
06:14:44 <DuB`> Just gotta only play arcade :P
06:15:00 <Camail> yea everyone (other than ashley because BLINDSPOT) is coming into their own
06:15:13 <Camail> i think taliesan gave up on the accent and is now just using his plain voice
06:15:23 <Camail> which honestly i prefer?
06:15:39 <Micen|Droid> The infernal voice is great. 
06:15:56 <Camail> Bo is fine, caleb is kinda too much liam at the moment
06:16:11 <Camail> nott is perfect
06:16:47 <Micen|Droid> That interaction between Nott and Fjord was amazing. 
06:24:18 <Camail> i got roped into playing csgo so i didnt end up watch the second half
06:24:35 <Camail> i usually watch the first half on thursday and the second half monday
06:24:50 <Micen> ahh, you will know the part when you see it. 
06:26:20 <Micen> the thing I like about this group is there is that there seems to be more dynamics. with VM everyone kinda paired off and there wasnt as much mixing of the pairs. but this group everyone is playing off eachother

12:11:59 <skrm> I always do
12:13:23 <Rawr|Fone> Coffee is bad dot
12:13:30 <Dot`> no it isnt rawr
12:13:44 <Dot`> newer studies show its good for your health
12:14:45 <Rawr|Fone> Coffee is the worst 
12:15:42 <skrm> Coffee is great
12:15:54 <skrm> Especially the pitch black stuff that sorta looks like tar
12:19:58 <Dot`> skrm, that hat is so shiny i dont think its ever been worn
12:20:33 <skrm> It has scratches and soot marks on it!
12:23:04 <skrm> Theres a new tom braider game in september

12:26:10 <Dot`> i tihnk i played the one before that
12:27:31 <Dot`> the ones ive played have been good fun
12:28:47 <skrm> Yeah theres 2 with the 'new' lara croft
12:28:53 <skrm> and the newest is the best by far
12:29:16 <skrm> It has a bit of the skyrim syndrome but the main storyline has all the good bits
12:30:17 <skrm> some sort of vague mysticism protected by some ancient people, a proper rival, cool ruins, something about evil soviet scientists, crazy parkour shit
12:30:23 <skrm> and superb hair physics
12:31:11 <Dot`> i enjoy all those things about tomb raider
12:34:45 <skrm> I agree with you my dude
12:34:53 <skrm> so
12:34:55 <skrm> dnd sunday

12:41:41 <Dot`> Rui is good ppl
12:42:03 <Dot`> ive known him about 9 years
12:42:17 <skrm> well compared to Ryan
