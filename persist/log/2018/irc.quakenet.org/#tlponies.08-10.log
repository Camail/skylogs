00:44:38 <Camail> skram there's a dauntless update, we should dl that
00:46:11 <skram> i thought you'd be balls deep in monster hunter
00:46:41 <Camail> it costs money
00:46:47 <Camail> and right after evo, i dont have that
00:47:00 <Camail> going to las vegas is quite the drain
00:47:01 <skram> fair enough
00:47:24 <Camail> and its easier to play free games with friends
00:47:56 <skram> thats like almost from east coast to west coast for you right
00:48:20 <Camail> it was a 4 hour flight
00:48:36 <skram> thats pretty far
00:48:38 <Camail> but also food is expensive as fuuuuuuuck
00:48:45 <skram> if i did a 4 hour flight i'd be in italy
00:49:02 <Camail> yea usa is big boy land mass
00:49:28 <Camail> 5-6 hour flight to dub, if i wanted to
00:50:06 <skram> shit i could be in friggin lisbon in 4 hours
00:50:25 <Camail> https://playdauntless.com/patch-notes/ob-0-5-0
00:50:29 <Crisium> USA is bigger than Europe if you dont count the Russians
00:50:43 <Camail> we prefer to ignore the russians as much as possible nowadays
00:51:14 <Camail> yea, when we use the word "state" to mean another section of the country and not another sovereign nation, that means its big
00:52:25 <skram> huh
00:53:47 <skram> europe is 2% of the earths surface
00:53:50 <skram> thats pretty wack
00:54:26 <Camail> europe is basically irrelevant
00:55:09 <Crisium> i mean our one state is like 1/3 of europe
00:55:10 <Crisium> https://i.imgur.com/St51LsC.png
00:55:12 <Camail> Crisium you should try dauntless, it's a great entry level for the monhun genre
00:55:27 <Camail> alaska is special
00:55:38 <Crisium> its america canada
00:55:41 <skram> cris theres like 9 people in all of alaska
00:55:46 <skram> and 8 of them are in boats
00:56:01 <Camail> the 9th is a bear
00:56:09 <Camail> but we gave her citizenship
00:56:12 <Camail> she works really hard
00:56:24 <skram> at the alaskan blockbuster
00:56:33 <skram> because apparently thats a thing that exists still
00:56:47 <Camail> SKRAM MY AXE GOT NERFED
00:56:49 <Camail> noooooo
00:56:56 <Camail> they cut the healing form 200 to 100
00:56:57 <skram> fuckin deserved aye
00:57:14 <skram> i dont know how much 100 hp is though
00:57:15 <Camail> listen bitch you didnt complain about it when we were tearing through those mean boys
00:57:17 <skram> theres no numbers
00:57:29 <skram> guess youll just have to git gud
00:57:35 <Camail> well i think you have around 1k?
00:57:35 <skram> so you can carry me with shitty weapons
00:57:37 <Crisium> ok but this state has almost 30 million
00:57:38 <Crisium> https://i.imgur.com/lQGuc6u.png
00:58:13 <skram> theres probably 30 million in the area it overlaps though

00:58:32 <Camail> but your roads suck
00:58:33 <Crisium> no theres like 100 million in that aprt of EU
00:58:33 <Camail> so ha
00:58:50 <DvB`> HALLU
00:58:53 <Crisium> hai
00:59:00 <skram> roads are fin for actual decent cars camail
00:59:07 <Crisium> and all of our people speak english and spanish
00:59:10 <skram> not those fuckin land yacht things that bounce for an hour after you park
00:59:12 <Crisium> not weird tongues such as flemish
00:59:17 <skram> flemish is fine
00:59:21 <Camail> our cars are way more sturdy than yours, thats historically proven
00:59:27 <skram> yeah
00:59:33 <Camail> you have small babies as cars
00:59:35 <skram> that means the crumple zones are your fuckin faces
00:59:42 <Camail> i dont know if i should drive it or take it for a walk
00:59:54 <skram> all american cars pre 1990 are death traps
01:00:11 <Crisium> true actually
01:00:16 <Crisium> but they are broke down now so its ok
01:00:16 <Camail> but they could drive more than 100 miles
01:00:17 <DvB`> Buy Japanese
01:00:23 <skram> fuck no
01:00:24 <Camail> NO  ONE ASKED YOU
01:00:27 <skram> they rust to death
01:00:28 <Crisium> weeb
01:00:31 <Camail> also hi dub duantless patch came out
01:00:43 <DvB`> Glorious nippon steel matsuda honda toyota
01:00:57 <Camail> nippon metals are shit
01:00:59 <DvB`> lul dauntless patch heheh
01:01:01 <Camail> they are the shittest
01:01:04 <Crisium> go back to japan dub
01:01:23 <Camail> dub stop memeing me
01:01:23 <skram> actually i dont know if road safety laws for cars are nonexistant cris or if its tv magic but theres a tv show where people buy the most sketchy fucking cars and do 80 on the highway in them
01:01:25 <DvB`> I had MOCHI today
01:01:25 <DvB`> Close enough
01:02:23 <DvB`> I can only play space games right now, so no monster hunter or dauntles
01:03:08 <skram> dub has a datsun though
01:03:11 <skram> did you bring it to la
01:03:14 <skram> no
01:03:15 <skram> sf
01:03:24 <Crisium> wow all of california is the same to skram
01:03:43 <Crisium> typical swede
01:03:44 <Crisium> no
01:03:46 <Crisium> norwege
01:03:49 <skram> thank you
01:04:17 <DvB`> No I am carless
01:04:35 <skram> you should get a buggy for your surf boards or whatever people in california do
01:04:43 <DvB`> I have a kick scooter :D
01:04:47 <DvB`> And my FEET
01:05:07 <DvB`> And the worst major city transit system in the USA!
01:05:19 <skram> whats a transit system
01:05:47 <Camail> heroic shrike and embermane got buffed
01:05:57 <Camail> stun parties are shorter
01:05:59 <DvB`> TRAINS, skram!
01:06:03 <skram> is it like that one bus that goes to sweden so old people can buy bacon?
01:06:03 <DvB`> Trains that brake and break!
01:06:13 <skram> oh right
01:06:19 <skram> is san francisco the place with the hills
01:06:36 <Camail> oh shit there's a armor rep track now
01:06:42 <Camail> more dailes/weeklies
01:06:45 <DvB`> Ya skram
01:06:56 <skram> neat
01:07:15 <skram> we have a city with a hill so we put a lift for your bike on it so you wouldnt have to get tired
01:07:27 <skram> why did they buff embermain though cam
01:07:31 <skram> worst boi ever
01:07:34 <Camail> because it was too easy
01:07:46 <Camail> its the same fight if you're bad at interrupting
01:08:08 <Camail> but +6 heavy strike chainblades still probably ruin it
01:08:20 <skram> woo
01:08:34 <Camail> which is probably what you wnat the most
01:09:06 <skram> yeah
01:09:35 <Camail> if you finished all the rep levels to get cores i'm sure you'd scrape up +3
01:11:22 <Camail> the frostback CBs have +2 weighted strike
01:12:03 <Camail> so you can get +5 from equipment if you really wanted to
01:12:21 <Camail> so you're pretty likely to find at least one WS cell if you play more
01:12:26 <skram> thats pretty good
01:12:37 <skram> wish i could just buy the ones i needed honestly
01:12:45 <Camail> Yup
01:12:52 <Camail> but its like gems in monhun
01:12:56 <Camail> just part of the genre
01:13:15 <skram> i suppose
01:13:29 <skram> this is my first monster hunter type game
01:15:29 <Camail> i agree that it's pretty dumb
01:15:42 <Camail> they should at least have the ability to get +6 in the game
01:16:07 <Camail> but luckily +5 is still tier 5 equipment so you only need a little bit of rng
01:16:13 <Camail> and honestly you just got unlucky
01:17:34 <Camail> wanna try the new monster?
01:21:51 <skram> naw not today, im heading to bed in a lil bit
01:22:16 <skram> sun rises soon and it burns us
01:23:00 <DvB`> hot sun is the bad

13:55:19 <Dot> Angel!
13:55:30 <skram> Anders.
13:59:32 <Runbunny> Bjørn, Jonas.
14:23:18 <Dot> did you get your blood runbun?
14:32:43 <Runbunny> Nah. No time really. 
14:32:56 <Runbunny> I'll probably do it after my defense.
14:33:14 <Dot> when is that ? close now?
14:40:29 <Runbunny> I have to turn in my thesis at the 4th of september.
14:40:34 <Runbunny> So somewhere after that.
14:43:12 <skram> your doctoral thesis?
14:43:45 <Dot> he is a smart lad skram, even with his anime addiction 
14:44:18 <Runbunny> No no it's just my master thesis.
14:45:00 <skram> are you doing a phd though
14:46:18 <Runbunny> If I get offered one, then yeah.
14:46:36 <skram> cool beans
14:46:49 <Runbunny> That shit costs like 3 million kroner.
14:47:09 <skram> whats the difference between a phd and like dr.scient. etc
14:47:14 <Dot> is there that much kroner in the world?
14:47:16 <skram> well ur worth it anders the boi
14:47:42 <skram> thats what a regular house where i live costs Dot
14:48:24 <Runbunny> It's like 750000 USD or something. idk
14:49:39 <Runbunny> Well Jonas, phd and dr. is like the same in the US, but here you don't get to call yourself doctor for getting a ph.d.
14:51:16 <skram> so you need to get a doctorate so i can call you Dr. Aders
14:51:20 <skram> Anders
14:51:38 <skram> what are you studying anyway
14:51:46 <skram> all i know is that you do things with blood and rats
14:51:47 <Runbunny> Kinda hard to get those in Denmark. 
14:52:05 <Runbunny> I fuck around the genome as well. in humans.
14:53:16 <skram> are you studying medicine or mad scientistism
14:53:43 <Dot> cat girls skram

19:09:36 <Cane> Runbunny, you really don't like the double tap dodge mechanic, huh?
19:09:42 <Cane> UT2K4 would have been a nightmare for you.
