02:06:01 <Crisium> o no
02:08:43 <DuB`> o ya
02:10:53 <skram> Jakob young man, have you heard any neato music lately
02:11:16 <skram> I got my vinyl collection all organized so i've only listened to familiar stuff lately but I need some new jamz
02:13:24 <skram> https://www.discogs.com/user/skrammen/collection
02:16:02 <DuB`> o man
02:17:34 <DuB`> I've only been listening to heavy-hitting stuff this month
02:17:54 <DuB`> https://soundcloud.com/dictateneuro/papam-free-dl
02:18:26 <skram> this is pretty filthy
02:19:43 <DuB`> Lotsa Alix Perez, Ivy Lab, and Eprom
02:21:35 <DuB`> My dad likes your discogs collection :P
02:22:24 <skram> Haha! Some of these belonged to my dad so that makes perfect sense :p
02:23:51 <DuB`>  Help me decide what to think about this O_o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uERIXLWeik0
02:26:18 <skram> This is some sort of odd fetish thing
02:26:23 <skram> I dont think I dig it?
02:26:55 <DuB`> But it's about PONIES! 
02:26:57 <DuB`> Hahah
02:27:17 <skram> ...Yeah this is a different sort of ponies
02:29:30 <skram> what about this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MQUleX1PeA
02:29:39 <skram> its like mindless trashy pop but ironic?
02:29:46 <DuB`> Ya
02:31:10 <DuB`> SOPHIE - "Just like we never said goodbye" is more like that
02:31:21 <DuB`> Not freaky like ponyboy and faceshopping :P
02:31:55 <DuB`> Sophie did production on the QT one
02:33:15 <skram> sophie seems linke an interesting person
02:33:25 <skram> this song is oddly stressful
02:33:44 <DuB`> Plastic pop
02:34:02 <skram> yeah
02:34:17 <DuB`> When Billboard asked Sophie what genre her music falls under, she replied "advertising."
02:34:19 <DuB`> lolol
02:34:32 <skram> theres no percussion in it and the glissando synth thing just stresses me out
02:34:59 <DuB`> She stated that she decided on the moniker Sophie because "it tastes good and it's like moisturizer"
02:35:27 <DuB`> Sophie's early visuals came from a series of colourful images she refers to as "Homemade Molecular Cooking".
02:35:30 <DuB`> ACTUALLY INSANE
02:35:44 <DuB`> Enjoy from a distance! :p
02:35:48 <skram> seems a tad contrived
02:35:57 <skram> maybe thats the point
02:36:53 <skram> whats the deal with the water slides
02:37:03 <skram> im too normie for this DuB`
02:37:03 <DuB`> Dunno mang
02:37:25 <skram> Get me outta here, fire up some dadrock with 7 minute guitar solos
02:38:24 <DuB`> Bring it down a bit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XyAFRYHjew
02:38:56 <skram> I think im getting old and boring DuB`
02:39:18 <DuB`> That's okay.
02:39:27 <DuB`> Grumpy old onkels are in style.
02:40:00 <skram> That just makes it worse!
02:40:37 <skram> I dont wanna be PART of the SYSTEM, MAAAAAAAAN
02:40:50 <DuB`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXcpXFOMT-0
02:41:02 <DuB`> Keep listening to <10k view songs on YT and escape the system with me
02:41:20 <skram> This is pretty dreamy though
02:41:47 <skram> need a rainy autumn night to enjoy this properly
02:41:50 <skram> it too dang sunny out
02:42:22 <DuB`> OOOOH that just brought the Fkj & Masego - Tadow video up in related for me
02:42:27 <DuB`> I'd forgotten that one
02:42:30 <skram> HAHA
02:42:35 <DuB`> Pretty sure I linked it to you AT LEAST twice :P
02:42:40 <skram> Yeah I was just about to link it, I keep coming back to it

23:09:56 <DuB`> I'll get comfy and start watching the new clickspring episode
23:10:03 <DuB`> Too comfy, fall asleep around 15min in
23:10:15 <DuB`> Have to rewind to watch the last 1/3rd :P
23:10:16 <Dot> where you been skram?
23:28:51 <skram> I was playing doters dot
23:28:55 <skram> we won like 5 in a row
23:29:15 <Bio> dat was a lot of doters
23:29:25 <Bio> missed me shaving 3h off my randomizer time =P
23:29:34 <skram> why are you so sleepy in the evening DuB` :p
23:29:35 <skram> nice job bio
23:29:55 <DuB`> zzz
23:30:05 <skram> there's 3 of us so we always do the offensive trilane
23:30:14 <skram> its pretty good most of the time sometimes
23:30:20 <Bio> lol
23:43:13 <Zounds> ive been tempted to doters myself recently
23:43:35 <Zounds> though im sure it will pass
23:43:39 <skram> Its more fun now imo
23:43:57 <skram> with talents and all that good stuff
23:44:22 <Zounds> Maybe DuB` and I can ruin your 3 stack sometime
23:44:23 <skram> bit more fast paced and less focus on hard carries
23:44:40 <DuB`> ye ye
23:44:57 <Zounds> aye I've followed the changes
23:45:00 <Zounds> seems decent
23:45:16 <DuB`> We need to stack ANYTHING, been bored all week :P
23:45:19 <Bio> i've played a few doters
23:45:34 <Bio> went like 3-7 lel
23:45:48 <Camail> stack pillars of eternity
23:45:49 <Bio> tho got more commends than I've ever gotten lel
23:46:10 <skram> Biggest change is how you think of roles i think
23:46:21 <Phearlock> After finishing my save a few days ago, I do agree the critical path should have been longer Camail.
23:46:29 <Phearlock> Just cause those encounters were pretty great =D
23:46:33 <Phearlock> And I'd like more of them
23:47:00 <skram> in ye olde days it was your hard carry lad and then the safe lane support/ward bitch and now its more about in terms of farm and you can be a support whatever or something
23:47:06 <skram> honestly i lost track a long time ago
23:47:32 <skram> also jungling is no longer a thing i think?
23:47:33 <skram> dunno
23:47:33 <Camail> yea, i have some criticisms of the critical path that i would get into, but spoilers
23:47:49 <Phearlock> Yeah I have some as well but ditto =D
23:48:04 <Phearlock> Overall so much fun though
23:48:26 <Bio> laning is super important as always skrm
23:48:32 <Crisium> we should quake again sometime zoonds n dab
23:48:33 <Bio> jangle has been nerfd a bunch
23:48:37 <Bio> however
23:48:47 <Zounds> yes we should cris
23:48:49 <Bio> stacking jangl packs gives gold to the person who stacked
23:48:57 <skram> yarp
23:49:02 <Zounds> oh that's kinda neat
23:49:08 <Bio> also bounty runes are super important
23:49:09 <skram> also windrunner is p good now apparently?
23:49:15 <skram> bounty runes are great
23:49:27 <Zounds> making the support less of a bitch is a good idea
23:49:29 <Bio> spawn ever 5 mins, give gold to every member of ur squad
23:49:41 <Bio> getting all 4 is like getting a tower
23:50:00 <Zounds> int heroes scale better now too right?
23:50:13 <skram> most of the more farm starved support guys get passive gpm bonuses via talents which is a godsend
23:50:14 <Bio> they changed the way stats work, yeh
23:50:28 <skram> WD get 120 gpm on like level 10 iirc
23:50:33 <Bio> +120 GPM EZ BOIS
23:51:03 <Zounds> No longer stuck with some regular boots and a stick :D
