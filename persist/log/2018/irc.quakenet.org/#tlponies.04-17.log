14:03:18 <Cane> Dot, convince me to keep playing STALKER with my current mod setup.
14:03:32 <Cane> I installed Arsenal Overhaul v3 to see if it had gotten any better, and I'm running into some problems.
14:04:37 <Dot> what problems?
14:07:06 <Cane> Well, first, some scope models are wrong, or at least bugged. I put a Warsaw Pact scope onto an MP5 (because you can do that due to rail addons), but either only the rail addon appeared or the scope (attached to the rail addon) appeared floating on top of where the rail should be.
14:07:22 <Cane> Removing the scope and putting it back on eventually fixes the problem, but it's a hair immersion breaking.
14:07:26 <Cane> Then there's the ammo problem.
14:07:38 <Cane> With that many weapons in the game, traders tend not to have the ammo you're looking for.
14:07:40 <Dot> oh dear
14:07:57 <Dot> its alike ARMA all over again!
14:08:00 <Cane> I actually haven't been able to find a shop that stocks 9mm ammo for my goddamned MP5.
14:08:19 <Dot> can you adjust ammo occurance in a config file?
14:08:26 <Dot> because like 9mm should be far more common
14:08:50 <Cane> I can, but the problem isn't that 9mm is uncommon, it's that the store has a hard limit of how much ammo to stock, so what happens is:
14:09:34 <Cane> Stocking, sure I'll have this ammo, this ammo too, yep I got this ammo, lots of this ammo, okay the dice rolled badly for this ammo so I won't have this stocked this time, oh but this ammo is common so I'll have this, BZZT, okay, I've reached my hard cap so I won't even keep going down the table looking at all the ammo below this stuff.
14:09:58 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
14:10:11 <Cane> The way traders stock stuff in STALKER is really dumb.
14:10:24 <Dot> hmm, damn
14:10:37 <Cane> I'm up in Jupiter right now, and Hawaiian has *only* new types of ammo. Doesn't even have shotgun shells.
14:11:52 <Cane> I may poke at the config to see if I can tweak the values a bit, but there's a lot of new guns and ammo types with AO.
14:12:38 <Dot> just make a bunch of ammo type unavailable in shops maybe?
14:12:43 <Dot> like the high end ammo
14:12:55 <Dot> or even better if you can adjust certain ammo to certain shops
14:13:36 <Cane> I've been considering that.
14:18:14 <Dot> then you go online and post the "Cane pack"
14:18:21 <Dot> and get all the money right?
14:50:14 <Cane> Oh yeah, modders make so much $.

18:53:27 <Bio> xD
18:53:29 <skram> Dot how long does and engineering apprenticeship last
18:53:47 <skram> also how long did you go to school
18:55:27 <DoT|Phone> 3 to 4 years
18:56:42 <DoT|Phone> and I was at school till 18 and did 4 years of engineering studies distance learning
18:59:05 <skram> so what happens when you finish your apprenticeship
18:59:09 <skram> do you get your degree
18:59:40 <DoT|Phone> it's a degree apprenticeship... so maybe?
18:59:59 <skram> the idea of an engineering apprenticeship seems odd to me Dot
19:00:05 <DoT|Phone> yes
19:00:18 <DoT|Phone> wait. didn't you do one?
19:00:33 <Bio> i've heard of internships
19:00:37 <Bio> for engineers
19:00:39 <skram> not as an engineer
19:00:44 <skram> im a trades person
19:00:46 <Bio> apprentices are usually for trades
19:00:47 <Bio> yeah
19:02:07 <skram> Im just an electrician with specialized automation training

19:02:56 <skram> unless engineers means something a bit different in england
19:03:19 <DoT|Phone> it's avery broad term
19:03:52 <skram> not in norwegian
19:06:20 <DoT|Phone> do you not have network engineers. food engineers.
19:06:35 <DoT|Phone> Everything gets engineer attached!
19:07:13 <Bio> is that why i cant get a job? engineer saturation?
19:07:14 <Bio> fak
19:07:58 <skram> Yes of course
19:08:17 <skram> but like
19:08:25 <skram> a middle management position
19:08:55 <DoT|Phone> engineer means middle management to you?
19:09:21 <skram> yes
19:09:43 <DoT|Phone> hmm. interesting
19:09:57 <skram> most foremen have engineering training
19:10:44 <skram> and usually dont do actual labour :p
19:11:19 <DoT|Phone> maintenance engineers are a thing

19:12:44 <DoT|Phone> engineer
19:13:38 <skram> Well I worked in maintenance for a few years
19:14:26 <skram> We had a foreman with engineering training and actual engineers as project people and the ones doing the work were just people with trade degrees
19:54:36 <Zounds> Technicians are usually the guys who do what the engineer tells them to
19:54:45 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
19:54:52 <Zounds> But engineer as a title is applied to tons of things here yeah
20:02:19 <skram> i need to work
20:02:19 <skram> brb
20:02:41 <Dot> gl
20:04:06 <Cane> Dot, I decided to push through. I figured out a reasonable fix for my ammo problem.
20:04:14 <Dot> oh?
20:04:17 <Dot> do tell
20:05:33 <Cane> I just doubled the amount of magazines the trader has for each ammo type. That way it doesn't matter as much if a trader doesn't have ammo type a or b, but has x and y, because you can double up on x and y. And if you're not using any weapons that need x and y, the next trader tends to have some of a and/or b, and will have enough to keep you stocked (so long as you're using common weapons anyway).

20:05:46 <Cane> More exotic weapons will still be a problem though, but that was the case in regular game too.
20:06:14 <Dot> sounds like a very brute force kind of fix
20:06:18 <Dot> but if it worls!
20:06:21 <Dot> works
20:06:30 <Dot> hey cammmmil
20:06:53 <Cane> I think the point of the system too is to force you to diversify, and probably pick up a sidearm since you'll be rolling in pistol ammo for the most part.
