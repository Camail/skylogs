00:05:30 <DuB`> Ever!
00:19:54 <Camail> that seems like a mistake
00:20:52 <Camail> i spend more time on my beard than every other part of my body combined
00:21:22 <Camail> i think internet culture has made me really careful and aggressively preventing a neckbeard
00:21:28 <DuB`> :P
00:22:12 <Camail> its so hard to balance between a neckbeard and a chinstrap
00:22:24 <Camail> there is a vague area in there where a full beard lies
00:23:30 <DuB`> I'm glad you've made the effort
00:24:48 <Camail> dub are you allowed to have facial hair
00:24:50 <Camail> not as a mormon thing
00:25:02 <Camail> but as like, a local culture thing
00:25:11 <DuB`> University doesn't like it :P
00:25:18 <DuB`> Not that I could do much anyway...
00:25:28 <Camail> wait your university frowns on facial hair
00:25:33 <Camail> thats impressive
00:25:36 <DuB`> Ye
00:26:17 <Camail> do they dislike long hair on guys too
00:26:30 <DuB`> Think so
00:26:33 <Camail> woof
00:27:42 <Camail> that does not help change my assumption about utah
00:28:16 <Camail> OH SHIT
00:28:20 <Camail> VP IS DONE
00:28:25 <DuB`> Church-owned uni does what it want
00:28:36 <DuB`> Ya noplow
00:28:37 <Camail> virtus pro CS team is dissolving
00:28:50 <Camail> fuckin rip
00:28:52 <Camail> thats so sad
00:28:58 <DuB`> I'd assumed you knew, I saw first thing this morning :T
00:29:59 <Camail> i havent gone on the subreddit today
00:30:14 <DuB`> Oh yeah you don't really twotter
00:31:04 <Camail> i do not even have one
00:31:07 <Camail> tho i will have to
00:31:11 <Camail> on dec 17th
00:35:52 <Crisium> twotter
00:37:54 <Crisium> https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1073369823730647040
00:39:21 <Camail> blizzard has been told to cut costs? i seriously doubt they are in financial trouble
00:39:49 <Camail> and all the money they sank into OW dev for all those years was clearly made back
00:40:08 <DuB`> Don't have to be in financial trouble to be told to improve bottom line
00:40:08 <Camail> and jesus...they have had CITIES give them insane amounts of money for OWL, right?
00:40:54 <Camail> hots should die because no one plays it, not because of a stockholder mandate =/
00:41:12 <DuB`> Ya
00:41:19 <Crisium> 3rd most popular moba isnt bad, but yeah its small
00:41:25 <Camail> there are only 3 mobas
00:41:35 <Crisium> smite is a moba right
00:41:58 <Camail> the gulf in playerbase between 1-2,3, and the rest, is gigantic
00:42:10 <Crisium> oh yeah its a distant third for sure
00:42:24 <Crisium> i guess it's F2P model doesnt have enough wales to make it worth it
00:43:04 <Camail> this kind of rich-get-richer mentality is disheartening  for future decisions on their publishing
00:43:11 <Runbunny> The new character they unveiled for hots at blizzcon looks pretty cool though.
00:43:23 <Runbunny> Still isn't enough to get me to play the game.
00:43:59 <Camail> competitive games require too much effort to ever really share player bases
00:44:01 <Crisium> i dont really like mobas that much anyway.  i prefer overwatch and paladins hero shooter lite-moba style
00:44:15 <Crisium> let me click heads
00:45:37 <Runbunny> Luckily there is fan art I can look at. I think.
00:45:49 <Runbunny> So I am covered. Thanks again artists.
00:47:02 <Camail> i just want diablo 4
00:47:19 <Camail> and i want angel tyrael
00:47:36 <Camail> give me my cool angel dude back you fucks
00:52:36 <Crisium> just give me a starcraft 3 that plays more like broodwar
00:53:08 <Crisium> not in terms of limitations like 12 units and no MBS, i mean the other things
00:53:45 <DuB`> RTS are rip
00:54:26 <Crisium> yeah its crazy how RTS died as a genre as soon as mobas existed
00:54:45 <Crisium> ppl just prefer microing 1 guy to whole armiers
00:55:05 <Crisium> and/or dont like RTS 1v1s
00:55:21 <Runbunny> 1v1's are too stressfull
00:55:29 <Runbunny> and you can't blame anyone but yourself.
00:55:39 <Crisium> oh no, you can blame balance
00:55:40 <Runbunny> Just like fighting games.
00:55:49 <Crisium> "you played OP race"
00:55:58 <Crisium> its a mirror match: "you played OP strat"
00:55:59 <Crisium> :P

07:11:55 <DoT|Phone> Morning
07:13:06 <DuB`> Dot!
07:13:28 <DoT|Phone> dub!
07:15:13 <Camail> dot are you caught up with CR?
07:16:03 <DoT|Phone> nope.
07:16:43 <DuB`> HAH
07:17:11 <DuB`> After two years of occaisional nudging, my IRL friends have finally decided they want to try OW
07:18:08 <Camail> lul
07:18:12 <Camail> will you even have fun?
07:18:46 <DuB`> Why not!
07:19:18 <Camail> the opponents will be bumbling idiots
07:19:30 <DuB`> Perfect
07:19:43 <DuB`> It'll feel like release week in 2016 all over again
07:20:11 <Camail> but you know what you're doing now
07:20:56 <DuB`> 1/12 people knowing doesn't change a game much :P
07:21:02 <DuB`> And I can just focus on babysitting
07:21:43 <Camail> but when you genji and get a 6k
07:22:06 <Camail> i guess its fun in a deathmatch kinda way
07:22:20 <Camail> like when i play silvers, its mostly just fun to shoot ppl
07:22:42 <DuB`> ye, also now that there are lotsa custom game options I suspect a lot of our first hours will just be in that messing around and showing the characters
07:23:01 <Camail> and now you get to learn about your friends fetishes
07:23:07 <DuB`> lul
07:23:08 <Camail> watch out for the ones who main hamster boy
07:24:16 <Camail> also are you trying to convert all your friends into Gamerz like you
07:24:30 <Camail> i swear if, in two month, i join and they're all in irc
07:24:33 <DuB`> That has already been accomplished.
07:24:37 <Camail> i will know who to suspect
07:24:40 <DuB`> Hahaha
07:24:52 <DuB`> Only one of them ever watched mlp, I think...
07:25:03 <Camail> good, thats basically us anyway
07:25:17 <DuB`> Anyway, we spent like 6 hours in quake, csgo, and dota today
07:25:25 <DoT|Phone> he won't need us anymore
07:25:29 <DuB`> All 3 of them got their own nice PCs this year, one just last month
07:25:32 <DuB`> Conversion is complete
07:25:34 <Camail> nice
07:26:44 <Camail> dot he already doesnt need us
07:26:52 <Camail> we're vestigial 
07:26:55 <Camail> well, i'm not
07:26:59 <Camail> i am an emotional anchor
07:27:13 <Camail> keeping everyone levelheaded
07:27:19 <DuB`> ... of course.
07:27:27 <DuB`> Also there are more of you than them, you can take 'em.
07:27:38 <Camail> half of us are afk
07:27:46 <DuB`> Ooh, I know
07:27:49 <DuB`> We'll have a Quake TDM to determine who my real friends are!
07:27:51 <DuB`> ;D
07:28:21 <Camail> well they are all terrible still so thats not fair
07:28:49 <DuB`> One has already played more than I have in total, haha
07:28:56 <DuB`> ... but overall, yes you are right.
07:29:31 <Camail> unless he's watching rapha, i doubt he's getting quality practice
07:29:37 <Camail> and aim takes a loooong time to refine
07:29:49 <DuB`> He did tune into the tourney a couple weeks ago all on his very own
07:29:52 <DuB`> I was so proud.
07:29:56 <Camail> dang, good on him
07:30:03 <Camail> give him a cookie, from me
07:30:05 <Camail> you buy it tho
07:30:08 <DuB`> haha
07:31:10 <Camail> ok dub this peisode
07:31:14 <Camail> imagine a big banana peel
07:31:25 <Camail> and everyone is pissing their pants at how big and scary this banana peel is
07:31:26 <DuB`> Uh huh
07:31:35 <Camail> and they all run around, slipping on parts of the one giant peel
07:32:05 <DuB`> Sounds sticky.
07:32:21 <DoT|Phone> this is sounding like every plan in dnd being executed
07:32:37 <DuB`> Quite :P

19:53:20 <Runbunny> I didn't think they could top the toothbrush scene and let alone the shower scene. But low and behold. 
20:05:25 <DuB`> O dear

20:07:30 <Zounds> I ran into a cat girl player in FFXIV who would say everynyan instead of everyone and stuff like that
20:07:42 <Zounds> I didn't know how to react tbh
20:09:59 <Runbunny> head pats.
20:12:04 <Zounds> fuck that
20:14:13 <Dot> haha dub

20:18:45 <Runbunny> Hai Phearlock.
20:19:22 <Phearlock> Runbunny! Hi
20:19:26 <Phearlock> How is denmark?
20:19:34 <Phearlock> Coldest day of the year so far here
20:19:40 <Phearlock> with like -7 and wind
20:19:49 <Phearlock> oof that wind
20:20:22 <DuB`> I would LIKE to get subnautica for free, but Epic account system can't figure out who I am even after resetting password 4 times
20:20:29 <DuB`> And now it won't let me reset anymore
20:20:57 <Phearlock> Lol early access store
20:21:11 <Zounds> I bought that game years ago pretty much to support the dev cuz NS2
20:21:15 <Runbunny> It's like 1 C here.
20:21:20 <Runbunny> So it's not too bad.
20:21:59 <Phearlock> I got it last year when it did it's like "we're out of early access" release
20:22:19 <Phearlock> Was a good time
20:23:56 <Phearlock> (in that regard I am sad dub is not getting it to work, cause it is a great game)
20:24:20 <DuB`> Epic, your Everything is bad.
20:24:31 <Rawr|Phone> Did you not get any of the snow runbun
20:24:47 <Runbunny> no snow :/
20:24:49 <Phearlock> Everything except their income from fortnite microtransactions.
20:31:35 <Camail> dub subnautica is so good
20:31:39 <Camail> its sooooo goooooood
20:31:50 <Phearlock> Yes
20:32:02 <DuB`> Epic says no
20:32:06 <DuB`> I'll just make a new account..
20:32:18 <Camail> its the only open world game that has truly tapped into the wonder of exploration for me
20:32:24 <Runbunny> Already getting screwed by Epic.
20:32:36 <Camail> epic is good at two things
20:32:42 <Camail> making fortnite, and making game engines
20:33:19 <Camail> i hope they get their storefront to work, because i think steam needs a legitimate competitor, not just companies making stores for their own games
20:33:35 <Camail> god knows they have the investment capital
20:33:41 <Camail> they have too much money
20:34:13 <Runbunny> But Camail what about the discord store?
20:34:25 <Camail> i didnt even know it existed
20:34:28 <Camail> if that's any indication
20:34:36 <Camail> how does discord even make money to begin with
20:34:46 <Camail> the whole app just screams bullshit, but its useful so i use it
20:35:10 <Phearlock> I keep expecting to have to pay for it at some point yes
20:35:14 <Phearlock> like a shareware time limit
20:35:15 <Runbunny> It probably sells data.
20:35:30 <Runbunny> Tons of money was invested into it early on.
20:35:44 <carcinization> there is discord nitro
20:35:55 <DuB`> They do have Discord Plus or whatever it's called
20:35:57 <DuB`> Nitro?
20:36:24 <Phearlock> Discord animated avatars version
20:43:04 <Phearlock> Seriously though dub subnautica is the best exploration game
20:43:09 <Phearlock> Also yay fish
20:43:15 <Phearlock> pretty fish
20:43:17 <Phearlock> spooky fish
20:44:02 <DuB`> ooooocean
20:44:09 <DuB`> Oshen is almost as good as spess
20:46:41 <DuB`> I do like the Discord quick launcher, actually.
20:46:57 <DuB`> One-click open games regardless of which launcher/platform.
20:47:45 <Phearlock> Ye, if epic does manage to make itself a legitimate competitor to steam it might be really good or really bad for discord
20:48:03 <Phearlock> It could take over as a unified launcher for the multiple clients
20:48:18 <Phearlock> But its store could also be run over before it gets started
20:48:28 <Phearlock> Will be interesting to see
21:12:13 <DuB`> Hangzhou team skins are on PTR now: https://i.imgur.com/HSNPRTO.png
21:12:14 <DuB`> I love
21:20:14 <Zounds> hm
21:33:50 <DuB`> Time to OCEAN
21:34:35 <Phearlock> Have fun! I'd talk about it more but no spoils
21:34:36 <Runbunny> Go swim.
21:34:45 <Runbunny> There's water.
21:34:50 <Runbunny> Spoiler time over.
21:35:11 <Golly> Dub; if you roll on a riven, and then sell it, does the new owner start fresh on kuva cost, or where previous owner ended off
21:35:16 <DuB`> Survival or Freedom...
21:35:26 <DuB`> No, it keeps roll count Golly
21:35:44 <DuB`> I think you can see that number on the bottom? Can't remember
21:36:38 <DuB`> Yeah bottom right.
21:36:40 <Golly> ah yes, ive rolled 6 times on this lenz riven. not much luck so far
21:37:28 <DuB`> Lenz ones can be fun -- I got something like 60% fire rate and 110% critchance after 10 or so rolls
21:38:17 <Phearlock> There is a story, so the regular survival is recommended
21:38:29 <Phearlock> Best pacing
21:44:41 <Phearlock> Also today at the store I had a customer ask me in slightly broken norwegian if I had "Heard of a fish called whale" and if we had it in stock.
21:45:00 <Phearlock> I almost laughed, it was hard.
21:46:53 <Runbunny> You didn't get into elaborate details about how whales aren't fish?
21:47:42 <Phearlock> I showed them where the whale was and made an offhand comment that they're not actually fish but I don't think they understood
22:00:06 <Camail> i just want dub to have completed subnautica already
22:00:19 <Camail> its never a bad time to yell about how amazing that game is
