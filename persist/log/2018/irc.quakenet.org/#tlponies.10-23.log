17:33:16 <DuB`> I ordered a book on amazon to have during all my travels this week and they say it arrived yesterday and I can't find it ANYWHERE! D:
17:38:14 <Dot> what book
17:51:20 <reification> clearly too bad to tell us :O
17:52:37 <DuB`> Sorry, had to go grab some stuff
17:52:44 <DuB`> Book 4 of the the Expanse series!
18:03:21 <reification> must be very expansive by then

18:40:39 <skram> i looked at the royal mails list of prohibited and restricted items and i couldnt find any remarks
18:40:49 <skram> post office said no?
18:40:59 <Dot> everyone said no apparently
18:41:05 <Dot> tried multiple couriers too
18:41:09 <skram> damn
18:41:10 <Dot> going to try more tomorw
18:41:22 <skram> though i did my homework on that
18:41:39 <Dot> its apparently like Aus and honey
18:41:42 <skram> well if you cant ship it you should probably just eat it :P
18:42:12 <Dot> or become a smuggler
18:42:40 <skram> dont go to jail
18:43:25 <Dot> norwegion jails look great though
18:44:04 <skram> you'd have to eat rotten fish
18:44:21 <Dot> not if i smuggle the choclate in there too!
18:44:36 <skram> if you dont you go to super-jail
18:49:37 <reification> https://i.redd.it/vuici0hc1zt11.jpg
18:52:04 <reification> i don't see chocolate on the prohibited items list dot https://www.royalmail.com/norway
18:52:30 <reification> oh skram already said that >.>
18:52:54 <Zounds> "chocolate"
18:52:54 <reification> is it milk chocolate?
18:52:58 <Zounds> what are you really sending dot
18:53:07 <Dot> squirrals
18:53:25 <reification> because milk is "Products of animal origin, not elsewhere specified or included"
18:55:07 <skram> its specifically not milk chocolate
18:57:36 <Dot> i passed this on skram
18:58:27 <skram> i mean they probably know more about this than I do but I did look through the documents on their website and couldnt find anything :(
19:03:40 <DuB`> Choco smuggling???
19:03:43 <DuB`> Sounds fun.
