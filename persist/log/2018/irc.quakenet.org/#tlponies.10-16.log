01:11:26 <Camail> ded
01:12:47 <skram> ITS V LATE CAM
01:12:57 <Camail> THEN GO TO BED
01:13:14 <skram> BUT THERES COOL STUFF ON THE INTERNET, DAD
01:13:49 <Camail> THATS NOT EVEN TRUE THE INTERNET SUCKS
01:14:33 <Camail> i've built 4 different sets yesterday and today...they all are sooo much worse than akhan condemn builds
01:14:56 <skram> is thorns build a thing you can do still
01:14:59 <Camail> roland sweep builds work and can do t13 but i seriously doubt they can do anything above GR 60 
01:15:02 <skram> it was my favorite thing so far
01:15:09 <Camail> thorns is....not really a build?
01:15:18 <Camail> but it is a build i made for the achievement
01:15:34 <Camail> there's a setless build thats fascinating to play, and it can do GR 45
01:16:04 <Camail> there are a select few pieces that synergize, then you use convention of elements and run away until it wheels to physical dmg
01:16:16 <Camail> but there's no viable build for standing there and getting hit a bunch
01:16:36 <Camail> you use thorns to buff bombardment, not to actually act as reflective armor
01:17:42 <skram> well you reroll all your things to thorns and you do punishes
01:17:48 <skram> theres a set that synergizes
01:18:05 <skram> invoker
01:18:46 <skram> granted it isnt standing still and doing all the things but it builds on your thorns damage
01:18:49 <skram> so sort of
01:18:50 <skram> maybe
01:22:12 <Camail> like, yea invoker is a set but its all pretty terrible if you cant get 100% akarats uptime
01:22:45 <skram> ya akarat build has been the shit since forever
01:22:52 <skram> but the invoker thing was fairly decent at some point
01:23:44 <Camail> it's a good build if you manage to get all of your gear to have no critical% of any kind
01:24:24 <Camail> blocking in this game is very fake so its always tough to make a truly tanky build that scales
01:25:19 <Camail> at lvl 70 you're getting 30k dmg protection from a block, so a lot of your non-set slots are dedicated to making block not suck

01:47:21 <Camail> ok so, if i ever got a primal ancient weapon i could probably do gr 100
01:47:49 <Camail> but 92 took 10 minutes so at this point i just need to play better
01:53:29 <skram> 92 is pretty good
01:53:34 <skram> best WD is 105 iirc
02:06:18 <Camail> the most obvious thing is to grind for gem levels, for fusing into armor and upgrading my main gems
02:20:46 <Camail> the strategy seems to be to survive the mobs and run to find elites, normal enemies have too much health to be rewarded efficiently
02:28:01 <DuB`> The word "negotiations" is the worst
