20:29:03 <skram> its called the nap
20:29:17 <Dot> im really bad at naps
20:29:24 <skram> what yoku do is pretend to be dead for an hour or two and you dont die or anything
20:30:01 <Rawr|Fone> Or maybe 12 hours
20:30:04 <Rawr|Fone> Who knows
20:30:58 <Zounds> Yeh that's a risk with naps
20:31:54 <skram> thats why you dont nap in a bed
