20:17:34 <Camail> i'm trying a lotr mod for rimworld and its everything i wanted because it removes all the guns
20:17:43 <Camail> doesn't play well with other low tech mods tho
20:18:13 <Camail> and this colony literally cannot leave, so it goes till it dies
20:18:49 <Runbunny> Hai Dub
20:19:45 <Dot> cam, if you get tired of having a UI you can always play dorf fort
20:19:57 <Camail> i like graphics
20:20:04 <Camail> so thats probably never gonna happen
20:20:25 <Dot> only purists play with ascii
20:20:43 <Dot> i have always used tilesets
20:21:32 <Camail> the isometric view looks fun

20:48:04 <Camail> 4403 petabytes of porn went through the intertubes this year
20:48:07 <Camail> thats...damn
20:48:26 <carcinization> what's that as a % of overall traffic?

20:52:46 <Zounds> heh that's pretty funny
20:53:06 <Zounds> but I mean of course they do
20:54:36 <Camail> yea but it's novel in the sense that we've never had such an impossible to ignore data point
20:54:49 <Camail> but simultaneously, these big data analyzers completely gloss over it
20:55:06 <Camail> cuz a huge chunk of their profits come from illegal porn views
20:55:17 <Camail> so they go "hey look at this neat thing!...anywaaaaay"
20:55:32 <Zounds> Who the heck just searches hentai on pornhub
20:55:53 <Camail> i dont think its exactly that
20:56:04 <Camail> any searches where the videos being returned are categorized as hentai
20:56:35 <Camail> so hentai is probably in the search bar, but with more specifics as well? or a show title , or "anime"
20:57:00 <Camail> but also yea its a terrible place to search for it
20:57:20 <Camail> but people are lazy
20:58:16 <Dot> thats a lot of data
20:58:44 <Camail> and of course stormy daniels had her career boosted to the moon after the president cheated on his wife with her
20:59:02 <Camail> bowsette was #9
20:59:23 <Camail> fuck yea bowsette, what a fantastic character
20:59:38 <Camail> i'm sad fanart died down
20:59:40 <Zounds> Korean getting a big boost
20:59:49 <Zounds> Kpop really becoming mainstream in the west
20:59:57 <Camail> lmao 4k was #3
21:00:03 <Camail> like these idiots have 4k displays
21:00:20 <Camail> at best, its better to downscale the resolution
21:00:27 <Camail> but still, what a waste
21:00:28 <Zounds> I managed to get entirely sick of the sight of kpop years and years ago through starcraft
21:00:41 <Zounds> Thought it was mostly shit then and still shit now
21:00:59 <Camail> i think the asian music industry is scary and dangerous
21:01:06 <Camail> regardless of the music quality it is horrifying
21:03:41 <Zounds> I wonder if the western one is really much better
21:03:51 <Zounds> with the amount of deranged lunatics it spawns after they get spat out
21:05:09 <Camail> there is still a predatory problem with the labels and the media, but its just...its not as devilish 
21:05:33 <Camail> like, the stories you hear about how female kpop stars having to hide their romantic relationships
21:05:56 <Camail> if they are anything but pure virgins they are ridiculed and harassed, violently sometimes
21:06:14 <Camail> not to mention all of the alleged sexual abuse in the idol scene
