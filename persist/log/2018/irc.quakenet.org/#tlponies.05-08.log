05:53:35 <DuB`> I did some
05:53:40 <DuB`> Been a while though.
05:55:44 <DuB`> .tell skram My guilty pleasure is songs that are more "sound design" than "music" >:P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtEuwWisFcI

06:26:11 <Rawr|Fone> Dot
06:26:27 <Dot> couldnt sleep rawr
06:26:34 <Rawr|Fone> :/
06:27:37 <Rawr|Fone> Do you have work today?
06:28:58 <Dot> nope
06:29:08 <Dot> and you rawr? what you up to
06:30:00 <Rawr|Fone> That's good
06:30:08 <Rawr|Fone> I'm at the gym before work
06:30:15 <Dot> fit horse
06:30:22 <Dot> .tell Bio` https://rodrigues404.deviantart.com/art/Mah-Book-743938904
06:30:32 <Dot> i dont tihnk ive ever been to a gym rawr
06:30:37 <Dot> too many ppl for me
06:32:11 <Rawr|Fone> Well if I go in the morning before work, it's pretty empty
06:38:42 <Dot> cane, you see mephs new tileset
06:40:21 <Cane> Oh, no, is it good?
06:41:02 <Dot> requires 4k screen
06:41:11 <Dot> http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=161047
06:41:50 <Dot> latest update https://imgur.com/a/XIaYOi4
06:47:04 <Cane> Okay wow.
06:47:23 <Cane> But why does it require a 4k screen? Won't the game just be zoomed in, NetHack style?
06:47:42 <Dot> it can run on smaller but it simplifies the sprites apparently
06:48:10 <Cane> Hmm.
06:49:02 <Dot> "why you buying a 4k screen?"  "For dorf fort, that ascii game"
06:50:57 <Cane> lol it's definitely tempting.
06:51:03 <Cane> I do like my dorfs.
06:51:46 <Dot> im so glad tantrum spirals are back
06:52:18 <Dot> and also in the latest patch when "dorf cant reach item" it shows you THE ITEM
06:52:20 <Dot> and not the dorf
07:03:53 <Dot> is there more cane stream today?
07:04:37 <Cane> Maybe some Keen. I'm STALKER'd out for now.
07:06:07 <Dot> did the last run die?
07:06:23 <Dot> i was awake hourly so was keeping a check on how it was going
07:07:57 <Dot> some of the new artifacts seem stupid strong
07:25:34 <Cane> Yeah, Zaton bug again. =(
07:25:38 <Cane> I've lost like three characters up there now.
07:25:49 <Dot> dam :/ 
07:25:50 <Cane> It was a good run though, 2 days and another hour of play before it died.

07:26:04 <Cane> Couple of close calls but it was good.
07:26:09 <Cane> New run is shaping up to be solid though.
07:26:25 <Cane> And yeah, a few of the new artifacts are super good, but at the same time I don't really mind the new influx of *stuff* to do.
07:26:33 <Cane> They're part of Lost to the Zone, so take it or leave it basically.
07:26:56 <Cane> And I kind of realized that I didn't use the old artifacts that much.
07:27:22 <Cane> I mostly used things like Goldfish to increase my carry capacity, and otherwise swapped out for resistance ones when I needed to go into an anomaly field.
07:27:43 <Cane> The new ones are giving me a lot more options, but I do think some of them are probably brokenly good.
07:27:48 <Cane> Heart of the Oasis now is stupid.
07:28:14 <Cane> But for Iron Man runs it doesn't matter too much 'cause you rarely have enough slots to use them, and honestly, anything to avoid being instagibbed by enemies spawning in behind me.
07:28:37 <Dot> yea,, makes sense

23:26:01 <DuB`> Ssshhh
23:26:08 <Camail> 99% of tomatoes are gross
23:28:26 <Phearlock> gossly tasty
23:28:41 <Zounds> English mustard is one of the most delicious things
23:28:47 <Zounds> Or Colemans if we're naming brands
23:29:34 <skram> what makes the 1% not gross cam
23:30:06 <Camail> i had a tomato in italy once and it was godlike
23:30:16 <Camail> so some are really good
23:30:27 <Camail> but american tomatoes are kinda ass
23:31:18 <Camail> raw tomatoes are universally immoral tho
23:32:50 <skram> homegrown tomatoes are pretty great though
