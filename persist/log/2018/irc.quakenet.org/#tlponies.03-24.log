02:37:07 <Camail> slowly bust surely i am becoming less toxic in games, it takes awhile
02:37:44 <DuB`> Been really fun stacking
02:38:03 <skram> ya
02:38:05 <DuB`> It has been*, I dunno why I'm in the habit of leaving the first part of sentences off >_>
02:38:17 <skram> except that last one
02:38:37 <skram> or second to last
02:41:55 <Camail> the last loss was rough
02:42:05 <Camail> but mostly because my hand was hurting and it was really hard to play dps
02:42:10 <Camail> shoulda stuck to lucio
02:42:27 <DuB`> That's rough :T
02:44:27 <Camail> was really fun tho, lucio is really fun to play
02:45:01 <Camail> we need to solidify tlp meta
02:45:08 <Camail> the 3 support is strong
02:45:25 <skram> im a brig main now
02:45:28 <skram> forever and ever
02:45:55 <Camail> brig/lucio/zen
02:45:58 <Camail> then 3 other ppl
02:46:21 <Camail> people who can abuse the fact that they get healed
02:46:24 <Camail> probably reaper
02:46:24 <skram> yep
02:46:29 <Camail> dive, lose 90% run back
02:47:08 <Camail> reaper, winston, d.va?
02:47:25 <skram> yeah
02:47:34 <skram> genji maybe
02:47:50 <Camail> yea depending on the game the dps has some wiggle room
02:47:55 <DuB`> Reaper/tracer if no verticality
02:48:11 <DuB`> Genji if dva/winston are going to be going up and down from high grounds
02:48:29 <Camail> the meta intensifies
02:48:37 <DuB`> Hehe
02:49:13 <Camail> d.va seems nutso because zen + all that armor healing
02:49:45 <Camail> winston and genji arew the ones that seem the most interchangeable
02:50:40 <Camail> having rein, assuming he doesnt get hard countered, is nice because this comp benefits from long fights
02:50:47 <DuB`> Ye
02:50:48 <Camail> the biggest problem would be burst damage
02:50:53 <Camail> theres like none
02:51:08 <DuB`> Getting to stand next to brig+lucio and just SWIIING as rein is so fun
02:51:18 <Camail> yea he is beastly
02:51:46 <DuB`> I've had four or five gold damage rein games in the last two days
02:57:53 <DuB`> Oh thank goodness
02:58:48 <DuB`> Valiant not getting either 3-1 or 4-0ed in this game against Fusion was kinda a requirement for Gladiators to have playoff spot shot
03:00:06 <DuB`> Where is Cris, he's the only other one that cares about all this :P

21:09:55 <Bio> to slay the dragon
21:10:05 <skram> Either fighter or a ranger like rui
21:10:13 <Bio> neato
21:10:24 <Bio> dot wants to be a halfling pally
21:10:34 <skram> dot is a weird lad
21:10:35 <Bio> and tj has expressed interest in being a gun-boi
21:10:44 <skram> gun boi?
21:10:46 <skram> is that a thing
21:10:56 <Bio> its from Critrole
21:10:58 <Bio> https://img.fireden.net/tg/image/1452/63/1452630054565.pdf
21:11:04 <skram> right right
21:11:37 <DuB`> Hehe
21:12:15 <DuB`> In my solo game we broke their spirit enough on attack that when it came time for their offense they just threw with a mei doom cree widow tracer zen team
21:12:22 <Bio> I wanna do factorio
21:12:34 <skram> god job dub
21:12:37 <skram> break their backs
21:12:39 <Bio> someone come build plates with me
21:12:42 <skram> then burn their house down
21:21:29 <DuB`> Gladiators have to 4-0 or 3-0 Uprising today to make stage playoffs. D:
21:22:48 <skram> right
21:22:50 <skram> the owl is on
21:23:21 <skram> dhy dont we like boston again
21:23:27 <skram> why
21:23:37 <skram> its team huk
21:23:46 <DuB`> I like boston
21:24:01 <DuB`> Huk team, and striker+dreamkazper are flashy support duo
21:24:04 <DuB`> But I like Glads more!
21:24:10 <skram> w h yyy
21:24:15 <DuB`> SUREFOUR
21:24:25 <DuB`> Also Fissure is the best tank evr.
21:24:31 <skram> surefour is a washed out has been
21:24:37 <DuB`> Nuh uh
21:24:58 <skram> jo
21:25:02 <DuB`> You're thinking of Former Envyus
21:25:12 <Crisium> that glorious c9
21:25:51 <DuB`> Does OW ranked not take ANY performance into account anymore?
21:25:58 <DuB`> Medals/damage/blocked etc?
21:26:07 <DuB`> Is it just W/L
21:27:56 <Zounds> Yeh
21:28:08 <Zounds> Diamond + has no performance SR
21:28:17 <DuB`> I see I see
21:28:28 <DuB`> Yeah read that just now, performance is minor SR factor below diamond
21:29:28 <Zounds> Performance SR would be great if they could quantify good play properly
21:29:42 <Zounds> But since the can't i suppose W/L is the best they can get
21:34:01 <skram> seagull is a tank main now?
21:34:51 <DuB`> Yes, because Dallas has no tank players for now. :P
21:35:35 <skram> well thers cocco
21:35:37 <Crisium> just w/l, based on SR of the teams
21:35:55 <DuB`> Cocco is RIP
21:35:57 <DuB`> Or something
21:36:19 <Crisium> if OW thinks your team should win and you lose, you will still lose points than you get when winning
21:36:42 <skram> what
21:37:36 <Crisium> if your team is SR 3000 and you are SR 3100.  and the enemy team is SR 2950.  if you lose you will be like -26 or something.  if you win you will get +22 or something
21:37:57 <Crisium> they still expect you to carry if you are better
21:38:09 <skram> right
21:49:42 <DoT|Phone> Skram please
21:55:21 <Zounds> I suppose it makes sense
21:55:35 <Zounds> otherwise everyone with a 51% winrate would end up 5000 rated eventually
22:05:49 <Crisium> yeah
22:06:01 <Crisium> thats one only like 1 person made 5000 ever
22:06:27 <Crisium> once you get above 4500 you need to an insane winrate to keep climbing
