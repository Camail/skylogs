13:37:27 <Bio> much like the life during school, but less coursework
13:37:36 <Bio> also no job

13:53:46 <ZK-phone> Ohhh, yea, those are harder to get by :/
13:54:16 <ZK-phone> Most computer engineers or even electrical engineers ended up going into programming for their first job

22:14:51 <DuB`> Dot why are oxygenfolk NEVER HAPPY
22:15:06 <Dot> why you making them unhappy?
22:15:26 <DuB`> I just wanna do science but they're all, "I need to go to the bathroom" and "I'm starving to death" and "waaah waaah".
22:16:03 <Dot> let them die, bring in new duplicants
22:16:04 <Dot> easy
22:17:22 <Dot> food is easy though, start with 1 guy who can cook
22:17:36 <Dot> at the start you can survive off just mining those cracked blocks
22:17:43 <Dot> they are often food
22:17:57 <Dot> and put auto harvest on the natural plants
22:18:50 <Dot> then once you have coal you can just set the cook to make the green dodgy food continuos
22:26:50 <Micen|Droid__>  It's too hot outside
22:27:41 <Micen|Droid__> About 93f/34c out 
22:27:53 <Micen|Droid__> And I'm having to grill. 
22:28:49 <DuB`> Yikes
22:34:08 <Phearlock> Wet towel over your head helps
22:34:16 <Phearlock> And stay hydrated =D
22:41:55 <Micen|Droid__> Yep. Have a wet washcloth on my neck and am drinking two bottles of water a time. 
22:42:24 <Dot> Runbunny, hibs pretty far in this run
22:42:47 <Dot> these angel things are scary
22:43:26 <Dot> demons even more so
22:43:40 <Runbunny> I will check!
22:44:20 <Runbunny> !!!
22:46:11 <Dot> dual boss fights suck
22:48:56 <Dot> rip
22:56:05 <reification> night all
23:36:04 <Micen|Droid__> I'm done. 
23:36:33 <Micen|Droid__> 5 hours of grilling in crazy heat
23:37:40 <Phearlock> oof
