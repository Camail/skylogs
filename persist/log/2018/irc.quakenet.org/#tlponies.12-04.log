19:16:54 <Zounds> wonder why so much of their stuff got flagged on tumblr
19:17:04 <Zounds> sharing a tag with nsfw stuff maybe?
19:23:00 <DuB`> So col
19:23:06 <DuB`> There is sno!
19:24:40 <Camail> Zounds  i would guess its because nsfw accounts were liking/reblogging them
19:25:19 <Camail> i doubt their fire and brimstone solution has image recognition, so its probably weighing the nsfw-ness of images by account relationships and tags
19:25:37 <Camail> and a lot of people who like nsfw pony stuff also like sfw pony stuff so yea
19:25:58 <Zounds> Yeah :/ sad situation

21:44:51 <Camail> should've sacrificed optimal play on normal enemies, but w/e
21:46:55 <Camail> this one is a draft and not sealed, so i was actually really happy with my first 15
21:53:28 <skram> what you up to Dot`
21:55:55 <Dot`> playing Battle Brothers skram, is fun game, i am a bit hungry though
21:59:38 <Crisium> dont eat the game dot
21:59:51 <Camail> well, maybe eat the game
22:00:28 <Camail> if you could use data as sustenance then you'd be cruising on easy street
22:00:52 <reification> game is tasty, especially venison
22:08:40 <DuB`> My friend went hunting and now there are like 50 pounds of deer jerky in our apartment >_>
22:08:44 <DuB`> It's meh
22:08:53 <Camail> yea basic jerky is meh
22:09:15 <Camail> put some spice on it or sumthin
22:09:31 <Camail> dub you should dip it in ketchup, see how that tastes
22:09:39 <skram> jerky is meh
22:09:44 <Crisium> jerky haters
22:09:47 <Crisium> jerks
22:10:00 <skram> just cook it with the potato and it it with jam ??
22:10:02 <Camail> jerky is like, the second most important food in history
22:10:10 <Camail> only behind rice
22:10:16 <Camail> respect your ancestors skram
22:10:32 <skram> that doesnt determine tastiness
22:10:45 <Camail> well rice is delicious, and jerky is great
22:10:49 <Camail> so ur wrong
22:11:00 <Camail> and people seem to like beer a lot
22:11:01 <skram> jerky isnt even a common food up here
22:11:01 <Crisium> you'll never get the seasonal blessings from your ancestors with that attitude skram
22:11:13 <skram> its all rotten fish and potato cris
22:11:15 <skram> dont lecture me

23:39:30 <reification> struggled to build a deck theme this time cam
23:39:48 <Camail> which one did you go for
23:39:51 <reification> think i prefer picking from the large pool of card at the start
23:40:08 <skram> bio, the boi
23:40:23 <Camail> i do too, drafting is harder
23:40:50 <Camail> but this one had some really good cards
23:41:08 <Camail> lots and lots of powers, then getting the hand late game really seals the deal
23:41:35 <reification> when you got the powers flowing it was fine
23:41:51 <Bio> how is ur faec skram
23:42:18 <reification> i switched into energy multiply -> X cards
23:42:52 <Camail> i did basically all ice orbs with the occasional lightning orb
23:44:35 <Camail> the first 15 were really strong, tho. there was energy generation, focus, frozen orb production, and good block cards
23:45:01 <skram> it is still attacked bio so not the worst probably
23:45:03 <skram> how you bean
23:46:53 <Bio> i was a good example at a work meeting
