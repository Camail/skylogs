20:13:47 <Dot> ot was like 20 degrees today
20:13:51 <Dot> 29*
20:14:41 <skram> Thats TOO MANY
20:15:05 <Dot> its a few
20:15:22 <Dot> had to scoop over 50 ice creams
20:15:42 <Dot> for OTHER people
20:16:12 <skram> thats heartbreaking

20:19:16 <Rawr|Fone> Yes
20:19:25 <Rawr|Fone> But you can tell me about it again
20:19:48 <skram> most important part

20:20:34 <Dot> let me find pictures of best dog at show

20:23:47 <Dot`> rawr, skram https://i.imgur.com/z6kAXRt.jpg
20:23:51 <Dot`> https://i.imgur.com/J1jo2Eg.jpg
20:24:05 <Dot`> look at the size of him, he is amazing
20:24:22 <Rawr|Fone> Absolute unit
20:24:31 <Rawr|Fone> What a great dog
20:24:35 <skram> why's he got a leash over his booper
20:24:35 <Dot`> yes
20:25:21 <Dot`> its far easier to control a dog as it pulls there head to the side, no pain or anything
20:25:43 <skram> well that makes sense
20:25:46 <Dot`> a lot of the dogs that have them on seem to be normaly off leash dogs 
20:25:58 <Dot`> so when they have a leash on they misbeahave as they are not use to it
20:28:51 <Dot`> Skram, irish wolf hounds on average weigh about 70-80 kg and can run at almost 60 kph
20:28:53 <Dot`> so cute
20:29:16 <skram> scary
20:29:30 <Dot`> very docile breed though
20:29:42 <Dot`> which is funny when you think they where bread to hunt wolves
20:29:45 <skram> what if you offend it somehow
20:30:11 <skram> sir your fur is dull
20:30:13 <Dot`> the larger the dog the harder that tends to be skram
20:30:20 <skram> and then suddenly it takes your arms off
20:30:46 <Dot`> unless you try push it away from its food or something and it is suprised larger dogs dont snap at ppl
20:31:47 <Dot`> skram i worry about your interactions with digs, they dont seem to have gone well
20:32:56 <skram> if a dog bred and trained to run down freakin mooses run after you, you dont stop because hey maybe that snarling monster just wants ear scritches
20:39:14 <Dot`> but it probably does
20:41:37 <skram> elkhounds are evil Dot`
