18:54:46 <Dot> steam sale started
18:56:42 <Camail> hmmmm
18:56:58 <Camail> gris looks cool, but not really my thing
18:57:07 <Camail> kinda like ori, for me
18:57:16 <Camail> i appreciate it but it doesnt grab me
18:57:55 <Camail> from what i've seen its just another platformer?
18:58:24 <Dot> reminded me of ori , so was curious if you knew any more
18:59:56 <Camail> just watched the ign gameplay
19:00:16 <Camail> it looked like a platformer, there weren't any deviations from the norm
19:00:37 <Camail> you have a hover/glide that makes new jumping puzzles with disappearing paltforms 
19:00:53 <Dot> so just pretty but no real stand out gameplay then, dissapointing
19:00:56 <Camail> so there is something different there
19:01:12 <Camail> but like...hovering is not a fun mechanic to me
19:01:38 <Camail> its very pretty, and if you like implicit story telling then that could be interesting
