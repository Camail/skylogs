02:52:22 <Camail> dub did you ever play hollow knight
02:54:27 <DuB`> nu
02:54:37 <Camail> thats a game i 100% advocate the piracy of!
02:54:47 <Camail> both dot and i stole it and eventually bought it
02:55:03 <Camail> everyone should steal it
02:55:07 <Camail> all yall
02:55:22 <Camail> i stole it for him 
02:55:43 <DuB`> How generous
02:57:50 <Camail> they've added 10% more game for free, so stealing 100% of the original game is only like stealing 91% of the game
02:58:10 <DuB`> Basically like giving the dev 9% money for free
02:58:13 <Camail> if anything that means I'm paying THEM to play
02:58:30 <Camail> now you understand
02:58:39 <Camail> that's why team cherry is amazing
02:59:35 <Bio> ah, i see you've seen that HK has updated cam
02:59:36 <Camail> and I've lived with my mark of shame, i play with my pre 1.0.4 patch shame 
02:59:49 <Camail> yes and i did the content that i could
02:59:53 <Camail> its only one boss tho
02:59:59 <Camail> cuz th eother content is new game only
03:00:29 <Bio> ic
03:00:43 <Camail> and even tho its my favorite game i still dont replay games so oh well
03:01:11 <Bio> yeh dub, plej the hollowest of knights
03:02:12 <Camail> i dunno if he likes platformers like this tho
03:02:56 <DuB`> I neved did finish Ori
03:03:33 <Camail> this is like ori but it holds an interest curve because [i have never played ori so i have 0 idea whats different]
03:03:44 <Camail> it has a combat system tho
03:04:03 <Camail> simple, but the enemies + platforming are where the combat become varied
03:04:20 <Camail> your options are simple but your interactions with the world and the enemies are what make it interesting
03:04:34 <Camail> also its adorable and creepy and mysterious
03:04:54 <Camail> I'm 10000% not trying to make you buy it, please dont take this as a sales pitch
03:04:57 <Bio> I think ud like ori cam

18:48:22 <Cane> I can tell you how to make it look good. Takes like 10 seconds.
18:48:59 <Camail> ask it nicely
18:50:05 <Cane> Bio?
18:50:24 <Bio> sorry
18:50:25 <Bio> was afk
18:50:25 <Bio> PLS
18:50:28 <Cane> Sure thing.
18:50:30 <Bio> tell me how to do the thing
18:50:42 <Cane> NetHack window's resolution is 640x300, so upscaling is easy.
18:50:54 <Cane> In OBS, add window capture for NetHack.exe, then add a filter to the capture.
18:51:05 <Cane> Add Scaling/Aspect Ratio, Scale Filtering: Point, Resolution: 1920x900
18:51:13 <Bio> game capture or window capture
18:51:24 <Cane> Window Capture, it doesn't know game capture as far as I know.
18:51:37 <Cane> Game cap works on like fullscreen apps mostly, modern games that use DirectX. It has various ways of figuring out what's a "game".
18:51:44 <Cane> NetHack is like a command window, it has no clue how to take that.
18:52:51 <Bio> I don't have 1920x900 in the dropdown
18:52:55 <Cane> Just input it.
18:52:58 <Cane> Dropdown is garbage.
18:53:10 <Cane> 1920x900 is exactly 3x that of 640x300, NetHack's actual resolution.
18:53:16 <Bio> k
18:53:19 <Cane> So if you upscale it exactly 3x you preserve the pixel ratio.
18:53:23 <Cane> Avoids it being blurry.
18:53:41 <Cane> Make sure it's set to Point filtering.
18:54:01 <Cane> And that's all you need, unless you want to key it out and use a background image like I am.

18:57:22 <Bio> does that look better?
18:58:09 <Cane> Better, but it looks like the aspect ratio is wrong.
18:58:19 <Cane> Did you stretch it in OBS?
18:58:39 <Bio> i made it fit to the screen, yeah
18:58:58 <Phearlock> Hello I am home
18:59:05 <Cane> Hi Phear. <3
18:59:17 <Phearlock> Hey cane
18:59:29 <Bio> argh i'm the worst
18:59:41 <Phearlock> It's T-shirt time down here now. Is it still frigid up at your place?
18:59:42 <Cane> Aww. <3
19:00:04 <Cane> Phear, it's been up and down. It was really warm a few days ago so I turned down all the floor heat, then it got cold again and I became a popsicle.
19:00:07 <Cane> Now it's better
19:00:39 <Phearlock> A meat popsicle you say?
19:01:02 <Cane> Bio, I can probably help you make it look gorgeous, but it looks fine as is. =)
19:01:14 <Cane> At least it's full screen now lol
19:01:45 <Cane> Oh you're streaming in 720p?
19:01:46 <Bio> I just want to figure out the process of making everything correct aspect-wise so when I want to do it for other games I don't look silly
19:02:18 <Bio> yeah, i have it scaled down cause my internet sucks
19:02:33 <Cane> Well for other games it doesn't matter too much, you just add a game capture and that's really it.
19:02:49 <Crisium> man, ranked is hell today
19:02:51 <Cane> For stuff like NetHack where there's actual pixel fonts it's just noticeable if your aspect ratio's wrong.
19:03:09 <Cane> And NetHack's ratio is 640x300, which makes none of the sense.
19:03:14 <Cane> It's like 1920x900.
19:03:16 <Bio> heh
19:03:28 <Bio> so for streaming in 720, i should go like...
19:03:49 <Cane> Set the scaling resolution to 1280x600
19:03:50 <Bio> 2x upwards?
19:03:52 <Cane> Yeah.
19:03:57 <Cane> That'll do.
19:04:00 <Cane> Should look more crisp.
19:04:09 <Cane> 'Cause right now you're upscaling it 3 times, then back down again to 2.
19:04:39 <Cane> Select the window capture in the scene, then press Ctrl+R to make sure it's sized properly.
19:04:46 <Cane> That'll reset the positioning etc.
19:04:57 <Cane> Hmm.
19:05:08 <Cane> Why is it not big enough?
19:05:47 <Cane> You're streaming at 1280x720, so setting the Scaling/Aspect Ratio of the capture to 1280x600 should at least fill it horizontally.
19:06:29 <Cane> Oh this looks better.
19:07:20 <Cane> Now you should turn your mic on or some shit. <3
19:07:25 <Bio> its like
19:07:40 <Bio> adjusting the window size affects the stream capture
19:07:49 <Bio> right now the application window is super small

19:08:02 <Cane> The window is tiny, I use the OBS preview window to play the game.
19:08:13 <Bio> yeah
19:08:13 <Cane> I just maximize OBS, or put the preview window on my main monitor and play from there.
19:08:17 <Bio> makes sense
19:08:26 <Cane> I definitely leave NetHack (the actual game app) window alone.
