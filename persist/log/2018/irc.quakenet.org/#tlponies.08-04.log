07:28:31 <Runbunny> The weird thing to happened to my computer.
07:28:36 <Runbunny> All the text was gone.
07:28:42 <Runbunny> Everything else was there.
07:28:55 <Dot`> that is weird
07:29:20 <Runbunny> I was very preplexed and slighty agitated.

23:45:21 <skram> water is the great enemy
23:46:02 <Dot> embarks are at the start of spring, so the game detects the frozen river  but as you start its spring so it thaws
23:46:06 <Dot> and everyone drowns
23:46:32 <Dot> good fun
23:47:08 <Dot> once the magic system is in i will go back to playing it

23:55:24 <skram> hah yeah
23:55:31 <skram> the df patch notes in general are terrific
23:56:11 <Dot> but do you know why it was happening?
23:56:20 <skram> i cant recall
23:56:39 <Dot> due to how stupidly complex cats are in the game
23:56:44 <Dot> because toady likes cats
23:56:52 <skram> good lad
23:57:13 <Dot> and the short of it was they walked through taverns with beer all over the floor
23:57:19 <Dot> that socked thier fur
23:57:28 <Dot> then they washed themselves
23:57:29 <skram> hahah yes
23:57:46 <Dot> and it counted as a full keg of ale
23:58:40 <skram> good fix
