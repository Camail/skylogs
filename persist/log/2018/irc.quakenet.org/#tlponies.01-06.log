01:26:30 <Camail> DuB`  had a huge skrimish in 256+ dz just now
01:27:01 <Camail> it was like 7-8 vs a group of 4 man hunt rogues, where we camped their objective for like 5 minutes
01:30:24 <Dot`> sounds like good pvp
01:36:19 <Camail> i nabbed a kill in the chaos, somehow
01:36:28 <Camail> 256+ is rough, its no holds barred
01:36:40 <Camail> i can barely even touch these people
01:38:52 <DuB`> D:
01:39:06 <DuB`> 180-200 tier is nice, very peaceful :D
01:39:13 <DuB`> Aaaaall alone

01:40:05 <DuB`> Nono alone is good in darkzone!
01:40:09 <DuB`> You get all the things
01:40:22 <Bio> the things are nice
01:40:59 <Camail> luckily i farmed hard pre fuck zone
01:41:10 <Camail> hopefully i can coast into tier 3 rewards tomorrow
01:41:18 <DuB`> O ya!
01:41:19 <Camail> but I'm doing bits and pieces today just to be sure
01:41:24 <DuB`> I think I'm at tier2 now, not sure
01:41:32 <DuB`> Will be nice to see what we get.

01:42:43 <Camail> I'm using that other bolt action that has a clip, cant recal the name. m7000 or something

23:48:38 <skrm> whats your sr atm
23:48:48 <Crisium> 3306? something like that
23:48:51 <Crisium> very low 3300
23:50:04 <skrm> we should stack and play tanks
23:50:11 <skrm> dps tanks is the key to winning
23:50:14 <skrm> probably maybe
23:50:34 <DuB`> ZARYE
23:50:46 <Crisium> maybe
23:51:09 <Crisium> im still best with zen
23:51:51 <skrm> zarya is out
23:51:54 <skrm> d.va is the shit
23:55:09 <Crisium> ya zarya is considered worst off tank
23:55:22 <Crisium> only pairs well with rein
23:55:27 <Crisium> but rein is worst main tank
23:55:35 <skrm> zen is goo becuase you can sort of compensate for the shitty dps
23:55:38 <Crisium> not a fan of this meta, hopefully mercy nerf is good for game
23:55:42 <Crisium> exactly skrm
23:56:05 <skrm> thats why d.va works too
23:56:14 <Crisium> yup
