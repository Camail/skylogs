17:36:20 <Zounds> my boy mccree with 9%
17:36:24 <Zounds> not bad for a dps
17:38:01 <Crisium> tied with Hanzo usage for 4th most used DPS
17:38:15 <Crisium> 5th actually
17:38:32 <Crisium> Sombra, Widow, Doomfist, Genji, Hanzo/McCree
17:39:53 <Zounds> Both hanzo and McCree my fave dps to play these days and both performing pretty good in pro play
17:40:04 <Zounds> feels alright man
17:41:14 <Crisium> meanwhile Sym and Torb are my fav DPS
17:41:17 <Crisium> 0%/1%
17:41:20 <Crisium> :D
17:43:10 <Zounds> >.<
17:44:20 <Crisium> Ashe is secretly a turret characters too btw
17:44:46 <Crisium> Bob becomes a turret after running
17:45:09 <Zounds> maybe you will enjoy her then
17:45:26 <Crisium> she can quick scope like Ana
17:45:32 <Crisium> i think there will be transferable skills
17:45:46 <Crisium> reason I cant widow is because im so used to quickscoping which widow cant do

18:09:50 <Dot> why you run away
18:10:03 <DuB`> SOmethign about opening pdfs breaks my computer really badly
18:10:09 <Dot> - At 6th levei, you can choose two more of your
18:10:09 <Dot> proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain
18:10:09 <Dot> this benefit.
18:10:16 <DuB`> Can't open my player's handbook, etc
18:10:18 <Dot> copy past from pdf is silly
18:10:37 <Dot> but you get to pick 2 more skills to double your proficiency in
18:11:36 <Dot> that seems to be it
18:11:38 <reification> you get ult unless you're playing something silly like meepo
18:11:53 <DuB`> Well I opened a different pdf so now i have to restart again

18:13:29 <Dot> not much for a rogue at lvl 6
18:14:19 <Dot> lvl 7 is evasion, so broken
18:15:23 <DuB`> Two more proficiencies
18:15:30 <DuB`> I'm already proficient at everything! ::
18:15:32 <DuB`> :P
18:15:54 <Dot> thieves tools?
18:18:50 <DuB`> Investigation and... 
18:18:51 <DuB`> hmmm
18:19:18 <DuB`> tools mebbe yeah
18:20:04 <DuB`> Wait how does that one work
18:20:43 <Dot> thieves tools are dex plus proficiency 
18:21:02 <Dot> and cant be used if you are not proficient in them
18:21:32 <DuB`> Am I supposed to be? Don't have it in tool proficiencies lol
18:21:46 <Dot> you do
18:21:50 <Dot> as a rogue
18:21:53 <DuB`> oke
18:22:52 <Dot> im very tempted to muticlass to sorceror for those extra spell slots and cantrips
18:23:43 <Dot> could even pick shadow sorceror and but skram with edgyness
18:23:44 <DuB`> Proficiency in 10 skills, expertise in 6
18:23:46 <DuB`> wew
18:23:49 <Dot> wtf dub
18:23:59 <Dot> is there anything akhat cant do?
18:24:06 <Dot> besides swim
18:24:10 <DuB`> Intimidation and perforamce!~
18:24:13 <DuB`> And swimming, yes :P
18:25:02 <Dot> you dont get 2 more proficiencies at lvl 6
18:25:08 <Dot> just get expertise in 2 you have
18:25:12 <DuB`> ya
18:25:22 <Dot> ah
18:25:27 <Dot> so you already had 10
18:25:29 <Dot> dam
18:25:32 <DuB`> ye
18:25:51 <DuB`> Rogue+outlander turned out perfectly for flavor AND ticking boxes in roll20! 
18:25:54 <DuB`> Haha
18:26:03 <Dot> lol
18:26:12 <Dot> rogues are good at doing things it seems
18:26:19 <Dot> once you get to lvl 11
18:26:22 <Dot> relaible talent
18:27:00 <DuB`> Literally always good
18:27:02 <DuB`> bahaha
18:27:21 <DuB`> Minimum 21 stealth
18:28:05 <DuB`> No idea what to do with score improvement on next level...
18:28:42 <Dot> you could pick a feat MR I  Have all the Good Stat Rolls
18:29:04 <DuB`> Could max Con! 
18:29:21 <DuB`> O ya, let's go look at feats
18:29:39 <Dot> dub, why you need con? you dont get hit and dont have concentration spells
18:29:59 <DuB`> Much of life of lively thx to con
18:30:01 <DuB`> I unno
18:30:41 <DuB`> Won't up my lowest stat, Cha, because flavor I guess
18:32:20 <DuB`> Dual Wielder is okayish, wouldn't care for the non-light weapons part anyway though
18:32:46 <Dot> could always get sharpshooter and be even more broken?
18:33:17 <DuB`> Or Skilled for THREE MORE TICKBOXES
18:33:20 <DuB`> ;D
18:33:27 <Dot> !!!!!
18:34:00 <DuB`> Yeah I probably will grab a feat, don't really care for more stats lol
18:34:02 <Dot> mage slayer
18:34:24 <DuB`> I REALLY wanted that one from the start because perfect flavor, but it seems eh
18:34:57 <DuB`> Have to be right on top of mage 100% of the time and they'r always in the back...
18:35:08 <Dot> haha
18:35:13 <Dot> mobiile is always good
18:36:02 <DuB`> If the mage slayer distance reqs were like 20 feat it would actually be fun and flexible...
18:36:07 <DuB`> But it's melee only
18:36:29 <DuB`> MObile would go nice with my 1/2 of movement reaction thing
