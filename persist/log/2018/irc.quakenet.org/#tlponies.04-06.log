15:48:36 <Zounds> Is it the stand in the cold and beat scabs with picket signs type of strike?
15:48:47 <Zounds> or the stay at home and wish you were being paid kind of strike
15:48:57 <skram> I dont know Zounds, the latter probably
15:49:24 <Dot`> you can come here and eat pizza while you have time off skram

16:00:37 <Crisium> at least whne i decay i get worse opponents
16:01:04 <DuB`> Not much though, hidden MMR is what really decides that
16:01:07 <DuB`> And doesn't decay.
16:01:22 <Crisium> even better then
16:01:36 <Crisium> so ill get more points for winning

16:59:51 <DuB`> I'm leaving in 30, will be back in 1-2 hrs
17:00:10 <Zounds> Cris decayed a bit right? maybe it's to help get him to his targeted MMR quicker
17:00:28 <DuB`> He decayed like 15SR :P
17:01:41 <Crisium> they might have made changes to stacking to prevent boosting
17:02:04 <DuB`> But I CARRIED! ;D
