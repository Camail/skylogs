00:01:00 <Camail> Bio  cr talks in 2 hours
00:01:23 <Camail> i should go back and watch that part, i wasnt really paying attention for a lot of that fight
00:01:32 <Camail> i kinda space out during fights
00:01:46 <Dot`> rip
00:02:13 <Dot`> fixing the party 1 character at a time
00:03:45 <Bio> haha
00:03:53 <Bio> it was super late when that fight happened
00:06:04 <Camail> just watched the moment, mercer finally actually takes a coup de grace
00:06:17 <Camail> i was paying attention literally 20 seconds before, i remember that part
00:06:38 <Camail> also wtf were people saying about the necklace
00:06:51 <Camail> it's totally irrelevant in this scenario
00:06:52 <Bio> they thought it would keep him alive
00:06:55 <Bio> but they are bad
00:07:01 <Camail> why the hell would they...
00:07:05 <Dot`> lol twitch chat
00:07:13 <Bio> cuz waah my fanart is R U I N E D
00:07:32 <Camail> like seriously i thought he bled to death, no it was a fucking coup
00:07:54 <Bio> coop de groop
00:08:23 <reification> night all
00:08:28 <Dot`> gnight reif
00:08:34 <Bio> nn
00:10:27 <Dot`> i havnt really looked when other characters died in the first campagn, but sam seemed to really be enjoying the incedent 
00:10:48 <Camail> the play was fine, he was maybe too eager to reduce his own hp, but someone was gonna die no matter what
00:11:12 <Camail> Dot` it was shock, because it's the first real death of the show
00:11:16 <Camail> they all knew it
00:12:04 <Camail> there's some video of pike's death, but it's not really well documented

00:12:54 <Camail> but yea, 100% there was gonna be a death, they weren't even close to winning, mercer could've made it a tpk
00:13:21 <Dot`> it didnt go well and was a tough fight to start with
00:14:35 <Dot`> i dont even know if they where suppose to be able to win
00:14:44 <Dot`> but dice, so you can never tell with PC's
00:16:57 <Camail> if they all go the surprise round, maybe
00:17:16 <Runbunny> I should sleep
00:17:24 <Camail> but surprise rounds in 5e are OP
00:17:30 <Dot`> gnight runbun
00:17:38 <Camail> run no

00:28:59 <Cane> Hi folks. <3
00:29:35 <Cane> Was awake for 21 hours yesterday. Slept for ~5. This is in no way coming back to bite me in the ass.
00:30:14 <Dot`> weird cane, your sleeping patterns are normaly so good
00:30:52 <Cane> lol that made me laugh, cheers Dot` <3
00:30:59 <Dot`> <3
00:31:01 <Cane> I pictured you saying that in the most deadpan voice possible.
00:31:38 <Dot`> im glad you know me so well
00:31:57 <Bio> silly cane
00:41:08 <Dot`> how does one sleep though?
00:42:08 <Dot`> cane, is Rael improving?
00:42:39 <Cane> He actually dropped by last night saying he's allowed to do things again.
00:42:50 <Cane> Doctor said he's improving and he can get back into the swing of things, just take things slow at first.
00:42:57 <Dot`> huzzah
00:43:00 <Cane> But otherwise yeah, all better.
00:43:16 <Cane> Gonna try catching up on Brood War pretty soon. =)
00:44:13 <Dot`> nice
00:45:28 <Dot`> glad to hear he is improving
00:45:51 <Dot`> he should not fight steps in the future
00:48:10 <Bio> they usually win in my experience
00:48:54 <Cane> Rael says "you should have seen the other guy."

00:49:06 <Raelcun> I heard people were talking shit
00:49:15 <Dot`> always
00:49:25 <Raelcun> I definitely won. I didn't even get knocked out.
00:49:29 <Raelcun> Now that step doesn't even exist anymore.
00:49:34 <Dot`> we heard you couldnt even defeeat a flight of stairs
00:49:54 <Raelcun> I think I did.
00:50:06 <Raelcun> I pointed at it and said. "Get that step out of here." and it was gone from the room.
00:50:19 <Cane> Rael got his friends to beat it up for him.
00:50:22 <Dot`> well the stairs havnt shown up here to defend themselves
00:50:30 <Raelcun> They can't
00:50:34 <Dot`> so your argument seems to have merit
00:50:54 <Raelcun> Also hi.
00:51:06 <Cane> People here have been asking for updates the past week or so Rael. <3
00:51:11 <Dot`> Hello
00:51:21 <Dot`> did you get to read many books?
00:51:22 <Raelcun> Yeah I wasn't allowed to really screens
00:51:27 <Raelcun> Wasn't allowed to read either.
00:51:38 <Raelcun> Had to just do nothing, kept badgering people to talk to me on discord.
00:51:40 <Dot`> did you stair blankly outa window?
00:51:42 <Raelcun> I listened to some vods.
00:51:46 <Raelcun> Because i wasn'ta llowed to watch
00:51:51 <Raelcun> Slept a lot.
00:53:27 <Dot`> thats rough
00:53:45 <Dot`> you should have got Bio to read to you
00:53:58 <Cane> Rael's nanny says he's allowed to watch TV again so long as he promises to do it in moderation.-
00:54:20 <Dot`> and eat his vegetables
00:55:03 <Bio> ruff life
00:55:53 <CockRoach|42> hors hors
00:56:21 <Raelcun> `m~
00:57:20 <CockRoach|42> rael!
00:57:26 <Cane> I thought Rael was all better but his fingers look all fucked up.
00:57:57 <Raelcun> that's a horse
00:58:00 <Raelcun> not a metal hand
00:58:17 <Cane> Everything is a metal hand if you squint hard enough.
00:58:19 <Raelcun> \m/ dat's a metal hand

09:36:13 <Cane> Fantastic.
09:36:27 <Cane> It's apparently a super long game if you do all the side content.
09:37:22 <skram> Well when they spent about 15 dollarydoos on graphics and 9000 on walking animations im sure there was some left for storywriting :P
