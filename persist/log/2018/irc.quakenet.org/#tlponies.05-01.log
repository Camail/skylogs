16:40:10 <Dot`> for a MONTH
16:40:19 <DuB`> A MONTH?
16:40:25 <DuB`> This is goot
16:40:32 <Dot`> this is my first prescription drug since i was like 4
16:41:59 <skrm> is it the good stuff?
16:42:10 <Dot`> we shall see if it works
16:42:28 <Dot`> its probably weaker than over the counter stuff in SA :P
16:43:41 <skrm> what ails you buddy

16:44:13 <Dot`> thats my plan runbun
16:46:05 <Dot`> inflamed stomach lining due to stress probably
16:46:18 <Dot`> which leads to an imbalance which makes the inflamation worse and round and round
16:46:32 <DuB`> Ach
16:47:15 <Dot`> apparently anytihng to do with stomach acid/wall gets called indegestian
16:47:15 <Dot`> lol
16:48:10 <skrm> hopefully it will work
16:48:20 <skrm> are you playing the multiplayer stardew valley thing though
16:48:32 <Dot`> no, just some SP atm
16:48:43 <skrm> do you wanna plej when i get home from work
16:49:01 <Dot`> i hope it works too skram, its been 2 weeks of increasing pain 
16:49:07 <Dot`> and i didnt get much sleep last night
16:49:11 <skrm> or do you have to buy the multiplayer version seperately
16:49:22 <DuB`> It's open beta
16:49:43 <skrm> fingers crossed bjørn old bean
16:49:43 <DuB`> Right click on SDV in steam -> properties -> beta tab
16:49:55 <DuB`> Then there's a code you have to put in which I should find again...
16:50:41 <DuB`> Man
16:50:51 <DuB`> SDV is like Animal Crossing x 1000
16:51:01 <DuB`> With actual things to do and progression and direction :P
16:51:25 <skrm> its SO slow paced though
16:51:39 <DuB`> Hmmm
16:51:41 <DuB`> Yeah
16:52:12 <DuB`> I wish watering a small garden didn't kill your whole day of energy
16:52:43 <Dot`> you ssay slow paced skram, but also there is so much to do and never enough time
16:52:56 <Dot`> Dub, geting that gold watering can is so important
16:53:21 <Runbunny> yeah it's quite stressful actually.
16:53:39 <DuB`> 10,000g
16:53:44 <DuB`> I have only 3k!
16:54:27 <skrm> im gonna go do work
