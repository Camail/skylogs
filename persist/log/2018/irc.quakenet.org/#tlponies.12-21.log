02:37:25 <Runbunny> Ever been so tired that you couldn't sleep?
02:49:29 <Camail> stop that
02:50:17 <Runbunny> I sure am trying
03:13:27 <Camail> dub how goes the paper
03:17:36 <DuB`> I played brawlhalla and division with friends :P
03:17:46 <DuB`> Tried quake but new update broke literally everything and we couldn't
03:17:53 <DuB`> Writing now!
03:18:30 <Camail> oh what, how did you get them into the division
03:18:53 <DuB`> One friend is randomly a fan of anything tom clancy, and brother and I already had it
03:18:57 <DuB`> Play with the 3 of us
03:19:01 <Camail> nice
03:19:03 <DuB`> ... my brother is the worst
03:19:10 <DuB`> He shoots every street dog on sight T_T
03:19:15 <Camail> if you get to late game i'll play
03:19:17 <Camail> ....wow
03:19:34 <Camail> thats a little fucked up tho
03:20:43 <Camail> man so much tension on cr
03:21:10 <DuB`> Brawhalla is decent, with more than 7 characters out of like 40 were free 
03:21:14 <DuB`> wish*

03:24:38 <DuB`> 7 doesn't feel like a lot of variety when you're playing with 4 people :P
03:27:07 <Camail> depends on the characters, honestly
03:27:42 <Camail> there really aren't that many playstyles in fighting games, so it's probably enough
03:27:58 <Camail> but i guess most people dont play smash-likes like fighting games
03:44:16 <Camail> ASHLEY
03:44:19 <Camail> AHHHHH ASHLEYYYYY
04:02:05 <Camail> i love cad so much
04:32:53 <Camail> crosscode is on sale
04:33:06 <Camail> i strongly strongly recommend it, it is a very good game
04:33:22 <Camail> dragons dogma is super cheap, also a great game
04:55:07 <Camail> YASHAAAAA
05:32:04 <DuB`> It is done an I am free!
05:32:06 <DuB`> ... now what?
05:37:19 <Camail> hmm
05:37:29 <Camail> go play a space, probably
05:37:35 <DuB`> Oooh
05:37:41 <DuB`> That's a good one
05:37:56 <Camail> me and dot were thinking this weekend would be a good time for some TTS, btw
05:38:05 <DuB`> Saw that a some of my favorite Big Mods were updated for newest stellaris overhaul
05:38:19 <Camail> delicious mods

19:06:07 <Dot`> useless internet
19:06:41 <Camail_> my internet today has been really spotty
19:33:19 * skram slaps Dot` around a bit with a large trout
19:41:38 <Dot`> oi
19:42:34 <skram> what you up to doot
19:52:10 <Runbunny> Getting slapped with a fish apparently.
19:54:09 <Dot`> ii am talking to brother
19:54:37 <skram> does he have any l√∂√∂ps
19:57:22 <Dot`> no :(
19:59:21 <skram> augh
20:02:10 <Dot`> skram, why do the socks have a tag
20:02:30 <skram> it says how to wash
20:06:30 <Camail> moonlighter is on sale
20:06:35 <Camail> also a very good game
20:11:33 <Runbunny> Is it Recettear? 
20:12:49 <Dot`> did a granny not knit these socks skram? are they not geniune norwegion granny hand knitted socks?
20:13:53 <Camail> its kinda like recettear but better, imo
20:14:01 <Camail> there's no magical debt clock
20:14:09 <Camail> which i hated, and it made me quit the game
20:14:22 <skram> all the grannies had full schedules so my coworkers wife did it, Dot`
20:14:23 <Camail> and no dumb wallet mechanic which i hated and made me quit that game
20:15:06 <Camail> Runbunny  it is like 70% about dungeoneering and and 30% about selling
20:15:40 <Camail> the selling is pretty simple, but it enforces the RPG progress curve REALLY well
20:16:41 <Runbunny> Hmm.
20:16:50 <Runbunny> I liked Recettear.
20:17:12 <Camail> it intentionally misleads you
20:17:17 <Camail> it literally wants you to fail
20:17:23 <Camail> i hated it so much
20:17:31 <Runbunny> Yeah
20:17:39 <Runbunny> But that was all just a dream.
20:17:44 <Camail> haggling is encourages in the tutorial
20:17:48 <Camail> and discouraged in mecahnics
20:18:42 <Runbunny> And just when you have a nice streak going the scam artist comes by and ruins your combo.
20:19:54 <Camail> also the combat was terrible
20:20:15 <Camail> and they never really explain any of the ways to play well
20:20:18 <Runbunny> Yeah the actual dungeons were rather rough.
20:20:34 <Camail> w/e i'll stop talking about it, i dont want to get angry right now
20:20:43 <Camail> the point is, moonlighter is great
20:20:56 <Camail> the art style is really fun, th einventory management is REALLY neat
20:21:01 <Camail> like, really clever
20:21:08 <Runbunny> GOG reviewers aren't impressed.
20:21:20 <Runbunny> I'll certain take a look at it at some point.
20:21:23 <Camail> you have a set amount of backpack space while adventuring, and some items have curses, which affect the items near it
20:21:37 <Dot`> cam pls, calm down
20:21:43 <Camail> i already did!
20:21:47 <Camail> you always come in too late
20:22:33 <Camail> the selling is mostly a reward for good play in the dungeon
20:22:47 <Camail> you keep testing your luck trying tog et more, or replace trash items with good items
20:26:32 <Camail> i would have liked it if the supply/demand economics were were severe, that's the only thing i'd change
20:34:01 <Zounds> I liked Recettear quite a bit
20:34:05 <Zounds> never dungeoned much though
20:35:43 <Zounds> I want to sell adventurers items for their dungeon runs in my shoppe not do them myself
20:35:48 <Zounds> so many other games for that
20:37:37 <Runbunny> Just sell adventures.
20:37:50 <Camail> my experience in recc was just selling food
20:38:44 <Camail> ok i gotta leave befor ei say something i'll regret
20:39:13 <Zounds> It's not like we're the devs of recettear and going to be offended
20:40:21 <skram> well you never know
20:40:27 <Runbunny> He was about to do the thing again.
20:40:34 <Zounds> I think he was gonna say the N word
20:40:34 <Runbunny> I cried for 3 hours last time.
20:40:38 <Runbunny> No no.
20:40:46 <Runbunny> Far more severe.
