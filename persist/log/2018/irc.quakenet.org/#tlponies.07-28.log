01:05:39 <DuB`> Also space
01:06:08 <skrma> well theres a lot of it
01:06:13 <DuB`> Now I can stop pretending to be an astrosplorer in Space Engine and ACTUALLY astrosplore
01:06:47 <skrma> We made poo iglos and stole eggs from the evil bugs
01:07:14 <DuB`> :D
01:07:24 <DuB`> I would like my own poogloo
01:07:40 <DuB`> (If my net allows stable connection)
01:08:03 <DuB`> Also, leaving this podunk east bay town in 2 week, back to good net
01:08:19 <skrma> woo!
01:08:55 <skrma> I went to an actual town yesterday and ate food
01:09:08 <skrma> such decadence
01:09:17 <DuB`> wew
01:09:26 <DuB`> SF is a USA Top 3 food city!
01:09:38 <DuB`> I get a different thing for lunch every day :D
01:10:13 <skrma> well I get all the boiled liver I can eat for lunch'
01:10:58 <DuB`> the wat now...
01:11:30 <DuB`> I got an onigiri with wasabi and tuna salad, and another with teriyaki tofu
01:11:37 <DuB`> v gud
01:12:02 <skrma> so metropolitan
01:13:03 <skrma> DuB`: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FsxEYU5v4k
01:13:30 <DuB`> Also my assigned "buddy" mentor quit amidst drama and was escorted out of the building
01:13:36 <DuB`> So that was exciting
01:13:37 <DuB`> rofl
01:13:49 <skrma> wait hold on
01:14:01 <skrma> tell me about this drama
01:14:11 <DuB`> oke
01:14:11 <DuB`> so
01:14:11 <skrma> is it because you put tuna in the breakroom microwave
01:14:15 <DuB`> lolol
01:15:00 <DuB`> Our State and Local tax team is 2 partners, 2 managers, and 4 or 5 regular staff
01:15:20 <DuB`> Everyone but the partners and 1 manager knew she was gonna leave and had an offer from a competitor firm for the whole week
01:15:51 <DuB`> She had... aired some grievances... to a few of us in private
01:16:27 <DuB`> So we were all sittin' there this morning knowing she's about to drop this news on our boss outta nowhere
01:17:12 <DuB`> He didn't take it super well (understandably, I think)
01:17:18 <skrma> Its always good to burn your bridges on the way out
01:17:45 <DuB`> She intended it to be her prior notice of resignation or whatever, and was gonna stay next week
01:18:25 <DuB`> But boss invoked a policy about people moving to competitors where you have to leave immediately upon announcing - meant to protect confidential info and client relationships, etc
01:18:56 <DuB`> So boss and the rest of the team went out for coffee while she immediately cleared out her station and was escorted out of the building by HR folks
01:19:22 <DuB`> We went back upstairs, her desk was empty, and we resumed work as usual :P
01:19:27 <skrma> She sounds like a bit of a bitch, DuB`
01:19:28 <Crisium> nice
01:19:31 <Crisium> be gone!
01:19:36 <DuB`> lol
01:19:38 <DuB`> I mean
01:20:00 <DuB`> A lot of her complaints were reasonable
01:20:04 <DuB`> But she was
01:20:20 <DuB`> And a lot of her complaints were things that didn't need to be bottled up and could have been discussed with boss
01:20:41 <DuB`> 30% pay raise at competitor firm, too...
01:20:54 <skrma> oh dang
01:21:06 <skrma> for that kind of pay raise id even throw in a temper tantrum
01:21:13 <DuB`> ;D
01:21:49 <DuB`> It's one of the firms I'll be interviewing with for fulltime for next year 
01:22:02 <DuB`> So... I guess I have an inside reference now? :P
01:22:08 <skrma> hell yeah
01:23:41 <DuB`> Anyway
01:24:18 <DuB`> I've been killin' it, bossman likes me and said right out that I'd have a fulltime offer waiting for me at the end of the internship
01:24:48 <skrma> fuck yeah buddy
01:25:30 <DuB`> Right now I think I'd rather go Big 4 firm, but it's good to have option as backup or whatevs
01:25:46 <skrma> well at least you have something
01:26:06 <DuB`> yepyep
01:26:18 <skrma> finishing school and then having nothing to go to is a super shitty feeling

15:31:57 <skram> kris!
15:32:14 <Cane> wtf skram, can I come live with you?
15:32:18 <skram> I have also been promised thunderstorms all night long
15:32:27 <Cane> I ASK AGAIN
15:32:34 <Cane> PLS
15:33:28 <skram> Cane I live in a 100 year old bulding built in massive timber, by the time its 22c inside its probably 30 outside again
15:33:47 <Crisium> skram is so old
15:34:03 <Cane> To be honest I'd rather be at Spa today.
15:35:00 <Cane> Lulled to sleep by the comforting sounds of sixty-three V8 GT3 engines.
15:35:01 <skram> agreed
15:35:55 <skram> the bentley looks great though
15:36:12 <skram> its a race car with that a posh radiator grille
15:37:10 <Cane> Oh god yeah, and it's been doing really well so far.
15:37:54 <Cane> Here's the Aston Martin V8 Vantage onboard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s6-8b8V24A
15:38:02 <Cane> Er, V12.
15:38:04 <Cane> So used to saying V8.
15:38:13 <Cane> But we've got a V12 here today.
15:39:06 <skram> is that a suede leather dash in the aston
15:39:32 <Cane> Well, of course darling, it's an Aston.
15:39:38 <skram> haha
15:40:12 <skram> merc looks pretty posh too
15:40:59 <Cane> AMG GT3 is one of my all time favorite cars. I tend to cheer for them whenever they're racing (and one of my favorite teams, Black Falcon, is fielding THREE today), and yet...
15:41:02 <Cane> I may be rooting f or the Aston.
15:41:32 <skram> The black falcons should have better looking liveries honestly
15:41:36 <Cane> I'll grant you that the Lamborghini looks really good going around the track...
15:41:37 <skram> the green one is pretty neat though
15:42:02 <Cane> Oh, and Earl Bramber & co. are back in the Porsche.
15:42:49 <skram> porsches are cool and all but the 911 is too pedestrian

17:14:38 <Dot> but why would you want to turn more than 1 way in a race?
17:15:03 <skram> thats not true at all
17:15:06 <skram> you turn TWICE per lap
17:15:39 <Cane> DuB`!
17:15:41 <Cane> There you are. <3
17:15:51 <Cane> Managed to tune in huh?

17:18:13 <DuB`> Bentley in close 4th, huh :o
17:18:33 <DuB`> Go away dumb lambo, let the audi run up to fight for 1st!
17:19:03 <Cane> Yeah, the Bentley's been good the whole way.

17:26:06 <skram> despite making cars mostly for people who play football and have bath tubs with claw feet on them, Bentley has a looong racing history dubster
17:27:28 <Cane> Oh crap.
17:27:39 <Cane> That's the other V12 Vantage. =(

17:44:38 <Cane> Hey Runbunny. <3
17:45:28 <Cane> Bentley and Lexus in the lead. Won't last but I like seeing it.
17:48:21 <Cane> lol that's a Lamborghini with ripped off body work.
17:48:42 <Cane> "You may have some aero damage. Pit if you feel your lap times slowing down."
17:49:08 <Runbunny> Hai.
17:52:08 <Cane> DuB`, I don't suppose https://www.total24hours.com/live would work for you? Dunno which restream you're watching.
17:52:23 <Cane> That one's lagging for me a bit.
17:52:31 <Cane> I'm happy the YouTube thing works for me tbh.
17:53:41 <DuB`> I'm on http://acesports.win/motors.php
17:53:56 <Cane> Yeah I figured, just trying to give you alternatives in case it's butty.
18:05:09 <Dot> skram, when is dnd?

18:09:19 <Dot> bio was around
18:09:31 <skram> he's prepping i think
18:09:37 <Bio> we're not starting early
18:09:46 <Bio> i've gotten almost no prep done as is
18:10:30 <skram> He had him a run to make, Dot
18:10:43 <skram> there's beer in texarkana and the boys are thirsty up in atlanta
18:10:56 <Dot> that all makes no sense to me
18:11:20 <skram> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHZJej98_T0

18:19:21 <skram> im still waiting for those useless fucks at the post office
18:19:34 <Dot> go visit them

18:19:47 <Zounds> friggin' internet
18:19:47 <skram> well
18:19:53 <Dot> Zounds :/
18:19:57 <skram> not the post office, the post terminal warehouse thing
18:20:24 <skram> and if it was the proper royal mail types it would have been here forever ago, but its some private shipping company that sucks big ass
18:32:10 <Dot> rude
18:32:41 <Dot> hows no mans sky going?
18:32:55 <skram> im building a base
18:33:20 <Dot> fancy
18:33:21 -!- Micen [~Micen@h125.70.91.75.dynamic.ip.windstream.net] has joined #tlponies
18:34:37 <skram> its alright
18:34:48 <skram> easily worth the 30 dollarydoos it cost
18:36:20 <Micen> What is?
18:36:34 <skram> no mans sky
18:37:06 <skram> if it was released as an indie game it probably would've been brilliant from the start
18:37:50 <Phearlock> Yeah, if this was like the 1.0 patch of a game coming out of early access
18:37:56 <Cane> I think the world hated that it was billed as a AAA game with tons of ambition and sold for $60 as an epic experience.
18:37:58 <Phearlock> People would have been all over it
18:38:14 <Phearlock> But yeah I'm happy with it so far.
18:38:16 <Phearlock> It's cozy =3
18:38:23 <Cane> I like cozy. <3
18:38:47 <skram> also doesnt help that it was hyped to hell and fell short by a dang mile
18:39:14 <Phearlock> I mean it doesn't come close to subnautica for exploration. But that's a tough mark to hit. =P
18:39:29 <Phearlock> Handcrafted vs procedural etc
18:40:38 <Dot> im torn if i shold get it while its on sale
18:47:49 <Cane> Well, snap. Two Bentleys in the top 4.
18:54:10 <Cane> skram, DuB`, either of you know the technical difference between amateur and professional amateur?
18:54:13 <Cane> AM/PAM
18:54:45 <Bio> probably pay
18:55:09 <Cane> That's usually the distinction between amateur and professional, I just wonder if there's more to it.
18:55:23 <Cane> Classes in motorsports can be kind of weird.
18:55:40 <skram> yeah i got no idea
18:58:31 <Dot> dont be late skram
18:58:46 <skram> a wizard is never late
18:58:53 <skram> barbarians are though
18:59:03 <Phearlock> It's true, I'm already there
19:00:18 <Dot> dub? how the internet today?
19:00:33 <Zounds> pro-ams get paid but usually not enough for a full time job
20:13:03 <Zounds> Crisium
20:13:10 <Zounds> feel like playing any OW?
20:20:30 <Cane> Woah that's a hell of a shot of the blood moon.

21:14:01 <DuB`> I want to know why I can turn on both OWL finals stream and Spa 24h race stream just fine
21:14:15 <DuB`> But can't hear 3/4 of what is said on discord and have 2k ping
21:17:03 <Cane> Um. Hm.
21:17:08 <Cane> DuB`, want to try a different Discord server?
21:17:11 <Cane> Or is it all Discord servers?
21:17:41 <DuB`> It's been like this all summer with my crappy wifi setup
21:17:43 <DuB`> Dunno
21:17:44 <Dot> yea dubm we can move to the tlp discord see if it helps
21:18:06 <Cane> Dot can change the TLP Discord's server location a bunch too.
21:18:17 <Dot> sounds fancy
21:20:32 <Cane> Yeah, just right click server -> server settings -> overview -> server region. Change that.
21:20:45 <Dot> i found it after you mentioned it
21:20:46 <Cane> Maybe DuB` just has a shit connection to whatever region the server is in.
21:20:48 <Cane> Mmhmm.
21:21:16 <Cane> You could also make sure the channel you're in isn't using a 192837189263891723 bitrate or whatever.
21:21:37 <Cane> Just stick with 64 or below.
21:22:26 <Cane> Dot ^
21:22:41 <Dot> where do i see that one?
21:22:46 <Cane> Wheel icon on the channel.
21:22:50 <Cane> Edit Channel.
21:22:56 <Cane> Bitrate is under Overview again.
21:23:44 <Dot> ah, skram found it
21:23:47 <Dot> its on 64
