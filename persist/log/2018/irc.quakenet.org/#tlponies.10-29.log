19:59:52 <Runbunny> Hit people with axes.
20:00:00 <Runbunny> It's FFXIV
20:04:11 <Zounds> I intend to hit them runbun
20:04:18 <Zounds> thing is, they hit me too
20:04:25 <Zounds> I've been told that's the point but it's upsetting
20:06:02 <Dot> sounds rude
20:06:12 <Runbunny> It's alright.
20:06:30 <Camail> are deep dungeons still the best xp grind
20:06:46 <Runbunny> As long as you make sure everything is hitting you.
20:09:35 <Runbunny> I don't know. I haven't done the thing yet.
20:09:50 <Zounds> I haven't done one yet
20:10:03 <Zounds> I think they are good if there is long queues for dps in roulette
20:10:19 <Zounds> but queues have been pretty good for dps when I've been playing ninja
20:13:52 <Camail> dailies and weeklies are the only time i did dungeons other than for msq
20:14:12 <Camail> deep dungeons gave sooo much xp and also gave you an end game weapon
