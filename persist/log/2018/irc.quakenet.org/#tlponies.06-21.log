22:19:25 <Crisium> we do play it
22:19:30 <Camail> ok
22:21:00 <Dot> wasnt it free?
22:21:58 <Camail> yea but it has free to play mechanics
22:22:51 <Crisium> $30 for the get all heroes version
22:22:59 <Crisium> on sale now for $20
22:23:28 <Runbunny> It was free.
22:23:37 <Runbunny> but you can't get it currently for free.
22:23:37 <Crisium> its still free for the base version for now
22:23:40 <Camail> it's worth investing because a sizeable number of tlp likes it
22:23:52 <Camail> yea you can get a free version
22:23:57 <Runbunny> Still?
22:24:06 <Crisium> either still or they did it again for summer sale
22:24:11 <Runbunny> Ahh.
22:24:12 <Camail> there's 3 options in the store, free, buy it, and upgrade your free version
22:24:59 <Camail> skram i used the chainblade build on the bug
22:25:03 <Camail> and it worked really well
22:25:52 <Camail> high part brake, flexible interrupts, amazing move speed, and multihit moves all meant for an easier fight
22:25:57 <Camail> break*
22:26:40 <Camail> i still have a free copy of trine 2 in my inventory

22:54:13 <Camail> that's a good show

22:59:18 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIyrHAzlGxs
23:02:44 <Camail> that last clip is NUTS
23:03:37 <Camail> if desk started branching out like this instead of just doing combo videos i'd be happy
23:04:25 <Camail> also HOLLOW KNIGHT IS $10 FUCKING BUY IT
23:04:46 <skram> cam this is exactly like those COD trick shot videos all the kool kids did some years back
23:04:51 <Camail> i would not think it is hyperbole to say that it is the best game on stream at $10 and under
23:05:01 <Camail> not the last clip cris
23:05:15 <Crisium> the double chun?
23:05:28 <Camail> and i disagree in general, too
23:05:52 <Camail> in cod its just people trying to do  it a bunch of time in multiplayer until it happens, right?
23:06:13 <Camail> this is purely technical stunts done with self imposed restrictions
23:06:41 <Camail> the fuerte one was crazy too
23:06:49 <Camail> infinitely more difficult than anything done in cod
23:07:16 <skram> just like 360 noscoping
23:07:39 <Camail> being able to elarn the RSF timing with multiple hands
23:08:21 <Camail> pretty sure desk i the only one in the world who could do that or the chun clip

23:10:02 <Runbunny> Hmm. Aparently a lot of games has a spyware thingy in it.
23:10:11 <Runbunny> Something called redshell.
23:10:30 <Runbunny> It appears that quake champions also has that :/
23:11:07 <Crisium> that cant be right
23:12:06 <Runbunny> https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/8pud8b/psa_red_shell_spyware_holy_potatoes_were_in_space/
23:12:11 <Camail> initial googling says it's true
23:12:24 <Camail> it's not malware, but it is pretty shitty
23:12:39 <Camail> they'll remove it due to backlash soon
23:12:46 <Runbunny> hopefully
23:13:04 <Crisium> lame
23:13:08 <Runbunny> The thing with quake, is that it seems it's the first game to have it integrate directly into the game.
23:17:25 <Camail> https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/8rxfpc/batch_file_to_block_redshell_new_steam_spyware/
23:17:39 <Camail> until then you can block all network access to their site
23:17:48 <Camail> so your computer will collect it then hit a wall
23:20:21 <Camail> i just went into my hosts file and added those ip/domain combos
