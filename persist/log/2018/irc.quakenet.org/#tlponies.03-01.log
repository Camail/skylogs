00:36:11 <DuB`> Oberwaj
00:36:13 <DuB`> Without dot :(
00:37:03 <Dot`> i almost did tonight, then I had supper and then the stack was full when i got back
00:43:15 <Crisium> waching owl
00:48:34 <Camail> owls are very watchable
01:04:16 <DuB`> YES
01:15:09 <Micen> good morning
01:17:19 <Runbunny> I really need to sleep.
01:19:46 <Camail> do that
01:58:12 <carcinisation> night all
03:53:28 <Phearlock> http://i.4cdn.org/mlp/1519858693415.jpg silly fighting animals
06:46:25 <Camail> combos in tfh are kinda easy, and its helllla easy to convert hits into combos, at least for paprika
07:12:06 <Rawr|Phone> Do you like the game camail
07:15:20 <Camail> I don't know yet. I'm worried it might become too slow because the damage is low, the combos are long, and it is hard to maintain offensive pressure because of all of the defensive tools
07:15:26 <Camail> but that means more neutral, which i like
07:15:45 <Camail> also it's very unfinished so it doesn't quite have a good feeling to a lot of the animations
07:15:56 <Camail> but that comes with time
07:17:10 <Camail> tons of movement options, tons of defensive options, not a lot of offensive options, but many of the neutral hits you get will lead to damage, and if you read their defensive escapes right you can continue pressure for one more guess
07:17:36 <Camail> gonna have to see it played more, and at a higher level than what I've faced so far
07:17:58 <Camail> right now i can just short hop to victory because people don't know how to pushblock
07:18:41 <Rawr|Phone> I might try it
07:18:48 <Camail> it's certainly not bad, they aren't try anything groundbreaking with the designs, every mechanic has existed in another game
07:19:02 <Camail> so its not very risky which means it can't be fundamentally broken
07:19:19 <Camail> its very simple to get into, so might as well
07:19:48 <Camail> its not DBFZ levels of casual at low levels, but its only got 4 buttons and only 3 of those are used a lot
07:20:05 <Camail> the magic mechanic is pretty neat, every character has a different implementation of it
07:20:36 <Camail> twilight has magic as her fireball and she has a special move to restore her magic, basically juri-style but as a zoner and not as a way to get in
07:20:59 <Camail> i only know my characters name so i just call the others by their slave names
07:22:06 <Camail> low level matches are gonna take FOREVER tho cuz no one knows how to deal any damage
07:23:22 <Camail> at best a full combo is doing 25% damage, which isn't bad. People who can't do them are gonna be doing very little damage
07:24:04 <Camail> like many anime games, the combos come in loops, if you can't complete a loop then you are doing 5-10% damage per successful hit
07:25:17 <Camail> basically, pick it up, learn to love your chosen pony equivalent, then git gud
07:40:20 <Rawr|Phone> I hope the player base isn't gone by the time I pick it up
07:55:12 <Camail> you'll have phear and dot to play with, I'm sure
07:55:39 <Camail> I'll play but dunno how fun that will be for anyone else
07:57:57 <Rawr|Phone> Maybe we will just have to git gud
07:59:29 <Camail> as long as you can beat the scrubs, its gud enuff

09:29:27 <Rawr|Fone> About to take the last test in school

09:41:47 <Micen|Droid> Morning.
09:42:27 <Dot`> hey micen
09:42:41 <Dot`> Golly, how is Into the Breach?
09:44:45 <Rawr|Fone> Hopefully ever dot
09:44:59 <Rawr|Fone> Then 12 weeks of unpaid work and I'm done
09:46:24 <Golly> It really scratches that puzzle solving itch, Dot
09:46:58 <Dot`> Nice rawr! gl hest <3
09:47:31 <Dot`> hmmm, that game keeps sounding better golly
09:47:43 <Golly> its solid
09:48:10 <Golly> only small complaint is some of the robots have moves which are hard to use
09:49:42 <Golly> and uh, the way to unlock stuff is kinda annoying like in ftl
09:50:27 <Dot`> weird objectives to unlock things?
09:51:05 <Golly> yeah, getting achievements
09:51:57 <Golly> which often in practice means playing sub optimally in order to get them, which is a bad game mechanic in my book
09:52:23 <Dot`> hmmm
09:55:12 <Rawr|Fone> Dot have you seen wargroove
09:58:16 <Dot`> no i have not rawr

10:07:30 <Rawr|Fone> Great
10:07:39 <Dot`> one can hope
10:07:53 <Dot`> Wesnoth is still getitng updates it seems
10:19:19 <Rawr|Fone> Maybe we can play one day

15:39:09 <DuB_phone> I mean, I still prefer Japan rules where you can get in trouble just for walking around with a fake sword, let alone a gun
15:39:12 <Zounds> Though with something like guns living here in the UK with no interest it's easy for me to say I guess it's good :P
15:39:45 <Zounds> But I understand parts of America take personal liberty pretty seriously
15:39:49 <DuB_phone> Guns are yucky
15:39:59 <Zounds> even if it comes off as hypocritical sometimes with their other actions
15:45:29 <Zounds> I've always thought a distrust of government is a pretty healthy thing to have
15:45:50 <Zounds> And a lot of the arguments for gun ownership come from that angle
15:46:06 <Zounds> The government doesn't want you to have guns
15:46:15 <Zounds> so they send their guys with guns to make sure you don't have guns

15:52:25 <Zounds> for hunting and clay pigeon shooting
15:52:41 <DuB_phone> It's just wrong and depressing that "what would I do RIGHT NOW if someone over there started shooting" is an actual thought that goes through my head sometimes 
15:53:02 <DuB_phone> Sick of it

20:11:22 <Camail> do full combo
20:11:26 <Dot`_> i mean.. i cna do them when the bot stands still and i have a few tries
20:11:48 <Camail> also maybe there are better combos than the ones they suggest

20:13:22 <Dot`_> angel!
20:13:36 <Runbunny> Hai.
20:14:24 <Camail> roon are you getting pony fighter as well
20:14:46 <Runbunny> I was considering it.
20:15:16 <Camail> you can play with dot and phear and not get your ass blasted
20:15:29 <Camail> maybe even blast others' asses
20:15:38 <Phearlock> Dot can always fight bad ppl like me to practice on. I don't stand still but am terrible at recovering
20:16:55 <Camail> a big thing with your character phear is that your air dashes are good, but have the critical flaw of being hittable, air blocking is a thing in this game but when you're airdashing you can't do it
20:17:06 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
20:17:11 <Camail> air blocking is HUGE as a neutral game concept because it means you can move forward while also blocking
20:17:32 <Camail> you get more air control but you sacrifice safety for it, so you cant just freely dash whenever you want
20:17:46 <Camail> especially because it's so easy to convert anti-air attacks into a full combo in this game
20:18:54 <Camail> I played a guy in a lobby who was desperately trying to dash in and i just kept on throwing out air normals, catching him, then picking up the combo once i fell back to the ground
20:19:27 <Camail> still dont know who dot is playing
20:20:07 <Bio> devil book horse
20:20:12 <Camail> also, super jumps are a thing
20:20:18 <Dot`_> who else bio
20:20:29 <Camail> you said briefly you were unsure
20:20:30 <Dot`_> until i know enough to really make an informed decision
20:20:41 <Camail> meh, new players like zoners
20:20:50 <Camail> it means you dont have to play footsies which is hard to learn
20:21:16 <Camail> the most important thing you'll learn about her is when to store fireballs and when to use them
20:21:33 <Camail> I'm actually very experienced in that because I main a character with that mechanic
20:21:51 <Camail> it's hard to explain the correct moments, tho
20:23:17 <Camail> I think my main role is just gonna be as a font of knowledge
20:24:38 <Camail> learning how to hop is probably important for most characters, honestly i need to try them...i literally went in, picked paprika, and started grinding tech
20:24:48 <Camail> ?abigail
20:25:43 <Camail> that's still like top 5 tlp moments for me
20:26:04 <Phearlock> lol
20:26:11 <Dot`_> haha
20:26:29 <Bio> lel
20:26:31 <Runbunny> Hmmmmmmmmm.
20:26:43 <Runbunny> I am not really a fan of early access games.
20:27:15 <Camail> the characters are all there
20:27:20 <Phearlock> Awesome, you can be the antagonist
20:27:22 <Camail> its basically where sf5 was at release
20:27:24 <Phearlock> who shuns us
20:28:01 <Camail> there's just a lot of missing comfort components, the game is waaaay more complete than a vast majority of ea games
20:28:14 <Camail> idc if you buy it or not i just want to make sure its for a good reason
20:28:35 <Runbunny> Nah you want me to buy it and I want to as well.
20:28:46 <Camail> well dot wants you to buy it
20:28:56 <Camail> i want to grow the beginners tlp fgc 
20:29:53 <Camail> the pixel lobbies are neat, i dont think there is a button to leave them
20:30:06 <Camail> i pressed all the buttons and couldn't escape, maybe you have to walk to the exit
20:30:15 <Phearlock> Yeah I just quit the game too lol
20:30:15 <Camail> which is... why it's in early access
20:30:16 <Dot`_> you are stuck there forever
20:30:24 <Camail> like, THIS is what ea games should look like
20:30:27 <Phearlock> My current greatest antagonist is not jumping soon enough after the second launcher.
20:30:40 <Phearlock> Fucking can't get up there fast enough half the time =D
20:30:44 <Phearlock> Just execution though
20:31:03 <Camail> jumps are buffered after lunchers, so you dont need to be perfectly timed
20:31:15 <Camail> you can press jump before the jump needs to come out, and it will
20:31:21 <Camail> launchers*
20:31:26 <Camail> I'm sure you can jump after lunch too
20:31:57 <Phearlock> Not if the opponent is fast enoguh at mashing out.
20:32:32 <Phearlock> Eh I just gotta do it more
20:32:38 <Phearlock> It's not THAT hard I just suck =P
20:32:42 <Camail> then you just arent hitting the air normal fast enough after the jump
20:32:54 <Camail> its mostly figuring out what part of your hand is messing up
20:33:14 <Runbunny> All the parts of my hands are messing up.
20:33:31 <Camail> it probably took me like 1100+ tries to be able to consistently pull of paprika's full combo
20:33:52 <Camail> also run they have trial combos but also tell you how many times you've failed and which part you failed at
20:34:18 <Phearlock> I often reset the training to try forget how big the number has gotten.
20:34:24 <Phearlock> =D
20:34:26 <Camail> haha
20:36:30 <Camail> I have like 2.5k hours playing fighting games, i purposely kept the number so that it makes you guys feel better
20:36:45 <Camail> if it takes you twice as long that's still great progress
20:37:31 <Phearlock> Yeah there is progress
20:39:59 <Camail> if they add steam integration for lobby invites that'd be great
20:40:11 <Phearlock> I think they have?
20:41:00 <Phearlock> Not built into the UI but from the steam overlay it should work
20:41:53 <Runbunny> I guess I'll buy it
20:42:00 <Runbunny> Since it's on sale atm anyways.
20:42:18 <Runbunny> You convinced me Camail.
20:50:56 <Runbunny> Which animal do I want to play as?
20:51:06 <Runbunny> I need inspiration.
20:52:32 <Phearlock> which is your favorite pony?
20:54:07 <Camail> yea
20:54:09 <Camail> there is a 1 to 1
20:54:24 <Runbunny> There's a dragon though.
20:54:31 <Runbunny> I am thinking the deer maybe.
20:54:31 <Camail> thats rainbowdash
20:54:35 <Camail> deer is rarity
20:54:45 <Runbunny> Probably that guy.
20:54:52 <Camail> deer is a cool zoner
20:55:07 <Phearlock> Arizona: Has a lasso, johns a lot. Oleander: Cute edge horse, has a book, teleports. Pom: Plays with doggos. Velvet: Obsessive narcissist, very cute. Paprika: Wants to share her floof with everyone and is adorable. Tianhuo: cool dragon that does aircombos and shit, most boring voice lines.
20:55:11 <Camail> like a true zoner with long normals and meh offense
20:55:33 <Phearlock> This is all my most relevant info
20:55:42 <Camail> paprika has a restand which i was not aware of, which i am happy about
20:55:46 <Camail> its a kiss
20:55:54 <Runbunny> Dang.
20:55:59 <Camail> its an anti air but not gonna lie, the fact that it restands is way more important
20:56:18 <Camail> pom is fluttershy, she's kinda  apuppet character
20:56:31 <Camail> like clover, or ms fortune in SG ( not a stance tho)
20:57:21 <Camail> oleander is twilight, kinda like a juri storage mechanic but the fireballs seem more zoning because they move very fast
20:57:49 <Phearlock> She also has ground traps
20:58:05 <Phearlock> that start as really slow short range projectiles
20:58:48 <Camail> velvet is the coolest looking, i like ice
20:59:04 <Camail> she has mid screen overhead and lows, which i think might be insane
20:59:38 <Camail> dont think its as good as i feel it is because air blocking and dash jumping are things
21:01:09 <Runbunny> The snowball literally comes out of her ass.
21:02:07 <Phearlock> hihi yes
21:09:57 <Camail> oh boy I'm scheming
21:10:19 <Camail> I've found an item set up and know where to look for restand set ups
21:10:32 <Camail> this character is gonna get dirty on the ground
21:11:51 <Camail> i was worried about offensive pressure, maybe i dont need to
21:13:03 <Rawr|Phone> I have 20 minutes before I have to go to bed
21:13:12 <Rawr|Phone> I'll buy the game and install it
21:13:27 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
21:20:19 <Runbunny> Game is pretty hard though, however there is a slight chance that I just suck at video games.
21:23:26 <Camail> tfh is medium game
21:24:20 <Dot`_> rawr rawr rawr
21:24:25 <Camail> it honestly feels like kof13 more than anything, but the technical skills are much more lenient
21:24:26 <Runbunny> aka super hard.
21:24:36 <Camail> i mean i guess so
21:24:41 <Camail> my perspective is skewed
21:25:02 <Rawr|Phone> Dot dot dot
21:34:17 <Dot`_> i guess i should practice herd fighting some more now
21:34:37 <Runbunny> Rawr Rawr Rawr.

21:35:13 <Dot`_> cris pon
21:37:26 <Crisium> lo
21:37:47 <Camail> finding set ups is so much harder in this game cuz 99% of the moves end with the other person getting a tech
21:38:03 <Camail> but I'll be damned if i let my opponent play the game
21:38:12 <Dot`_> haha
21:38:29 <Camail> in SG, its like a candy shop
21:38:33 <Camail> reset after reset
21:38:36 <Camail> it was awful
21:38:52 <Camail> fun to win, painful to lose
21:39:39 <Camail> i could fake a fast fall into low and instead do a cross up, that shit was nuts
21:39:50 <Camail> there is a handful of tech that died with me when i left
21:40:06 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
21:49:16 <Camail> oh shit do no all the characters have super jumps?
21:49:37 <Camail> that's fascinating
21:49:42 <Dot`_> like double jump?
21:49:43 <Camail>  oleander doesnt even have a hop
21:49:56 <Camail> no super jumps are just really big jumps
21:50:06 <Phearlock> Oleander has no super jump but has a double jump
21:50:08 <Camail> she has a double jump, but no short hop or super jump
21:50:12 <Camail> weird
21:50:17 <Phearlock> mhm
21:50:23 <Camail> didnt realize they werent universal
21:50:28 <Camail> that changes some thing
21:50:55 <Camail> also, being able to make and save/load your own combos is fucking sick
21:51:02 <Camail> like god damn that's a really cool feature
21:51:33 <Rawr|Phone> I installed the game and I did the trials for paprika
21:51:40 <Rawr|Phone> Seems like a fun game
21:52:11 <Rawr|Phone> Seems like there is not really a lot of damage 
21:52:15 <Rawr|Phone> Time for bed
21:52:23 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
21:52:24 <Dot`_> gnight rawr
21:55:26 <Camail> full combos do 1600 out of ~5000 life
21:55:51 <Camail> like i said before, new players will have a hard time doing a lot of damage per hit
21:59:14 <Camail> seems like the hp totals are 4800,5100, and 4350
21:59:21 <Bio> almost time to maybe perhaps be on the way to getting ajerb
22:00:50 <Dot`_> gl bio
22:03:37 <Dot`> cam, i find a really odd delay between jump -> medium air into light
22:03:46 <Dot`> that time to land keeps getitng me
22:04:04 <Camail> which combo?
22:04:08 <Dot`> maybe it smy keyboard
22:04:31 <Dot`> oleander intermediate 1 has it
22:04:44 <Dot`> ive seen it ina few of the combos
22:04:58 <Dot`> and it always gets me
22:05:07 <Camail> does that on do b,c,jump,c,2c?
22:05:15 <Camail> I'm using abc instead of lmh for this game
22:05:18 <Camail> cuz they use that notaiton
22:05:41 <Dot`> i moved to 456 on numpad as i tihnk thats what you said i should do
22:05:51 <Phearlock> It's weird yeah, I remember that combo, not sure myself on the exact timing.
22:06:16 <Phearlock> jump b-air land abc
22:06:22 <Dot`> jump fprward, jump b, stand a
22:06:29 <Dot`> then yea, bc
22:07:46 <Camail> oh, that
22:07:46 <Dot`> if your doing abc it seems like there is a light buffer time where you need to click
22:07:49 <Camail> git gud, i guess
22:07:49 <Dot`> but when waitign to land
22:07:58 <Dot`> it doesnt have it
22:08:22 <Camail> the window to press A is pretty lenient
22:08:25 <Phearlock> My main issue with the oleander combo trials was qcf-a followed by qcb-b. Really hard on the fingers to get it down as fast as they want.
22:08:41 <Dot`> was just curious is i had something fundemental wrong or was just my bad timing
22:08:46 <Camail> nah just timing
22:08:54 <Camail> thats simple enough, just a mechanical thing
22:09:18 <Camail> try pressing the air B a bit later
22:09:22 <Camail> so you aren't waiting to land as long
22:09:36 <Camail> also crouching opponents will cause an early air B to whiff
22:10:33 <Camail> there aren't many landing frames, but i think you are lumping all of the frames after the hit as "landing frames"
22:10:49 <Camail> you reduce that by hitting the button later
22:10:58 <Camail> because there are like, almost 0 recovery frames for landing
22:11:10 <Camail> i'd guess like 3 at most
22:17:16 <Dot`> if you tap down a lot with deer you get a voiceline
22:17:20 <Dot`> not with anyone else
22:33:54 <Dot`> where is that dub
22:37:29 <Dot`> apparently oleander can pick ppl up in the book and throw them
22:37:41 <Dot`> learning stuff by idly mashing keys between combos
22:38:25 <Phearlock> Yeah all chars have a throw
22:38:30 <Phearlock> she throws people pretty far though

22:49:49 <Phearlock> hi dubbers
22:49:59 <Dot`> you got your mouse?
22:50:00 <DuB`> MOUSE
22:50:03 <DuB`> Ye
22:50:05 <Dot`> MOUSE
22:50:11 <Phearlock> yay
22:50:34 <DuB`> Gonna take a bit to get used to the taller back, but it's not too big

22:58:21 <Camail> Dot`  yea throw is BC
22:58:32 <Camail> paprika gets a combo off hers
22:59:19 <Runbunny> Isn't it just 2 atk buttons?
23:00:09 <Camail> yea, there are three attacks, a,b, and c
23:00:16 <Camail> b+c is throw
23:00:36 <Camail> oleander's throw just forces them full screen
23:00:45 <Camail> but some characters can convert it into a combo
23:01:20 <Dot`> cows throw is weird
23:01:41 <Camail> i am pretty sure it combos
23:01:47 <Camail> but yea its kinda weird
