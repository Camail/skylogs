00:04:35 <Dot> sounds nice
00:04:42 <DuB`> Yeah!
00:05:02 <DuB`> All the rest of this week should be super chill
00:05:04 <DuB`> I'mma enjoy it
00:05:18 <Dot> we should fight hooves again sometime
00:05:56 <DuB`> Oke
00:08:01 <Crisium> yee
00:08:03 <Crisium> hoove slap
00:08:27 <Camail> like now
00:08:32 <Dot> no
00:08:34 <Dot> i tired
00:08:37 <Dot> and work tomorww
00:09:13 <Camail> subnautica is so goooood
00:09:31 <Camail> its like the opposite of shadow of war
00:09:37 <Dot> haha
00:09:48 <Dot> i plan to get it when it goes on special
00:10:00 <DuB`> Yeah, looks nice
00:10:10 <DuB`> Ocean and nature and science and EXPLORE
00:10:32 <DuB`> I watched all of Blue Planet just last month :P
00:10:45 <Dot> its good stuff
00:11:28 <Camail> deep rock galactic looks really cool
00:11:39 <DuB`> Is that the space dorf one
00:11:41 <Dot> thats the dorf game?
00:11:42 <DuB`> Yeah
00:11:43 <Camail> $25 is a bit much for an early access coop game but i look forward to it
00:11:43 <DuB`> Hehe
00:12:08 <Dot> i was suprised to see Vermintide 2 at only 22 pounds
00:12:17 <Camail> yea its cheaper than i thought it would be
00:12:32 <Phearlock> Saw some footage, not super interested yet but if it ends up being good I'll certainly try space dorfs
00:12:34 <Camail> probably re-used the engine they used before
00:12:38 <Dot> its going to be 90% dlc by the end
00:12:51 <Dot> vermintide
00:13:03 <Camail> galactic looks interesting mostly because of how distinct the classes are
00:13:19 <Camail> the gameplay loop is pretty simple
00:14:07 <Dot> skram, we should play vermintide again sometime too
00:16:37 <Bio> GG
00:16:43 <Micen|Droid> We messed up on rules dot

00:17:07 <Micen|Droid> I forgot how my spells work
00:17:38 <Micen|Droid> I give command and on targets next turn they do command. So I should have got swings in. Oh well. Was still fun
