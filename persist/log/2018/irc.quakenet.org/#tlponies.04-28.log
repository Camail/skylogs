02:11:34 <Phearlock> Of course the first heavy mech I salvage is the Dragon. It's like it's symbolic or some shit.
02:12:12 <Phearlock> Honestly, not that scary of a heavy, it's more of an uparmored medium or a really lightly armed heavy. But it's speedy.
02:12:33 <Phearlock> I can punch things with it. should be good

17:44:24 <Zounds> what do you think of the potential symm changes Crisium 
17:49:18 <Crisium> sounds OP
17:49:25 <Crisium> depends on range of primary fire
17:49:41 <Crisium> but her secondary is basically pharah shot, so good for shield spam, long distance corner abuse
17:49:56 <Zounds> yeah
17:49:59 <Crisium> but that primary, 195 damage is nuts especially if its FREE on barrers
17:50:01 <Zounds> I do like the sound of the ultimate 
17:50:12 <Zounds> I can imagine many scenarios it would be useful
17:50:13 <Crisium> giant shield along whole map lol
17:50:19 <DuB`> Reworked teleporter on E is a good idea - ANYTHING to make her actually interactive
17:50:20 <Crisium> divide the point in 2cp
17:50:37 <Crisium> best part of that new E is that its a ferry.  you can get anyone to the high ground
17:50:45 <Crisium> i think it will deploy like you deploy reapers E
