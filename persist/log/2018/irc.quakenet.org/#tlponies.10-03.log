21:16:22 <skram> DuB` i need you to show me
21:17:57 <Camail> dub cobblestone is no longer in the active map pool so you will never have that awful experience again
21:18:04 <Camail> unless you play nuke
21:18:07 <Camail> or overpass
21:18:27 <Camail> and train
21:42:27 <Zounds> looks like a tracer figure at first skram
21:45:33 <DuB`> Good oberwajes
21:45:42 <DuB`> But now that it has ended I have to do exam study! D:
22:00:37 <Runbunny> Nuke is great.
22:01:20 <Camail> not when you have 0 call outs
22:02:21 <Runbunny> I have like 68% win rate on Nuke.
22:07:05 <Camail> run i've began ranking back up from all the decay

22:29:27 <Camail> an interesting thing i've noticed is that i can never be turned on with both rifle and awp in the same game, numerous time's i've been hot on rifles and thought to push my confidence by going aggressive with an awp, then i just get fucked
