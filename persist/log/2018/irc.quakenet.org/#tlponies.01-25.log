00:00:09 <carcinisation> maybe we will finally see symmetra in owl?
00:00:19 <Bio> nej
00:00:43 <carcinisation> give nanowave D:
00:01:48 <Bio> The production value from OWL is very nice
00:02:01 <DuB`> I can't watch
00:02:05 <DuB`> This game is going to be brutal
00:02:13 <Dot`> link
00:03:57 <DuB`> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_disasters
00:04:08 <DuB`> ( https://www.twitch.tv/overwatchleague )
00:04:37 <DuB`> Hopefully shock can not lose instantly to excel
00:05:22 <Dot`> they dont look korean
00:05:44 <Dot`> they do
00:06:21 <Dot`> so i still dont understnad, why are they not Seoul spitfire?
00:07:05 <DuB`> wuh
00:07:37 <Dot`> why london
00:07:44 <Dot`> they are not british
00:08:51 <DuB`> Manchester United has no players from Manchester
00:09:00 <Dot`> so why are they named that
00:09:10 <Dot`> this whole tournment confuses me
00:09:33 <Dot`> are the new york team from new york?
00:09:42 <DuB`> Because being called SpainItalyEnglandBelgiumIvoryCoast Utd would be silly?
00:09:50 <CockRoach|42> probably from new jersey
00:10:16 <Dot`> but Dub, why not Team Spitfire
00:10:29 <Dot`> thast how most sports do it
00:11:02 <Dot`> is it an american thing?
00:11:11 <DuB`> Wat
00:12:13 <Dot`> they all just seem to have come with a team name and then been randomly given a city name to place in front of it
00:12:38 <DuB`> The orgs are based in those cities, and can sign any player
00:12:45 <DuB`> Just like every sport ever
00:12:59 <DuB`> The team names have some relation to those places
00:13:20 <Phearlock_> Blizz wanted to make their esperts more like regularsperts
00:13:33 <Phearlock_> Hence why the team names work more like regularsperts team names.
00:13:59 <Phearlock_> Instead of just main sponsor or somesuch.
00:14:52 <Dot`> i cant think of any sport in south africa that attaches city names as a primary tihng
00:14:57 <Dot`> it just seemed so random to me
00:15:59 <DuB`> Well perhaps that's a SA thing. :P
00:16:08 <Dot`> well how would i know
00:16:21 <Dot`> ive asked you about the city name things three times and you havnt explained it
00:16:24 <Dot`> just said Wuh
00:16:35 <Phearlock_> I mean most teams in norway don't have place names in their team names.
00:16:46 <DuB`> Man U, Inter Milan, Real Madrid
00:16:55 <Phearlock_> But people do know where they're based and people mainly cheer for the team of their city/town/area.
00:16:59 <Dot`> i dont know any of those dub
00:17:06 <DuB`> Are you even real
00:17:07 <Phearlock_> But then these have been established for a long time
00:17:45 <Phearlock_> It's like, dot, in regularsportses. People often do support their "home team"
00:18:02 <Phearlock_> It's an easy identifier for figuring out who "your guys" are
00:18:09 <Phearlock_> even if none of them come from your place.
00:18:22 <Phearlock_> and esports typically does not have this.
00:18:31 <Phearlock_> Apart from sometimes stuff like West vs East in doto
00:18:36 <Phearlock_> or U S A chants etc
00:19:01 <Phearlock_> now blizzard wants to cash in on this regularsports thing to help make their esperts more accessible
00:19:02 <Dot`> <Phearlock_> It's like, dot, in regularsportses. People often do support their "home team"
00:19:06 <Phearlock_> By making it more relatable
00:19:20 <Dot`> yea, they just normaly dont have *city name* in SA
00:19:26 <Phearlock_> Yeah
00:19:51 <Phearlock_> It's typical in america and in UK football though
00:20:02 <Bio> yarp
00:20:03 <Dot`> so i asked why all the teams had seemingly random city names 
00:20:07 <Phearlock_> Which is I think the audience they're mostly trying to attract.
00:20:09 <Dot`> everytime dub has linked this stream
00:20:44 <Dot`> but apparently its one of those things people take for granted knowing
00:20:49 <Phearlock_> Did my explainaition help?
00:20:53 <Dot`> yes
00:20:57 <Phearlock_> Sweet.

22:29:36 <DuB`> Two more chances for a first-ever match win against a korean roster today.
22:30:04 <Bio> spoiler
22:30:08 <Bio> it doesn't
22:30:11 <Bio> happen
22:30:12 <skram> who's the korean team
22:30:16 <skram> i dont know any of these teams
22:30:21 <skram> or any of these players really
22:30:21 <DuB`> Londer and NY are korean rosters
22:30:59 <skram> Why are they called london if they're koreans
22:31:10 <skram> why not busan buttfuckers or whatever
22:31:27 <Crisium> rude
22:31:34 <skram> well a little bit
22:31:34 <Dot`> i hear its a normal sports thing skram
22:31:40 <skram> isnt there a team called seoul whatevers
22:31:45 <DuB`> Yes.
22:32:17 <Crisium> go boston go
22:32:20 <skram> im not a fan of the city noun scheme
22:32:33 <skram> especially if said city has nothing to do with anything
22:32:47 <Dot`> me neither skram
22:33:10 <Crisium> you prefer corporate overlords?
22:33:12 <DuB`> In future seasons the cities will have their own stages/etc and will travel.
22:33:15 <Crisium> Samsung Spitfire
22:33:22 <Dot`> but i was informed its where they are based(?) and then they can sign on whoever they want
22:33:36 <skram> what no
22:33:55 <Dot`> i would prefer Team Spitfire as a name
22:34:02 <Dot`> over London Spitfire
22:34:06 <skram> like attached to an actual team like in every other esports ever
22:34:14 <skram> london spitfire isnt so bad actually
22:34:39 <skram> proper references and everything
22:34:43 <skram> then again so is boston uprising
22:34:44 <skram> sort of
22:34:47 <DuB`> That's the whole point though, it's supposed to be a step away from the esports norm and it's why/how they have so many big investors/sponsors.
22:35:14 <skram> nah i get it
22:35:33 <skram> i dont know if its a good thing to step away from brands with actual clout though
22:35:36 <skram> guess we'll see
22:35:57 <DuB`> I just like boston because it's the HuKteam
22:36:11 <DuB`> RIP this game tho
