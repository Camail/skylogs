18:00:37 <Zounds> And the healing orb does so much
18:00:41 <carcinisation> spoiler: we completely rolled them xD
18:00:51 <skram> Yeah I think healing orb is the best part of her kit
18:00:56 <skram> except ult
18:01:01 <carcinisation> much heals many ults wow
18:01:18 <Zounds> I like how the orb heals you even during shadowstep
18:01:51 <Zounds> Adds some survivability
18:02:06 <Zounds> I do find ulting moiras real easy to headshot if they're anywhere near me as McCree
18:02:10 <carcinisation> i gotta remember to orb before ulting tho
18:02:20 <Zounds> Though she's usually at the back out of effective range
18:02:35 <Zounds> Gotta double tap her or she just heals back up
18:03:06 <carcinisation> well if you 1v1 a moira (or sym) you can just stand still for aim
18:03:51 <Zounds> I'm one of those guys who uses my movement keys while aiming
18:04:00 <Zounds> So I'd probably be just as accurate standing still as I am moving

22:36:40 <CockRoach|42> awww
22:38:15 <Phearlock> Awwww she's so floofy
22:45:52 <skram> aaw jeez
22:46:11 <Bio> nej horsesensneses
22:46:19 <skram> so I installed some mods and whatnot to make dragon age origins not look like butt when i replayed it
22:47:33 <skram> my dwarfs arms are regular human sized and reaches down to the kneecaps
22:57:42 <Camail_> thats how arms work
22:57:56 <Camail> i never thought of playing dao modded
22:58:22 <Camail> also i never finished da:i and i dont think i ever will
22:58:27 <skram> There's some content that can be modded back in
22:58:48 <skram> which has to do with morrigan but i dont know what
22:58:56 <Camail> ehhhhh, modding in unfinished stuff has never appealed to me
22:59:09 <skram> it is finished
22:59:14 <skram> voice lines and everything
22:59:46 <Camail> that doesnt really mean finished, if they cut it there was something wrong
23:00:03 <skram> true enough
23:00:04 <Camail> and if the devs know somethings bad before even releasing the content I dont have much faith
23:00:05 <skram> dont know what
23:01:16 <Camail> certainly a very fun game tho

23:01:53 <skram> Found a mod to skip the entire fucking fade thing
23:02:00 <skram> which is gonne improve it by a lot
23:02:31 <Camail> i assume it automatically gives you the stat buffs tho
23:02:36 <skram> yup
23:03:04 <Camail> fade was really fun the first time, not super replayable
23:03:18 <Camail> i like that world so much but i dont trust that company with dragon age anymore
23:04:16 <skram> bioware is putting all their effort into a new IP
23:04:29 <skram> which apparently is why ME:A was... unpolished
23:04:53 <skram> open world rpg with coop
23:04:57 <skram> i have no faith in it
23:05:05 <Phearlock> It was also just delayed lol
23:05:11 <Phearlock> (though this is fine)
23:06:23 <skram> sigh
23:06:30 <skram> maybe da4 is acceptable
23:06:56 <skram> its where you fight a literal god
23:07:03 <skram> like you havent already killed like 3 of them
23:12:16 <Bio> never again
