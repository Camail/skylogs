16:26:06 <DuB`> I played like 7 hours of ps2 yesterday :P
16:26:12 <Zounds> :o
16:26:21 <Zounds> neat
16:26:32 <Zounds> there's a patch today
16:27:13 <skrm> mostly theory zounds, like 2 hours of lifting forks in a 4 day course
16:29:12 <Zounds> theory is important but I'd guess 2 hours practical is not enough to be comfortable :p
16:32:02 <Dot> hey dubs
16:32:32 <skrm> Eh not really but i've logged enough hours at work so its ok :p

17:02:51 <DuB`> I play now, but yes :)
17:09:04 <DuB`> Zounds, do you know how your ping to USEast is in ps2?
17:10:01 <DuB`> I get 65, 80, 150 to US West, East, and EU and wonder which would be best for playing with EU bois
17:11:01 <Zounds> probably about 100 or so
17:11:09 <Zounds> tbh I was playing on EU west with camail and it was fine
17:11:16 <Zounds> I was a laglord but its not unplayable
17:12:24 <DuB`> oke oke
17:13:13 <DuB`> Steelseries QCK+ pad was on sale for $10 so I picked up a fresh one
17:13:16 <DuB`> Feels nice :D

17:19:43 <Runbunny> Ps2 servers were down when I wanted to play earlier :/
17:19:51 <Zounds> yes patch today
17:19:57 <Zounds> new alerts
17:20:05 <Zounds> mini alerts
17:20:13 <Zounds> plus they brought back the old (and much better) main alert
17:20:22 <Zounds> now whoever has most % at end of alert wins
17:20:25 <Zounds> not this 2v1 horseshit
17:21:04 <Zounds> which was fine in theory but thanks to a braindead playerbase didn't work out
17:22:04 <Runbunny> DuB`, Zounds just called us braindead.
17:22:30 <Zounds> I was thinking more the NC boys who zerg the VS when it's a TR alert
17:22:44 <Zounds> Or whatever configuration of factions
17:23:03 <Runbunny> They really don't like spandex those NC boys.
17:23:37 <Zounds> I mained NC for years
17:23:40 <Zounds> I can verify that
17:25:26 <Zounds> there's some special guys on NC
