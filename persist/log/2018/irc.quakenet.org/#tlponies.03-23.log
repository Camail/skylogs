01:49:23 <DuB`> Oh yeah, about WF
01:50:14 <DuB`> It's fine as a group game for an hour or two when you have a specific goal or direction, but the levelling grind part is less so
01:51:48 <Camail> what if we still your credit card and buy all the stuff
01:51:55 <Camail> does that skip the grinding
01:52:13 <DuB`> Um

01:52:18 <Camail> steal*
01:52:22 <Camail> good enough for me
01:52:35 <DuB`> Unless you really don't want to play the game and ACTUALLY buy everything 
01:53:20 <Camail> i think the only grind game i'm actually interested in is monster hunter
01:53:43 <Crisium> true grind game is skill based
