00:11:29 <Dot`> and i I NEED PICS
00:11:34 <skram> And you know that I dont like dogs but its the most adorable fucking thing
00:11:43 <DuB`> :D
00:12:14 <Bio> we had fruit pizza for dessert today
00:12:20 <Bio> yummi
00:14:07 <Dot`> and skram, when is one shot
00:14:17 <DuB`> LAG so crazy
00:14:18 <Crisium> this gla rollout
00:14:19 <Crisium> wow
00:14:27 <DuB`> Most creative team right now for sure.
00:17:41 <DuB`> Probably goof for LAG that florida benched logix for some reason...
00:18:10 <Crisium> this doomfist
00:18:17 <DuB`> Hydration is THE doom
00:18:26 <Bio> DOOM
00:18:31 <Dot`> AAAAHHHHHHH SKRAM
00:18:34 <DuB`> I don't think anyone has even 1/3rd as much doom playtime as him
00:18:35 <Dot`> its amazing!
00:18:39 <skram> :D
00:19:09 <skram> is just a lil wrinkle
00:22:14 <DuB`> ??
00:24:01 <skram> which team are you cheering on doob
00:24:03 <Dot`> its so adorable!
00:24:11 <DuB`> Gladiators
00:24:42 <skram> chek ur discords dub
00:26:20 <DuB`> perfec
00:27:53 <DuB`> Does infrasight show riptire through walls?
00:27:55 <DuB`> No right?
00:28:20 <skram> hmm
00:28:23 <Crisium> it might, i dunno.  riptire usually counts as a person
00:28:23 <skram> dont think so no
00:28:56 <DuB`> Phew
00:29:08 <DuB`> Oke, down to decider game.
00:30:05 <DuB`> Despite "infra" referring to emitting heat, not all things that would emit heat show from her ultimate, such as Riptire. Ironically, Widowmaker, whom is cold-blooded, still appears during Infra-Sight.

00:30:54 <Dot`> skram, have you higgred the dog?
00:31:19 <Dot`> hugged*
00:32:29 <Camail> cold blooded things still emit black body radiation, which is what we detect
00:32:34 <Camail> its just a lower energy
00:33:12 <skram> I have not met it in person yet Dot`
00:33:16 <skram> i dont know if i will
00:33:21 <Dot`> unacceptable
00:36:25 <DuB`> SHURFUR

00:37:41 <Bio> sorefour literally widowmaker
00:37:44 <Bio> no emotion
00:41:00 <Bio> I don't get why people do that spray during a fight 
00:41:07 <Crisium> i do it too
00:41:07 <Bio> theres like 0 benefit to it
00:41:13 <Crisium> theres no downside
00:41:16 <Crisium> you do it during reloa
00:41:19 <Crisium> reload*
00:41:36 <Bio> i mean i guess
00:42:04 <DuB`> Gotta pad your APM stats! :P
00:42:14 <Crisium> i spray everywhere Bio
00:42:16 <Crisium> all over
00:42:38 <skram> its way fucking cool though bio
00:43:21 <Bio> i already can't aim skrm
00:43:36 <Bio> don't need to move my cursor even further away from the enemies!
00:43:41 <skram> who can
00:43:44 <Crisium> aim isnt needed in OW
00:43:56 <Dot`> Runbunny: https://imgur.com/gallery/jrw5TNB
00:44:01 <Crisium> you can play Winston, Mercy, Rein only and make GM
00:44:40 <Crisium> of course if you pick most of the cast, yes aiming is critical
00:44:47 <Runbunny> What a ferret!
00:44:53 <DuB`> Splatoon > OW, gotta paint everything
00:44:58 <Crisium> i play both
00:45:04 <Crisium> git on my level
00:45:12 <Crisium> spray and paint everything
00:45:14 <Crisium> all over

01:10:31 <DuB`> Ehhh
01:10:34 <DuB`> Not tonite I thinks
01:17:17 <Crisium> stage playoffs are only 1-3 spots before final playoffs right
