00:00:08 <DuB`> Only if my FACE IS A TRASH CAN
00:00:50 <Zounds> I think I'll skip the WoW stream
00:01:10 <Zounds> It's a game you gotta play, not watch :P
00:01:26 <skram> btw zaunds did you level a horde fella yet
00:02:03 <Bio> watch my stream for all the best horde aktion
00:02:08 <skram> the quest density has to be a lot higher in kul tiras or something because im like 114 and a half and im almost finished with a single zone
00:02:18 <skram> as a horde lad i finished all the zones before getting 120
00:02:19 <Zounds> Horde doing WQs is the same as Alliance doing WQs Bio 
00:02:26 <Zounds> Not that entertaining
00:02:40 <Zounds> Yeah I was 120 before I hit the 3rd zone
00:04:58 <Zounds> Only did the intro on my hunter
00:05:23 <Zounds> cringed a bit at thalyssra and larn skyhorn making quips while killing alliance
00:05:30 <Zounds> and left the character in the dumpster
00:06:12 <Zounds> Sorry for leading the rebellion to save your city Thalyssra
00:06:15 <skram> yeah...
00:06:22 <Zounds> Sorry for saving your villiage and uniting your tribes larn
00:06:25 <Zounds> twats
00:06:33 <skram> at least jaina made a glorious return home
00:06:49 <Zounds> Yeah, her buff was pretty funny during the horde scenario
00:07:22 <skram> gotta say it was pretty neat doing quests in freehold without being in the instance though
00:07:42 <Zounds> "Ashes of Theramore" "Jaina has not forgotten the crimes commited by the horde against her people"
00:08:00 <skram> god dang terrorists
00:08:23 <Bio> pls
00:08:31 <Bio> i'm doing island expeditons
00:08:35 <Bio> with JAZZ
00:09:19 <Bio> also obligatory fuk jaina
00:09:29 <Zounds> She's gonna fuk u bio
00:09:51 <Bio> either way, right?
00:09:57 <Zounds> The Jaina storyline for Alliance is really cool
00:10:33 <Zounds> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1gCxPe5G9g
00:10:37 <Zounds> spoilers obviously
00:19:08 <skram> ive not finished the story yet D:
00:20:41 <DuB`> skram du u even wow
00:20:56 <DoT`> no passion
00:21:21 <DoT`> Dub, you want to West Marches DnD friday?
00:21:26 <skram> lad, i've played wow since you were 5
00:22:24 <DoT`> skram is super old
00:22:51 <skram> old enough to be ur dad
00:23:02 <skram> thats why i got all these toto records y'know
00:23:19 <DoT`> its very immpresive, when i am even older than you
00:24:21 <skram> yeah
00:24:26 <skram> thats why DoT` is my father
00:24:46 <DoT`> and your mine? its a bit odd
00:24:49 <skram> with his flatcap and tweed jacket and archaic views
00:25:01 <skram> nono, im dubs dad
00:25:37 <skram> hey pops, we should teach DuB` how to build a DECK.
00:25:46 <DoT`> iI LOVE DECKS
00:26:29 <DoT`> but my back is sore, so maybe tomorow
00:26:54 <DoT`> no need to be in a rush
00:27:01 <skram> course not
00:27:43 <DuB`> :O
00:27:53 <Zounds> I had to heal a dungeon today skram 
00:27:58 <DuB`> I can't put a DECK on my APARTMENT
00:28:02 <Zounds> kings rest
00:28:06 <Zounds> feels like mana is infinite this expac
00:28:09 <Zounds> was real ez
00:28:14 <skram> really?
00:28:14 <DoT`> young man, you can put a deck anywhere
00:28:31 <DuB`> Even in MANHATTAN?
00:28:36 <skram> im having fun doing mythics 'cause its actually challenging sometimes zounds
00:28:38 <skram> i even go oom
00:28:53 <skram> are you disco or holy
00:28:59 <Zounds> hmm well my sample size was very small for healing
00:29:00 <Zounds> I was disc
00:29:15 <Zounds> Shadow most of the time but we had 5 online in the guild and no healer
00:29:28 <skram> ye i dont know how disco works now, but as holy you really only have 2 spells for hard single-target healing
00:29:37 <skram> and they cost all the manas
00:29:44 <Zounds> Disc felt OP
00:30:20 <skram> disc has always been pretty good though
00:30:23 <skram> as far as i can recall
00:30:50 <Zounds> Been good in different ways for a long time
00:31:01 <skram> ya
00:31:10 <Zounds> WotLK shield spam with infinite mana due to rapture
00:31:16 <Zounds> Didn't play disc in cata
00:31:23 <skram> and smiting as actually a worthwhile endeavour now
00:31:46 <Zounds> Towards the end of MoP smiting was OP too
00:32:11 <Zounds> That was before the "offensive healer" thing was fleshed out though
00:32:21 <skram> aye
00:32:23 <Zounds> Atonement just healed the lowest health party member when you did damage
00:32:28 <Zounds> Smart healing was way OP
00:33:05 <Zounds> I found disc great in Legion after knowing the fights a little bit
00:33:21 <Zounds> since you knew when to prep atonements on the raid for incoming damage
00:33:49 <skram> i have not tried disc since wotlk
00:34:03 <skram> and i just played the tail end of legion
00:34:14 <Zounds> It seems complicated but its easy once you get used to it
00:34:57 <skram> Im just trying to figure shadow out
00:35:03 <Zounds> Though I'm aiming to be a dime a dozen damage dealing scumbag this expansion I don't mind dusting off the disc if I have to
00:35:19 <skram> I dont know if shadow got the short end of the stick in this one but i do crap damage
00:35:23 <skram> maybe im missing haste
00:35:41 <Zounds> Our burst AoE is incredible this time around
00:35:47 <Zounds> What talents are you running?
00:36:02 <Zounds> And haste is a big thing yeah
00:36:49 <skram> atm im just doing the ones on the icy veins guide
00:36:59 <skram> fortress/mania/misery/legacy/mindbender
00:37:54 <Zounds> Ah that's the talents for the simplest gameplay
00:38:01 <Zounds> not really optimal for dungeons or raids
00:38:03 <skram> in wotlk you had haste plateaus
00:38:14 <skram> dont think thats a thing now since void eruption messes it all up
00:38:26 <Zounds> https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/shadow-priest-pve-dps-spec-builds-talents
00:38:33 <skram> so basically you'd probably want to stack all the haste just do get everything done quicker
00:38:35 <Zounds> This is the page you want to look at for competitive talent builds
00:38:52 <Zounds> Haste -> faster ticks + more spells = more insanity = more and longer voidforms
00:38:54 <Zounds> haste is god
00:39:05 <skram> aye
00:39:44 <Zounds> I can't recommend the swift navigation weapon enchant enough
00:39:48 <Zounds> it's crazy powerful
00:40:02 <Zounds> +50 haste stacks 5 times, at 5 stacks 600 haste for a short duration
00:40:20 <skram> damn
00:41:36 <Zounds> Shadow Word: Void is really ideal for making the spec more fun to play and a bit less punishing
00:41:38 <Zounds> in the first tier
00:41:39 <Bio> pretty much everyone needs haste atm
00:41:44 <Bio> so little stats T_T
00:42:12 <skram> ya
00:42:24 <skram> and it does 10% more damage than mind blast regardless
00:42:39 <Runbunny> Not dps and tank monk though.
00:42:46 <Runbunny> Haste is like the worst stat.
00:42:56 <Zounds> Yeah, the real trick is it means you don't miss any mind blasts
00:43:08 <skram> also true
00:43:20 <Zounds> Since if you keep it at 0 charges but miss a second or two you'll just have 1 charge + some CD towards 2nd
00:43:46 <skram> yeah its basically a buffer
00:43:49 <Zounds> Shadow crash is great to have something to cast while moving
00:43:52 <Zounds> even single target
00:44:07 <Zounds> gives 20 insanity which is nice to build up to or immediately after a 60 insanity voidform
00:44:24 <skram> yeah it seems interesting
00:44:53 <Zounds> I've been topping dps in most mythic dungeons I've done
00:45:08 <Zounds> beaten out a few times but some ret pala asshat but fuck that guy :P
00:45:29 <Runbunny> Well they completely wrecked affliction warlock AoE this expansion. I get out dps'ed by a priest spamming holy nova.
00:45:40 <skram> as a ret pala im deeply offended zounds
00:45:58 <Zounds> Nothing against ret palas in general
00:46:04 <Zounds> just that guy who does more damage than me sometimes
00:46:10 <skram> maybe they just swapped places with shadow pr√¶st runbunny
00:46:18 <Zounds> Yes it's actually hilarious
00:46:24 <Zounds> Spriest went from the worst at AoE burst
00:46:27 <Zounds> Now we just crush it
00:46:48 <Zounds> It's not exactly on demand since we need insanity to do it but jesus it hits hard
00:47:00 <skram> shadow was mostly useless in fights lasting less than 1 minute in wotlk
00:47:08 <Zounds> And in Legion
00:47:13 <skram> probably
00:47:14 <Runbunny> affliction warlock has crazy single target dps though.
00:47:20 <skram> aye indeed
00:48:14 <Zounds> Legion had our DoTs scale hugely based on void form stacks thanks to the artifact
00:48:15 <Bio> locks are back to being rly gud again
00:48:28 <Zounds> BFA doesn't have that so we're a lot stronger to start off with
00:48:45 <Zounds> but weaker in the longer fights I guess
00:49:28 <skram> i havent seen any mythic shadow lads yet
00:49:46 <skram> in my friend group theres 9 tanks and 9 deeps and i get to be the healer
00:50:02 <skram> ..sometimes i even get to do all the mythics twice!
00:51:01 <Bio> rude bois
00:51:07 <Zounds> Mage is pretty gud this expac
00:51:11 <Zounds> Nothing new there though
00:51:14 <Zounds> Blizzards babby class
00:51:17 <skram> haha
00:51:21 <Bio> can't complaian
00:52:14 <skram> well they removed rolling ignites way back when
00:52:27 <skram> which was proper op
00:52:47 <Zounds> Only one mage got to grow his epeen on the damage meter with that though
00:53:01 <skram> but what an epeen it was
00:53:12 <skram> almost as big as that pala that discovered reckoning stacked 1400 times
00:53:25 <Zounds> ^^ I love that broken stuff
00:55:12 <reification> night all
00:55:18 <Runbunny> Swing cancelling was also a thing apparently
00:55:19 <Zounds> You guys had any bounties on you yet? if you do war mode at all
00:55:23 <Runbunny> Goodnight Reif.
00:55:25 <Zounds> nn reif
00:55:42 <skram> ive not yet pvpd at all
00:55:45 <Zounds> I had a bounty on me for a few hours a couple nights ago
00:55:49 <skram> mind controlled a few lads off some cliffs though
00:56:03 <Zounds> killed a ton of guys with the bounty but still the quest for the title didn't pop
00:56:08 <Zounds> I was a bit miffed
00:56:47 <skram> theres a title too?
00:57:00 <Zounds> It's supposed to be kill 10 guys while you have a bounty on you already
00:57:12 <skram> neat
00:57:15 <Zounds> but I'm not entirely sure what triggers it since I killed maybe 100+ with a bounty on me and didn't get it
00:59:19 <Zounds> The bounty system is a cool idea but it's not really working that well imo
00:59:38 <Zounds> Usually you're on some shard in a group full of guys with bounties slaughtering hapless hordes/alliance
00:59:59 <Zounds> While on another shard phased from you there's a group of guys from the other faction slaughtering hapless alliance/hordes
01:00:03 <Zounds> and you cant meet each other
01:00:58 <skram> stormscale is so heavily overpopulated by horde i think most allies dont turn war mode on
01:01:05 <skram> i rarely meet any honestly
01:01:18 <skram> except the few ones brave enough to use the summoning stone
01:01:58 <Zounds> I'm grouped with all the RP realms since I used to be RP-PvP before the all became RP
01:02:14 <Zounds> It's a decent faction balance overall, but in any particular shard it seems to be all horde or all alliance :P
01:02:27 <skram> of course :p
01:03:18 <Zounds> It's alright though
01:03:33 <Zounds> Any hour / day either faction might have the upper hand
01:03:55 <Zounds> I quite like our realm grouping for that
01:05:08 <Runbunny> It's impossible to do WQ's with war mode on, on my realm.
01:05:47 <skram> thats because you're a gnome
01:05:57 <Runbunny> Since it's like 4 horde to 1 alliance.
01:06:12 <Runbunny> That only means I'm a killer Jonas.
01:07:18 <Zounds> If you're a killer then kill them
01:07:22 <Zounds> 1v4 no problem
