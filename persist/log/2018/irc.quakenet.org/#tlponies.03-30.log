20:32:42 <Rawr|Phone> My dear
20:33:05 <skrm> Henrik
20:33:06 <skrm> Gamle Ã¸rn
20:33:21 <Rawr|Phone> How has your day been
20:33:35 <skrm> Decent so far
20:33:38 <skrm> How a boat you
20:34:52 <Rawr|Phone> Very goooood
20:35:07 <Rawr|Phone> On my way home so I can go to bed
20:39:25 <skrm> so early!
20:39:36 <Zounds> Not that early?
20:40:21 <skrm> zounds its friday
20:41:17 <Zounds> Worth going to bed at a decent time if you wanna make a lot of your saturday!
20:43:39 <Zounds> esp if you're a healthy and wholesome lad like rawr
20:43:52 <Zounds> And not a burnt our cynical sack of shit like the rest of us
20:44:02 <Zounds> burnt out*
20:44:12 <Camail> hey, skram is the most sack-like of all of us
20:44:19 <Camail> we dont all have to be the same kind of container
20:44:29 <Camail> dot is like a lunchbox
20:44:37 <Camail> dub is a handbag
20:44:51 <Zounds> what are you cam
20:44:56 <Zounds> a duffel bag?
20:45:10 <skrm> a gaping maw
20:45:10 <Camail> i dunno if we get to decide our own metaphor
20:45:23 <Zounds> Then I decree you a fanny pack
20:45:47 <Camail> as long as its an 80's-90's fanny pack and not a modern day one
20:45:57 <skrm> wait stop
20:46:15 <skrm> tell me about the differences in fanny pack fashion
20:46:27 <Camail> it WAS fashionable, and cool people wore them
20:46:33 <Camail> now its just shitty people
20:46:48 <Camail> i'd rather be on some hot person, or at least a normal person
20:46:48 <skrm> so the fanny pack hasnt changed, only people
20:46:53 <Camail> yea
20:46:57 <Zounds> We scots have had fanny packs for hundreds of years
20:47:02 <Zounds> Though we call them sporrans
20:47:13 <Zounds> and fanny means vagina here
20:47:14 <skrm> they also wear dresses
20:47:20 <Zounds> so that's always a giggle
20:47:37 <Camail> vaginas are cool, I'm okay with that
20:48:00 <skrm> if a horse had a fanny pack how would it wear it
20:48:12 <Camail> stop with your dog pants meme
20:48:33 <Zounds> I'd put it around the neck so it hangs over the chest
20:49:00 <Zounds> Assuming the horse has no other gear on
20:49:33 <Camail> i mean, we already have saddle bags
20:49:41 <Camail> that seems to be the best position
20:50:06 <Zounds> That was part of the other gear I was thinking about
20:50:12 <Zounds> Cuz yeah...saddle bags
20:50:19 <Zounds> needs a saddle
20:50:26 <skrm> yeah but they're a different thing though
20:50:37 <Camail> are they
20:50:44 <Camail> why would a horse need a fanny back
20:51:06 <skrm> a horse wouldnt need saddle bags either
20:51:21 <skrm> its the idiot on top that needs bags
20:51:35 <Camail> horses dont need any storage
20:51:41 <Camail> so if we talk about storage at all, it's for the person
20:52:07 <skrm> maybe he filled the saddle bags with strong pornography and needs a place to store his clams and all he's got is a fanny pack
20:52:21 <Camail> are you projecting your needs onto a horse
20:52:25 <Camail> because thats a dark path
20:52:32 <Zounds> I like how the pornography is strong
20:52:32 <skrm> dont be silly
20:52:36 <skrm> i dont have any clams

20:52:55 <Zounds> does strong pornography take up more space?
20:53:39 <Camail> no, that's dense pornography
20:54:17 <skrm> no but it weighs your soul down
20:54:32 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@83.251.161.94] has joined #tlponies
20:54:44 <Zounds> you'd think dense would take up less space
20:54:51 <Zounds> might weigh more though yeah
20:55:18 <Camail> no see, you can compress the strong porn, but if its dense you can find any way to save space
20:55:30 <Camail> its the same volume but less compressible
20:55:51 <Camail> its not like 5 moles of densecore and 5 moles of strongcore
20:56:29 <skrm> would dense pornography be all your kinks at the same time
20:56:34 <Zounds> I'd exclusively peruse midget pornography if I was on a long journey
20:56:37 <Zounds> more compact
21:00:28 <skrm> good choice

22:20:06 <Zounds> It might just be us two depending on how many plates dub wants to make

22:55:35 <carcinisation> i think my fave game from comp overwatch on new account this evening was when team got mad at *winning* without any healers
22:57:52 <carcinisation> guess it was cause they'd already got mad over how game was already lost and didn't like being wrong
