00:00:13 <Camail> well, my second play through was only like 70 hours
00:00:23 <Camail> i didnt do everything, but i did quite a bit
00:01:21 <Camail> it's as close to dnd as you can get with a game
00:01:54 <Camail> to the point where you can make pseudo dnd campaign in the game
00:04:50 <Camail> it's BEYOND brutal if you play tactician mode without understanding which mechanics are the most impactful on combat
00:07:04 <Camail> there's one dumb plot point that happens at a certain important point in the story
00:07:45 <Camail> it's contrived as fuck, but it's really my only complaint
00:12:06 <Dot> hmm
00:15:01 <Camail> literally just keep in mind two things: turn order and whether they're weaker to physical or magical attacks
00:15:26 <Camail> everything else falls into place
00:16:06 <Camail> because on tactician everyone else is stronger than you so making them skip a turn you've already won
00:47:37 <Camail> i'd be interested in doing a pure magical damage run, because charm is so damn good
00:53:41 <Dot> i wannt to play a wizard in dnd at some point
01:02:21 <Camail> if i ever did, it would be as a utility wizard
01:02:32 <Camail> if i wanted to do damage i'd hit things
01:03:36 <Camail> i think it would be cool if clerics had a healing cantrip that only worked on conscious creatures
01:04:09 <Camail> i like support roles, but they aren't really doing much
01:11:55 <Dot> control wizards look really fun
01:27:12 <Dot> skrm, tohughts on wizards?
01:27:27 <skrm> magic is an abomination
01:32:50 <Camail> you play a druid
01:32:56 <Camail> so i assume you mean arcane magic
01:33:15 <Dot> skrm just really hates books
01:33:22 <Dot> af all kinds
01:33:39 <Dot> he wants to go back to 3.5 barb who was illitrate
01:34:03 <Camail> you can be illiterate if you want to
01:34:21 <Dot> forced illitracy is the only true way to freedom
