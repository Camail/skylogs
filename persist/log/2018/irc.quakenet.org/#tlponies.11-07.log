19:22:49 <skram> zounds why do british people end their text with xx
19:22:51 <skram> what does it mean
19:29:56 <reification> .u xx
19:31:34 <reification> is kisses skram
19:34:42 <Dot> skram pls
19:39:23 <Camail> x is a wave, xx is kissing, xxx is rough sex
19:39:59 <Camail> people have tried to imagine what xxxx is but then they die, so we dont really know
20:15:16 <skram> i thought british people were scared of intimacy
20:27:24 <Zounds> is that a thing?
20:28:16 <Zounds> We tend to dislike PDAs but we're as intimate as anybody
20:31:05 <Zounds> but we're also the homeland of dogging so maybe the public thing changed a bit over the years
20:31:23 <skram> thats a good point
20:56:44 <Camail> i just beat act 1 in sts in 4 minutes
20:56:50 <Camail> i dont think i will ever go faster than that
