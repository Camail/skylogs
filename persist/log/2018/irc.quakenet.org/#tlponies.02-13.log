21:53:30 <Camail> the only thing that isn't perfect is how it deals with errors on an individual basis
21:53:48 <Camail> butt thats an actual error handling problem and I'm like lol no
21:54:07 <Camail> jumping between python2.7 and java is a fucking brain equivalent of a tongue twister
21:54:39 <Camail> i know what i want to do but it takes twice as long to do anything without tripping on my own ass
21:56:03 <Camail> cool was just testing if putting a space before the "," would ruin anything, it does not
