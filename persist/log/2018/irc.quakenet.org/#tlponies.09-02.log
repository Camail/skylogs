02:03:13 <Dot> wel dressed horse
04:21:53 <DuB`> Just played like 9 hours of overwatch
04:21:55 <DuB`> mmmmm yeah
05:01:04 <Camail> dub you should get divinity 2, little 10% sale and the Big Patch came out
05:01:16 <Camail> great game apart from the soul crushing bugs on release
05:01:27 <DuB`> It keeps going on 10% sale and I keep hoping the next sale will be more % :P
05:01:34 <DuB`> I never got to D1 dlc! D:
05:01:51 <DuB`> If files are saved local and not cloud I'm sunk on that though...
05:01:54 <Camail> the first game doesnt matter
05:01:54 <DuB`> Was on old pc
05:02:24 <Camail> i never even touched the first game
05:08:37 <Phearlock> The storylines are like hundreds of years apart I think
05:09:01 <Phearlock> a couple of recurring characters but no story knowledge of the former required xD

15:05:03 <Runbunny> Nooes.
15:05:18 <skram> yes of course
15:05:19 <Runbunny> Honestly for honor has no appeal to me.

15:12:28 <Runbunny> Yeah Zounds only regards me as the dust under his boot.
15:12:43 <Zounds> I only asked you because I think you're the only other pon who owns the game
15:13:12 <Runbunny> Hmm? I don't even own for honor.
15:13:45 <Dot> game is free
15:13:47 <Dot> if i recall
15:13:56 <Zounds> wut I thought you did
15:14:11 <Zounds> You made comments about it last time I mentioned it
15:14:18 <Zounds> Maybe I got the wrong guy then
15:14:57 <Runbunny> Help Dot, Zounds thinks I am so commonplace that he can't even tell me apart.

15:15:44 <Zounds> fakk
15:16:51 <Dot> i dont know runbun, he seems to remember you better than you do yourself
15:17:00 <Dot> maybe you view yourself as commonplace
15:18:54 <Runbunny> Hmm. I do see myself like... all the time. and I am always there, no matter where I go.
15:25:02 <reification> maybe you need an out of body experience
15:27:54 <Zounds> I wanna do some dank team games
15:28:13 <Zounds> I usually do duels
