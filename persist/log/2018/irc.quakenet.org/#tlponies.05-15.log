01:10:59 <DuB`> Was gonna decide on a SF apartment this week, when grandma happened to mention that she had a cousing down there
01:11:52 <DuB`> She got in contact with her and chatted about loaning me a room, and they were way excited to help out family, refuse payment, and are gonna pick me up from airport and tour me around and everything
01:16:16 <Phearlock_> Awww, that's nice =D
01:18:19 <Crisium> DuB` is now rich

01:30:15 <skram> D:
01:30:21 <DuB`> This one's 3yr old, time for upgrade!
01:30:41 <skram> confusers are so expensive though!
01:30:58 <DuB`> And my brother and maybe some more family are gonna drive down to cali for mini-vacation and to pick me up at the end, so I'll be able to haul it home ez
01:31:05 <DuB`> Getting THIS one there would be hard
01:31:10 <skram> cool beans

01:33:28 <Camail> it's almost a waste of time to get a high performance gpu anymore
01:33:31 <DuB`> I'mma need some help getting new PC

01:47:13 <Crisium> pls
01:47:26 <Crisium> humans can appreciate up to at least 960hz
01:47:28 -!- Dot` [~quassel@90.197.149.26] has joined #tlponies
01:47:35 <Camail> the general consensus is that 144->240 is like 120->144
01:47:46 <Camail> at least that's everything I've heard
01:47:50 <Crisium> if your eyes are poverty maybe
01:47:59 <skram> haha
01:48:38 <skram> which monitor do you have crisminium
01:48:51 <Crisium> acer 27-inch
01:48:54 <Crisium> dunno the model
01:49:17 <skram> wowee
01:49:29 <skram> thats pretty expensive
01:49:45 <Crisium> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071D6NGMH/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
01:49:50 <Crisium> apparently they dont make it anymore? dunno
01:50:46 <skram> well i found a store that sells em
01:51:12 <skram> 750 dollarinos
01:51:13 <skram> hmm
01:51:36 <Crisium> i only spend money on food and gaming stuff so it was ez decion for me
01:51:46 <Crisium> id be a faster monitor if they made them
01:51:53 <Camail> make a pc out of food
01:52:05 <Crisium> hmm
01:52:31 <skram> I spend all my disposable income on shitty decisions or guitar pedals
01:53:30 <skram> im not even any good :(
01:53:48 <Crisium> u r good pon
01:54:37 <DuB`> The best, some say
01:55:15 <skram> flattery will get you anywhere
01:55:19 <skram> how can i help
01:55:38 <Crisium> get a 240hz monitr so you can carry me to GM
01:55:41 <Crisium> you are the only GM pon
01:56:11 <Micen|Droid> Skram needs a second account to boost me up to you 
01:56:46 <Crisium> free OW weekend on may 25th, everyone buy alt accounts and place them in silver for Micen
01:56:57 <DuB`> :D
01:57:05 <DuB`> That sounds fun lolol
01:57:07 <Micen|Droid> I like this plan
01:57:11 <DuB`> Can free account do ranked?
01:57:16 <DuB`> Feel like they shouldn't haha
01:57:25 <Crisium> hmm, i dunno
01:57:34 <Micen|Droid> The game is discounted on free weekends
01:57:35 <Crisium> i just know it takes forever to get to level 25
01:57:36 <Micen|Droid> Usually
01:57:39 <skram> well you need to be level 25 :p
01:57:46 <DuB`> Ah yes
01:57:46 <skram> thats like 15-20 hours of work
01:57:46 <Crisium> yeah, most people get alts during 50% off
01:57:54 <DuB`> Could do :P
01:58:02 <Crisium> i found another group of smurfs to queue with luckily
01:58:06 <Crisium> but its such a grind
01:58:06 <DuB`> Just to smurf though is ehhhhh
01:58:48 <skram> smurfs are kinda scummy :p
01:58:59 <Crisium> only if they dont play to win
01:59:12 <Micen|Droid> No dub, to carry micen without tanking your rank
01:59:28 <skram> well if you play to win eventually you're gonna catch up to your "main"
01:59:38 <Crisium> in theory
01:59:45 <Crisium> dont underestimate diamond hell tho
02:00:08 <Crisium> id rather play on my 5th best in masters than my 1st best in diamond
02:00:09 <skram> if you deliberately derank to be like a torbj√∏rn main or whatever you are the worst person
02:00:25 <Crisium> diamond by far is the worst rank
02:00:29 <skram> yeah i dont know cris, diamond is super inconsistent
02:01:00 <Crisium> i easily get 55% winrate in masters, but am lucky to get 50% in diamond
02:01:05 <Crisium> it's just an RNG fest
02:01:52 <skram> I dont think I had a positive win rate the season I got into GM actually
02:02:07 <Crisium> but how
02:02:26 <skram> something to do with stats and streaks i reckon
02:02:41 <Crisium> oh, was that back when they had bonuses for that?
02:02:59 <skram> think so
02:03:05 <skram> im certain personal performance was a factor at that time
02:03:45 <Crisium> ill just be a 3985 SR peak forever
02:03:53 <skram> rip
02:07:36 <Crisium> well gn pons
02:07:40 <Crisium> and gn magical girl skram
02:07:49 <skram> good night crisminium :p
02:08:33 <DuB`> nn
02:08:39 <DuB`> Hmmm

16:26:30 <reification> I go now. behave yourselves in my absence
16:26:38 <DuB`> (PARTY TIME)
16:29:35 <Cane> Hai DuB`. <3
16:29:59 <Cane> Are you still doing racing sim stuff?
16:30:36 <DuB`> I haven't used my wheel in a while, nothing in PC2 motivated me much
16:33:12 <Cane> Aw. Want to try Assetto Corsa? It's -75% off on Steam right now including all DLC, so it's super cheap. I can gift it to you.
16:34:10 <Cane> You have 25 minutes and 52 seconds to respond.
16:34:21 <DuB`> Uwah
16:34:23 <DuB`> Haha
16:34:41 <Cane> Daily ends then lol
16:35:42 <DuB`> What's the career mode like?
16:36:19 <DuB`> I feel like part of what bugs me about PC2 is that you kind of just start out with everything available and it didn't feel like there was anything to work for.
16:37:09 <Cane> I know what you mean. I think they wanted all kinds of careers to be open to all kinds of players from the word go.
16:37:34 <DuB`> Oooh, AC has Suzuka :P
16:38:05 <Cane> In Assetto Corsa you have to unlock more options as you play through the career mode, but on the flip side it's fairly barebones.
16:39:29 <DuB`> I'll probly go for it
16:39:34 <DuB`> Dun have to gift it though lol
16:39:40 <DuB`> THanks for letting me know about the sale!
16:39:55 <DuB`> $20 is ezzz
16:40:51 <Cane> Hahah that's fine, I just want to share the racing stuffs. <3
16:41:18 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
16:42:06 <DuB`> My PC crashed three times yesterday and kept changing my system clock to the same date but in 2022 >:T
16:42:24 <Dot`> spooky
16:42:41 <DuB`> And signed me out of everything each time, had to reconnect google/gmail, steam account and everything
16:42:42 <Cane> What I do like about Corsa's career mode is that as you play through it, you get to drive exhibition runs. Like there's one early on where you get to take a KTM X-Bow down Imola, just for fun.
16:43:28 <Cane> And you do have to work your way up, i.e. you start off in a very slow and safe car and eventually graduate to GT cars, then GT3, etc.
16:43:34 <Phearlock_> I found a chicken liver at work yesterday that had an expiration date in november 2045.
16:43:37 <Cane> But on the flip side, as I said, the "story" element is barely there.
16:43:42 <Cane> It's just "here's what you do today".
16:43:45 <Phearlock_> ...not really though, just someone mistyping.
16:43:46 <DuB`> yeah yeah
16:43:50 <Cane> PC and PC2 do a lot more to make you feel like you're racing on a team.
16:44:01 <Phearlock_> Had to throw it away cause incorrect labeling =P
16:44:43 <Cane> Also, Assetto Corsa took me longer to set up properly. A lot longer. The menus are a chore.
16:44:51 <DuB`> oke
16:44:53 <DuB`> Oh F
16:44:54 <Cane> Setting up wheel + stick + bindings etc.
16:44:58 <DuB`> My SSD is full :P
16:45:00 <Cane> lol
16:45:00 <DuB`> UHH
16:45:04 <Cane> It's kinda a big game.
16:45:13 <Cane> It loads most of the stuff into memory so you can put it on an HDD if you want to.
16:45:18 <Cane> Racing is still smooth as butter iirc.
16:45:24 <Cane> (Although mine is on my SSD)
16:45:37 <Cane> Load times aren't that bad anyway.
16:45:39 <DuB`> Er yeah, meant HDD
16:45:40 <DuB`> My big one
16:45:45 <Cane> LOL
16:45:46 <Cane> Oh
16:45:49 <Cane> That's a problem then. <3
16:47:49 <DuB`> Why is there 20GB of HotS...
16:47:50 <DuB`> zzz
16:54:22 <DuB`> OW is installed on both HDD and SSD?
16:54:33 <DuB`> ... I don't know which one it's launching from and don't want to break anything.
16:55:43 <DuB`> 100GB cleared
16:55:43 <DuB`> Phew
17:12:26 <DuB`> OH lol
17:12:47 <DuB`> Turns out rolly chair on hard floor is not conducive to using wheel+pedals
17:12:58 <Dot`> lol
17:13:08 <DuB`> I try to brake and just move backwards
17:13:33 <DuB`> Also I need to like tape the pedals to the floor or something

19:18:39 <skram> a lot
19:41:45 <Cane> <3
19:42:02 <Cane> Almost as much as Fl√•klypa Grand Prix, I'm sure.
19:46:07 <skram> Fl√•klypa is obviously the greatest movie ever made
19:46:25 <Runbunny> Hahaha
19:46:31 <Runbunny> It's pretty good.
19:49:02 <Cane> I remember a few years back there was a contest for "best Norwegian film ever". The film institute's own arty-farty bullshit pick was obviously Ni Liv, but for the public vote Fl√•klypa blitzed everything else obviously.
19:49:38 <Cane> "It is the most widely seen Norwegian film of all time, having sold some 5.5 million tickets since its release to a population which currently numbers just over 5 million."
19:49:43 <Cane> Sounds about right.

19:50:12 <skram> I dont think I know anyone who hasnt seen it Cane
19:50:35 <Cane> I love that without that film, we wouldn't have Koenigsegg.
19:51:04 <skram> really
19:51:08 <Cane> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_von_Koenigsegg
19:51:15 <skram> that makes sense in a way :P
19:51:26 <Cane> Oh yes.
19:52:09 <skram> his hobby was tuning mopeds
19:52:17 <Cane> And of course the film features the greatest car in the world. https://www.imcdb.org/i025471.jpg
19:53:15 <Cane> I'm so depressed that my model of that car is a wreck right now. I still have it, but all of the little bits have mostly fallen off by now.
19:54:07 <skram> You should go to Hunderfossen and look at it in the real
19:54:50 <Cane> That's on my bucket list.
19:56:59 <Cane> Btw skram, is Rudolf Blodstrupmoen the best bad guy name in history?
19:57:18 <skram> Well its either him or Mysil Bergsprekken
19:57:27 <Cane> There's not even any way to translate that into English without making it sound contrived, but it's just fantastic in Norwegian.
19:57:53 <Dot`> i back form walk
19:58:02 <Dot`> insides still disagree with me about walks
19:58:03 <Cane> Welcome back Dot` <3
19:58:07 <Dot`> hey cane <3
19:58:09 <skram> I've read some of his works and he is the best at names
19:58:18 <skram> Hey dot, let your insides be
19:58:27 <Dot`> no
19:58:35 <skram> RuuuUUuUde
19:58:40 <Dot`> i dont drink, i dont smoke, i keep the m healthly fed
19:58:43 <Dot`> and they do this to me?
19:58:51 <Cane> Sjeik Ben Redic Fy-Fazan.
19:58:54 <Cane> Yeah, he was pretty good at names.
19:58:55 <Dot`> i shall not stand for it
19:58:57 <skram> start smoking and drinking
20:00:43 <skram> kj√¶ra kj√¶ra, farli' norsk hengebro!
20:02:38 <Cane> That film is just wonderful. =)

20:06:45 <Cane> happened* even
20:07:47 <skram> too bad they're not allowed to use the turbine
20:12:11 <Cane> Man, now I want to watch Le Mans, actually.
20:12:31 <Cane> Hell, the real thing starts next month.
20:12:32 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
20:12:40 <Cane> Almost exactly.
20:13:21 <Camail> twitch is trying to figure out how tor educe latency
20:13:37 <skram> Its probably gonna be another Porsche victory
20:14:09 <Cane> Yeah, well hey, Nurburgring was close.
20:14:17 <Cane> And AMG had 3 cars in the top 5.
20:14:28 <Cane> LMP1 is a different beast but they're looking solid.
20:14:42 <Cane> Maybe actual competition will happen.
20:14:50 <skram> True, but Mercedes arent competing in le mans at all :(
20:15:11 <Camail> the low latency is only available to viewers using chrome
20:15:13 <Cane> Sigh, I know, there are some notable missing names. =/
20:16:24 <skram> There's a bunch of independent teams though
20:19:04 <skram> andre lotterer and bruno senna are racing for the rebellion team
20:19:22 <skram> dont know if bruno has posted any results but he's got pedigree which is sorta neat i guess
20:19:50 <Cane> And I'm always interested in LMGTE Pro stuff.
20:20:02 <Cane> That's where you get the 911s and Ford GTs and Vantages etc.
20:20:14 <skram> oh hell yeah
20:20:21 <Cane> Probably LMP1 will be Porsche though, you're right.
20:20:56 <skram> Cool to see the GT return
20:21:01 <skram> not as pretty as the GT40 but still
20:22:00 <Cane> There's gonna be like four GTs this year. That's impressive.
20:23:19 <skram> 2 aston martins and 2 c7 corvettes
20:24:03 <skram> would be cool with an upset victory in lmp1 though
20:24:08 <skram> toyota or one of the independent teams
20:24:31 <Cane> That would be fantastic.
20:26:20 <DuB`> Upset over who? :P
20:26:27 <DuB`> Audi and Porsche are out
20:27:24 <skram> really
20:27:36 <DuB`> https://www.motorsport.com/lemans/news/full-2018-le-mans-24-hours-entry-list-1003202/
20:27:47 <Cane> What? They were invited after last season.
20:27:56 <DuB`> Yep
20:27:57 <skram> i guess they declined lol
20:28:10 <Cane> Wow. Okay.
20:29:23 <skram> I guess 4 consecutive victories was enough then >_<
20:29:29 <DuB`> 2 Toyota and 8 private cars
20:30:05 <skram> rebellion has participated for quite a few years now
20:30:11 <skram> would be fun to see them win
20:30:46 <Zounds> What do they rebel against

20:31:30 <Dot`> Bio
20:31:37 <DuB`> I think I go exercise
20:32:37 <Cane> On a related note, I really hope that World Rally Championship is the most gentlemanly of sports, and that all of the countries of the world just decided, unanimously, that "Hey, France doesn't have much to be proud of, you know, so let's just give them a decade or so of winning rally championships, and then start taking things seriously again." Because I don't know for how much longer I can take people named Sebastien destroying everyone else.

21:45:59 <Camail> i wonder if we'll ever go back to the farm
21:46:20 <Camail> 50% of the game is socializing with all the npcs, but everyone just cares about one waifu
21:47:12 <Camail> also the ending to pillars 2 is way better if you make literally any other choice than the one i made my first time
21:47:32 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-161-94.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
21:47:48 <Camail> I did it in a clever way, but turns out games are more fun when you deal with problems and not completely skip them
21:47:51 <Bio> i'm certainly not done with the farm, but its more to just do stuff with muh frinds than the particular game
21:48:11 <Camail> farming was REALLY fun the first 2 days
21:48:14 <Bio> also
21:48:18 <Bio> no legendary
21:48:19 <Bio> RIP
21:48:25 <Camail> its still fun, but those early days were a blast
21:48:33 <Camail> bio have you considered gitting gud at rng
21:48:47 <Camail> you need to manipulate the seed by lawing down while you play
21:50:02 <Camail> I'd even be up to playing on new farms with other people or other hosts, but not going as nuts with the farming

21:54:02 <Camail> the money really helped but ultimately I think it would be interesting to make smaller farms with shitty sprinklers
