00:26:47 <Camail> bio pls
00:26:58 <Bio> camil pols
00:28:54 <Camail> we should shoot, at some point!
00:29:14 <Camail> all of a sudden people aren't here to get the ball rolling
00:29:21 <Bio> sure, if i can get this car shit sorted in a bit
00:29:23 <Camail> but i still remain hopeful
00:29:30 <Bio> bang
00:34:04 <Bio> bangu
00:36:50 <Bio> k well we can do a ranked if u want
00:39:06 <Camail> i'll do 5v5 or 2v2, w/e you feel like
00:39:28 <Bio> i'm down for 5v5
00:40:59 <Camail> steam is being dumb
00:42:12 <Camail> lets just use in game
00:42:14 <Camail> voice
00:42:18 <Bio> k
01:20:24 <Camail> you done?
01:21:57 <Camail> DuB`  if you want a break from space you can join us
02:02:40 <Bio> gg
02:02:56 <Camail> bio...speccing some of those guys was hilarious
02:03:06 <Bio> HAHA
02:03:33 <Bio> ye
02:03:35 <Bio> caps
02:03:37 <Camail> the panic in their hands was just...it almost made ME feel it
02:03:43 <Bio> i mostly specced you when i died
02:03:46 <Camail> SO FUNNY, LAUGH WITH ME
02:03:47 <Camail> HAHA
02:03:49 <Bio> HA
02:04:08 <Bio> the fear is real in silver games
02:04:21 <Camail> yea i had to IGL pretty hard on t side
02:04:29 <Camail> no one wants to do anything
02:04:40 <Camail> why play this game if you aren't gonna do anything
02:05:59 <Camail> but yea, it's a lessen in knowing where to aim your crosshair and how to deal with map control
02:06:16 <Camail> tbh i kinda went scrimmy in the last few rounds, but that's also a legit tactic
02:06:37 <Camail> high risk middling rewards is just fine if you only need 2 rounds
02:07:05 <Bio> YE
02:07:26 <Bio> i won a couple of gunfights, i am content
02:07:38 <Camail> yea, getting back into it is rough
02:07:41 <Camail> i was there 2 months ago
02:07:49 <Camail> where you dont even realize how much rust there is
02:08:16 <Bio> I kinda like what they did with duts two
02:08:27 <Bio> looks nice, even if i don't really like playing on it
02:08:36 <Camail> yea its a good remake
02:08:45 <Camail> especially since they made the doors wooden again
02:10:09 <Camail> no hackers, either
02:10:27 <Camail> which is not surprising given the rank, but still without prime
02:10:34 <Bio> Yeah, def felt like a legit game
02:10:39 <Camail> though i guess trust factor helps
02:11:08 <Bio> I feel like there may have been a smurf or two though =D
02:12:14 <Camail> eh, i dunno
02:12:22 <Camail> we certainly had a terrible team, tho
02:12:54 <Bio> yeh, they didn't really wanna banter
02:13:03 <Bio> like little sheep
02:13:59 <Camail> i cant beleive the coldzera fanboy didnt do the coldzera
02:14:06 <Camail> he literally was in the spot, there was a guy apps
02:14:07 <Bio> yeh
02:14:11 <Bio> very dissapoint
02:14:13 <Camail> and he just sat there like a bitch
02:18:09 <Bio> i shall have a new car this week

06:57:43 <DuB`> Brigitte - Shield Bash: Damage reduced from 50 to 5
06:58:06 <DuB`> Doomfist - Seismic Slam: Victims no longer lose air control while being pulled in.
06:58:21 <DuB`> Meteor Strike: Inner ring damage radius increased from 1.5m to 2.0m. This is the ring where Meteor Strike deals its full 300 damage. Max damage outside of inner ring decreased from 300 to 200. This is the ring where damage falloff happens, which still reduces the damage down to 15 at max range.

23:34:40 <Camail> ah, well that's more manageable, just more numbers
