00:22:38 <Cane> I really like DaHanG, but I feel like rapha is still a stronger player. His callouts are just nuts and he's so confidently aggressive.
00:29:35 <Camail> dahang has the better tourny record atm, but i think rapha has the best gamesense in quake so it's easy for him
00:30:07 <Camail> the calls aren't really substantive, mostly just timing reminders
00:33:50 <Camail> ranger looks fun to play
00:39:08 <Cane> Champions that look fun to play: Slash, Ranger, Nyx. Champions I can play: Clutch.
00:39:10 <Cane> Not the best overlap.
00:46:08 <Camail> everyone can play clutch
00:46:19 <Camail> shield up then have a nice cup of tea
00:46:30 <Camail> then remember you're playing quake and aim at them
00:47:11 <Camail> galena is really fun
00:47:20 <Camail> i've played pretty much only her
00:47:36 <Cane> Oh yeah? I should try her more. If we were gonna do 2v2 stuff at some point I was thinking one of us should Galena just for the ez mode heal.
00:47:55 <Camail> i think she's map dependent, she needs places to hide the totem
00:48:11 <Camail> the map they're playing right now is good for her
00:49:22 <Cane> What's the Skaal drone dude's name again? I kinda like him.
00:49:59 <Camail> i cant recall, he is fun tho. kinda squishy but the drone is nuts
00:50:30 <Camail> you have to be confidant in your map control to use him tho, it's like if junkrat actually took brains
00:54:59 <Cane> God damn, Nyx looks so good. That ghostwalk is great.
00:55:16 <Cane> And she has a wall jump so she can reach shit better.
00:55:40 <Cane> As far as movement abilities go, phasing through enemies and projectiles is a pretty good one.
00:56:14 <Bio> pani
01:00:41 <Camail> her only issue is she's basically already dead, even when she's stacked it's not great
01:01:51 <Camail> i dont like having 50 armor
01:04:31 <Camail> man, i use twitch clips 99% of the time to rewatch something i misheard
01:06:52 <Camail> https://clips.twitch.tv/InspiringCrypticLatteKeyboardCat comments on The Play
01:07:13 <Camail> hmmm, apparently i didnt write anything for clips
01:07:29 <Camail> oh right i did vods, but clips didnt exist
01:07:36 <Camail> i should add that
01:08:13 <Camail> keel is so strong for extended fights
01:13:26 <Cane> Omg such a hipster.

01:25:59 <Camail> those are the games yenom got the ringer

22:47:44 <Camail> oh jesus its problem x vs batman
22:47:50 <Cane> How's Problem X been in SFV?
22:48:03 <Cane> I liked him in 4 but he wasn't really competitive. He was getting there when it died.
22:48:25 <Camail> he hits top 8s, won an NA tourny earlier this year, cant recall which
22:48:50 <Cane> Good to hear he's getting really solid.

23:45:11 <Camail> rimworld seems fun, but its simultaneously too much to learn all at once, and also absolutely nothing to do because your goals are self determined
23:45:17 <Camail> i dont think the dorf genre is for me
23:45:41 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-163-99.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
23:47:25 <Dot`> dorf fort use to be a lot harder to just not lose
23:47:34 <Dot`> so many things could go wrong, normaly tantrum spirals
23:48:27 <Dot`> but yea, if you dont want to read a wiki for 6 hours probably not fun for you
23:49:55 <Camail> all i need is a story
23:50:04 <Dot`> i have to be in a very particular mood for dorf fort as its depth is unriviled but it can be a slog to learn
23:53:27 <Dot`> Rimworkd is like a basic dorf fort thats actually playable without hours of reading
23:53:31 <Dot`> AND has graphics
23:53:34 <Dot`> very fancy
