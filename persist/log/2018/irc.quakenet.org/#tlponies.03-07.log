03:17:32 <Cane> Camail, you are the top FORCED player on my friends list. I hope you're proud.
03:17:59 <Camail> whether anyone else bought it, is a different story
03:18:04 <Camail> hard game is hard
03:18:35 <Cane> Records say at least 8 Steam friends completed the various tutorial levels, and your time was way better than everyone elses.
03:18:52 <Cane> Most of those players didn't stick with it for long though.
03:19:14 <DuB`> Is that the game you and dot made me buy and then we played ONCE?
03:19:15 <Camail> yea we went hard on that game for like, a week
03:19:18 <DuB`> Haha
03:19:27 <Camail> hey i played it a few times
03:19:30 <Camail> and would continue to play
03:19:35 <Camail> but everyone else stopped
03:19:40 <Camail> then they left tlp
03:19:46 <Cane> Rude.
03:19:46 <Camail> (2 years later)
03:20:02 <Camail> I'd still play it
03:21:19 <Cane> Is it the kind of game that works with 2 players or do you really need a group?
03:23:00 <Crisium> i played that once with you guys
03:23:10 <Crisium> yeah, you made me buy it and we played 1 time lul
03:23:25 <Camail> you can technically solo it
03:23:31 <Crisium> i think i played it more than once actually
03:23:35 <Crisium> it was a few days we went at it
03:23:42 <Bio> *Cough coop-coins when Cough*
03:23:44 <Camail> yea cris we duo'd a few days
03:23:52 <Camail> but we hit walls and it was pretty ruthless
03:24:01 <Camail> so the motivation was lossed
03:24:02 <Cane> Bio, currently playing Heroes of Hammerwatch with SD and Rael, day 1 was great.
03:24:02 <Crisium> with like catties and scint
03:24:30 <Camail> yea we played with zk, catties, scint, you, dub
03:24:32 <Bio> Those are names I haven't heard in a long while
03:24:52 <Bio> I DID see you guys in disc that one day
03:25:11 <Camail> Cane  the game is best with multiple people, imo, the more the better
03:25:32 <Crisium> well, i will accept the call if needed
03:25:37 <Cane> That's what I figured.
03:25:42 <Crisium> not that i remember how to play, would need tutorial again
03:25:48 <Camail> the main mechanic is you pass a ball of light to each other
03:25:59 <Camail> in solo its a lot like throwing a ball to yourself
03:26:54 <Cane> Ohhh, you all navigate the spirit together. That explains it.
03:27:01 <Cane> It was a chore in solo play.
03:27:09 <Camail> and I'd play forced, but I already evangelize for enough games, can only get people to do so many new things
03:27:16 <Camail> unless its overwatch
03:27:38 <Camail> yea, we can try multiplayer if you want, cane
03:28:32 <Cane> I might ask about that in a few days. Gotta get Heroes of Hammerwatch mostly done while StarDragon is around to play.
03:29:14 <Camail> his time is fleeting
03:30:19 <Cane> Yesterday he said he'd "be home and ready to play in 2 hours." As is tradition we had to do a bit of conversion to get the proper time. It's like converting to fahrenheit -- you double it and add 40.
03:30:42 <DuB`> :D
03:30:47 <Cane> 3 hours and 35 minutes later, we hear a coughing fit in Discord.
03:30:54 <Cane> That was his way of saying hello, was 5 minutes of nearly uninterrupted coughing.
03:32:13 <Camail> yea sounds right
03:32:37 <Cane> Once we got all the pleasantries sorted though we had fun playing Hammerwatch.
03:33:19 <Bio> he hasn't changed at all
03:33:20 <Bio> lol
03:34:21 <Cane> I need to get better at tanking. StarDragon hasn't quite grasped the concept of shooting his ranger arrows from behind me.

22:38:39 <Phearlock__> I got it at 75% speed but that does not count.
22:39:19 <Phearlock__> I got a slightly easier version that does 150 damage less, which is also nice but does not count =P
