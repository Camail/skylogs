11:37:34 <Cane> I finally picked up Planet Coaster. So far it's fun, but then I am a madman who likes tinkering with scenery and parks a whole lot.
11:38:11 <Cane> It's scratching that Theme Park itch I remember having when I was a kid.
11:39:34 <Cane> One thing I really like is all the happy faces. It's fun just walking down the pathways and seeing everyone pointing and laughing at entertainers or fireworks or whatever. Really good detail work.
11:40:06 <Cane> And then a pickpocket shows up BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS TO RUIN IT FOR EVERYONE, and I'm forced to put up more cameras and hire more security and I start to hate people again.

14:41:19 <Cane> And one single toilet on the other side of the map, so by the time they get back to the entrance they're thirsty again.

18:20:02 <DuB`> oh oh
18:20:04 <Dot> i installed bobs once
18:20:24 <Dot> it adds so much teck is becomes stupid

18:24:25 <Bio> become things

18:26:14 <skrm> most difficult of all the parts is to balance production and consumption
18:26:36 <Camail> the most important thing i never sued was saturating the belts properly
18:26:46 <Camail> i didnt know you could use splitters to make it so clean
18:27:03 <Dot> belts got a massive rework recently
18:27:19 <Camail> how massive can you change a tile that moves stuff

18:47:14 <Camail>  i just read about the changes, all it did was that it broke splitter belt compression and made it automatic
18:47:33 <Camail> i suppose that's massive, but only for the guys who are already super deep intot he specific mechanics
18:48:00 <DoT|Phone> there was more
18:50:37 <Camail> in .15 there was belt optimization, but that made things better
18:50:49 <Camail> also when are they gonna bite the bullet and make v1
18:50:59 <Camail> ffs that have enough of a game
18:51:11 <Camail> unless they are going for like $30-$50 as a price tag
18:51:14 <DoT|Phone> Yea. belts where improved a lot because drones where so much better
18:51:40 <Bio> 1.0 is coming soon
18:51:53 <Bio> i think i read next patch is ui/campaign stuff
18:51:55 <Bio> then 1.0
18:52:36 <Camail> i wanted to get to a point where i could get bots going but i never had enough resources to reach a level of efficiency
18:52:54 <Camail> then got bored and did other stuff
18:53:19 <Bio> i've gotten by with 4 lanes of iron and copper, and split off from there
18:53:41 <Camail> mechanics alone are not enough to get me interested in a game for very long
18:54:23 <Camail> i should love bayonetta but dear god it's so boring to me
