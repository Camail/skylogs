03:27:11 <Phearlock_> =(
03:27:58 <Camail> so basically they're just gonna up the pain meds and go until it's all over
03:29:00 <Camail> it's a real bummer, but it's a reminder for all of us to be more mindful of our bodies. He didn't go to a doctor until it was fully developed cancer
03:29:56 <Camail> it stings even more knowing that maybe they could've prevented all this if he caught it early
03:44:53 <Camail> i kinda want to start fishing, gonna read up on that
03:45:07 <Camail> like, if it's worth grinding fish
03:45:13 <Camail> we have enough to buy fishing poles
03:45:39 <DuB`> Fishin is its own whole thing for bundles
03:45:45 <DuB`> Would be useful in that sense, at least
03:46:21 <Bio> i just want some fuckin cheese and mayo boys
03:46:45 <DuB`> SIX fishing bundles
03:47:43 <Camail> making crab pots seems useful
03:47:59 <Camail> you'll get mayo soon
03:48:39 <Dot> hello pons
03:48:44 <Camail> I'll try and get on a bit earlier so we can have people playing throughout the day
03:48:51 <Dot> how stardew valley go?
03:48:52 <Camail> still dunno if more than the original 3 people can join
03:48:57 <Camail> it was really fun dot
03:49:06 <Camail> want to test out if you can join the map, dort?
03:49:59 <Bio> would be good science

03:50:35 <Camail> leah, emily, abigail, and penny are spoken for in this map
03:50:51 <Dot> well where is the point then!
03:51:02 <Camail> haley is hot
03:51:04 <DuB`> :P
03:51:17 <Dot> did dub go for abigail, because we talked about this
03:51:27 <DuB`> No!
03:51:35 <DuB`> Haley in my solo game, Emily in the group one.
03:52:04 <Camail> skram is
03:52:18 <Camail> they were gonna fight for emily
03:52:36 <Camail> still think skram should go for shane
03:52:57 <Dot> its a good fit
03:53:06 <Camail> he refuses
03:53:17 <Camail> tho me and skram are currently in an open relationship
03:53:23 <Camail> i cant wait for our wives to live with us
03:53:42 <Bio> just like one of those degenerate animees
03:53:45 <Camail> bio is waaaay ahead of the game because he can get good gifts quickly
03:53:59 <Bio> literally buy lettuce from the bar
03:54:22 <Dot> well leah is best
03:55:28 <Camail> literally siphoning off money for his harlot
03:55:42 <Camail> tho he works for it
03:55:45 <Camail> unlike dub and skram
03:56:04 <Dot> bunch of freeladers
03:56:29 <DuB`> Just because it's DIFFERENT work from what you're doing doesn't mean it's not work!
03:56:42 <DuB`> We toil in the mines from 8am until after midnight every day
03:57:13 <DuB`> Just because we're not "watering" the "crops", sheesh...
03:57:28 <Camail> but we get the MONEY
03:57:42 <Bio> we've probably made like fuckin 50k worth of parsnips in spring by the end of it
03:58:03 <Camail> if we planted the 400 again, maybe
03:58:09 <Camail> but we're down to ~100
03:58:14 <Camail> so proably low 40k
03:58:23 <Bio> well, we have to restart the day =D
03:58:29 <Bio> THERES ALWAYS TIME
03:58:31 <Camail> Dot  I bough, and me and bio planted, 300 parsnips in a day
03:58:46 <Dot> very industraius
03:58:59 <Camail> i think I'll be mentally ok with spending all that money on parsnips, but that requires dub to spend all day farming too
03:59:09 <Camail> which isn't bad
03:59:26 <Bio> it will mean we have a super nice big farm for summer
03:59:51 <Bio> aka
03:59:55 <Bio> BLUEBERRIES
04:00:16 <DuB`> I don't mind helping farm especially when skram is gone
04:00:39 <DuB`> Hard to push solo in mines past 80 when I don't want to spend money on gear
04:00:51 <DuB`> Because money is for SEEDS
04:03:53 <Camail> next season is blueberries one day one, then we can do wahetever we want
04:04:11 <Camail> on day one*
04:04:36 <Camail> honestly we just need a base crop of blueberries and we can all do whatever we want after that
04:04:55 <Camail> gotta use the best fertilizer we can tho
04:08:35 <Bio> yeh
04:08:44 <Bio> think we just have the normal fert right now
04:10:30 <Camail> I think I might make some blueberry jelly
04:10:39 <Camail> you can make kegs
04:11:04 <Camail> you gotta make some taps tho
04:11:13 <Bio> yeah i can make a few
04:11:28 <Bio> try to not cut down all of our trees, haha
04:11:48 <Camail> we mgiht have to lower our parsnip production so we can farm for summer set up
04:12:22 <Camail> I'll go south and cut those
04:12:22 <Bio> we can get one more crop in before the season turns for sure
04:12:51 <Camail> yea we can, my point is that we cant do huge yields because we need that time to get stuff, i need wood stone and coal
04:13:02 <Camail> so maybe 150-200 at most
04:15:28 <Camail> also once summer hits we should have a cleaner crop style
04:15:51 <Bio> yarp
04:16:34 <DuB`> ?
04:16:47 <Camail> like, pretty it up
04:17:09 <Camail> get everything around a scarecrow, have spaces for iridium sprinklers planned out
04:17:54 <DuB`> Ye
04:17:57 <DuB`> Nice
04:18:04 <DuB`> Man, I have no motivation to play my solo game now
04:18:11 <DuB`> 4-man is much cooler :P
04:18:28 <DuB`> Mine lv80 and huge crops long before summer
04:18:53 <DuB`> Not as far in relationship hearts, but that's just because birthday hasn't come yet
04:20:15 <Camail> yea
04:20:24 <Camail> and its like...i dont wanna play without anyone else either
04:20:34 <Camail> i wanna play but i dont want to get too far
04:21:05 <Camail> multiplayer is way more fun than i thought it would be
04:22:50 <Camail> hmmmm, thinking about using a texture pack
04:22:58 <Camail> kinda want to spice things up visually
04:24:37 <DuB`> Yeah it's not something you can just do a little bit on your own, any amount of effort will still forward the days 
04:31:24 <Camail> jellies dont seem to be super worth it year one
04:33:52 <Camail> yea I'll go artisan at farming 10, but we'll be doing wines
04:34:14 <Camail> we should set up some trees this next day
04:34:38 <Camail> which means planting acorns
04:34:39 <Camail> lots
04:35:26 <DuB`> Sounds cool
04:35:35 <DuB`> Can't decide what tree I wanna go there
04:35:46 <Camail> what you did well was give us metals
04:35:52 <DuB`> Artisan + cooking does sound pretty comprehensive
04:36:07 <DuB`> Of course, I'm all combat+mining for now
04:36:09 <Camail> I'm just going artisan to get us money
04:36:21 <Camail> i gotta put food on the table somehow
04:36:23 <Camail> feed your addiction
04:36:26 <DuB`> Hehehe
04:36:33 <Camail> especially once you finish with the mine
04:36:52 <Bio> we can have a forest in the bottom left prolly
04:37:00 <Camail> yea, we have plenty of space
04:37:17 <Camail> I'm glad we ended up using the vanilla land
04:37:27 <Camail> cant really establish everyone's hobbies
04:37:29 <Camail> can*
04:37:49 <Camail> my hobby will be making gift fruits
04:38:59 <Camail> oh kegs are for farming 8
04:39:20 <Camail> we might have to go hard on farming and let only one of us get the crops
04:40:13 <Camail> dub which mining line are you going with
04:40:24 <DuB`> Haven't looked at those
04:40:40 <DuB`> Was just looking at crit v flat boosts in the combat stuff
04:40:54 <Camail> miner with +1 ore is rally good for iridium but the lvl 10 stuff is meh
04:41:04 <Camail> really*
04:41:23 <Camail> multiple gems is meh, double geodes is neat
04:41:48 <DuB`> Hmm
04:41:55 <DuB`> Gems are mostly just for gifts, not super
04:42:02 <DuB`> Never gonna be better money than farming stuff
04:42:15 <Camail> yea the +money options are useless
04:42:22 <Camail> its either more geodes or more ore
04:42:26 <DuB`> Ye probly miner
04:42:34 <Camail> that and the coal skill are nice
04:42:46 <Camail> have you guys been looting the coal carts
04:42:51 <DuB`> Yup
04:42:57 <Camail> yea those are tasty
04:43:59 <Camail> also crit chance + only matter if your weapon has good crit chance
04:44:07 <Camail> because its 50% of that
04:44:13 <DuB`> Yeah
04:44:30 <DuB`> I read that it's really never statistically better than just the two +dmg%, but...
04:44:55 <DuB`> Would be more fun that just dumb % stat buff
04:45:25 <Camail> combat in this game isn't very nuanced
04:54:23 <Camail> Bio  oh snap each season has 28 days, not 30
04:54:30 <Camail> completely forgot, that changes a bit of the math
04:54:36 <Bio> tru
04:54:43 <Bio> are we on day 24 or 25
04:55:26 <Camail> lemme check
04:55:52 <Camail> 23
04:55:59 <Bio> o
04:56:00 <Camail> so if we plant TODAY, its the last crop
04:56:00 <Bio> we gud
04:56:15 <Camail> also neither of use are level 8 to make kegs
04:57:15 <Bio> we can powerlevel one of us
04:57:21 <Camail> and we wont get to lvl 8 any time soon
04:57:38 <Camail> we're at 5, which is 2150 xp
04:57:46 <Camail> its 6900 total to lvl 8
04:57:53 <Camail> 8 xp per snip
04:58:24 <Camail> thats 600 parsnips
04:58:55 <Bio> soooo
04:59:01 <Bio> we are buying 600 parsnips?
04:59:04 <DuB`> lul
04:59:08 <Camail> no, we dont need lvl 8 on day one
04:59:13 <Bio> lol
04:59:26 <Camail> whatever crop we go with  it will have some grow time
04:59:38 <Camail> we can farm a shorter crop for quick xp/cash then make kegs
04:59:49 <Camail> in the meantime we can get the resources for em
04:59:59 <Bio> Blueberry wine bois
05:00:23 <Camail> so i was looking and its not that great
05:00:31 <Camail> we want a low yeild high cost fruit for win
05:00:48 <Camail> blueberries are good to sell raw, or to put in jars
05:01:01 <Bio> treu
05:01:04 <Camail> but we cant produce enough jars to consistantly make a lot of jelly
05:01:55 <Camail> melon wine might be good
05:02:38 <Camail> red cabbage is good
05:05:05 <Camail> pale ale might be a good alternative
05:05:32 <Bio> booz
05:06:00 <Bio> anyway
05:06:01 <Bio> i slep
05:06:01 <Bio> nn
05:06:07 <BioSleep> nnnnnnn
05:06:17 <Camail> cya
05:13:35 <Camail> dub you can buy a big ol' sword once we get set up in summer, i dont think we'll 0 out on crops this time
05:14:21 <DuB`> Ye
05:14:28 <DuB`> More interested in rings first
05:14:36 <DuB`> Have 2x magnet rings on right now, no stats out of those
05:15:53 <Camail> yea
05:16:15 <Camail> i couldnt imagine plaything with profit nerfs
05:16:30 <Camail> we're making BANK and just barely staying in the black with tool overhead
05:18:14 <Camail> fuck, this game is fun
05:18:18 <Camail> and now we have purpose
05:18:24 <Camail> and a big, community house
05:18:29 <Camail> where we all sleep together
05:18:45 <DuB`> Very good time
05:24:22 <Camail> i think if we powerlevel me in farming, we can balance that by getting bio his animal stuff
05:24:29 <Camail> you can get stuff
05:28:09 <DuB`> I'm looking forward to the animal stuff too, I've not seen any of that yet
05:28:31 <Camail> well its going up near bio's place in the south west
05:28:43 <Camail> takes a few days to build

05:49:19 <Camail> damn that was a good episode of boku no hero
05:54:25 <Camail> i might make red cabbage preserves
05:54:40 <Camail> hmmm, i dunno
05:54:53 <Camail> kegs and jars are really more year 2...
05:55:31 <Camail> they dont scale well unless you have the resources
05:55:49 <Camail> but i guess it's something you start making year one and use throughout the years
05:59:21 <Camail> either way, I'm thinking melons are our best bet, we have a few already, and we can stockpile them to make win once we get there

18:38:57 <Zounds> muh reif
19:55:34 <carcinisation> hey zounds

20:50:39 <Dot`> hey Crisium
20:50:48 <Crisium> hei
21:04:36 <Runbunny> Hai.
21:06:09 <Crisium> i cant get over how silly this is https://clips.twitch.tv/KathishHeadstrongSnailDAESuppy
21:06:20 <Crisium> only masochists play Reinhardt in OW right now
21:08:51 <Zounds> Isn't he still important for the popular comps atm
21:09:02 <Crisium> yes, which is why it sucks
21:09:13 <Crisium> someone needs to play him, and get bounced around like a pinball
21:09:26 <Zounds> It's weird that he's in a better position and a worse position at the same time =P
21:09:33 <Crisium> yup, but thats blizz for ya
21:10:08 <Crisium> the only good thing going on right now is that it may be possible to sneak Ana into games
21:10:19 <Crisium> as long as there is not more than 1 diver it should be fine
21:10:30 <Crisium> and usually there's just one
21:10:35 <Crisium> or even none right now
21:11:00 <Crisium> .tell Micen https://clips.twitch.tv/RelatedFunnyHamsterJonCarnage
21:12:33 <Crisium> turns out Torb can be good if you are a god
21:13:07 <Zounds> His gun is pretty good after all
21:13:11 <Zounds> Both left and right click
21:13:26 <Crisium> on paper yeah, its just so hard to hit shots
21:15:02 <Zounds> Mhm
21:16:12 <Zounds> Spamming chokes at typical headshot height works pretty well ^^
21:20:51 <Crisium> yeah, he's best as a spammer at head level, or just at tanks/barriers.  then right click when everyone gets in close.  turret helps keep tracer in check pretty well btw, if tracer can't kill someone in 1 clip+melee then the turret is a real threat
21:21:13 <Crisium> make torb meta
21:21:32 <Crisium> hopefully the rework doesnt change things too much, i sort of feel sym is losing some identity
21:23:07 <Zounds> Her identity is a noob farming pain in the ass at the moment
21:23:20 <Crisium> well she also builds cancer comps with brig now
21:23:44 <Crisium> not sure if it'll be actually viable
21:23:56 <Zounds> I love the sound of the proposed symm changes way more than her current stuff
21:24:14 <Crisium> i do overall, but i will miss shield gen
21:24:27 <Zounds> Aesthetically she's always been one of my faves
21:24:33 <Zounds> I even played her a fair amount early on
21:24:41 <Zounds> But she's just too...meh
21:25:33 <Crisium> na, at this point im probably gonna be Soldier, Torb, Sym only for DPS.  occasional Reaper or Soldier.  not really into the rest
21:25:46 <Crisium> er. occasional Reaper or Tracer
21:26:10 <Crisium> though I will play Hanzo after rework, since his projectile speed will be same as Ana's.  gotta build those transferable skills
21:26:16 <Zounds> Hehe
21:26:33 <Zounds> Well that's a decent amount of heroes to play
21:26:57 <Crisium> not even half the DPS cast tho lol
21:27:04 <Crisium> so many deeps
21:27:53 <Zounds> I'll probably play the new hanzo too
21:29:26 <Zounds> Hanzo vs Widow duels are gonna be a lot tougher for most Widows I think
21:29:34 <Zounds> WIth the sonic uptime and projectile speed
21:29:49 <Crisium> true
21:34:37 <Zounds> Just as I was getting into my boy Genji he seems to be losing his place in cc watch though
21:35:29 <Zounds> Though I'm not entirely upset to see flankers getting their butts kicked for once
21:38:49 <Zounds> Of course genji is no stranger to getting his butt kicked, compared to tracer at least
