00:03:54 <skrm> oh hey
00:04:00 <skrm> winter olympics starts tomorrow
00:04:23 <skrm> sure hope the ski lube boss has done his job this year
00:06:07 <DuB`> The wat
00:07:31 <skrm> The guy in charge of lubricating the skis, dub!
00:07:50 <DuB`> I thought that's what the snow was for
00:07:51 <skrm> Its a very prestigious position
00:07:57 <Crisium> lube
00:08:06 <skrm> Haha! Look at this guy.
00:08:26 <DuB`> How many times have you been skiing, skram?
00:08:37 <skrm> At least 3.
00:08:52 <DuB`> ...
00:09:14 <DuB`> I ihave been dozens of times and not once was lube involved.
00:09:25 <skrm> On cross country skiis you put wax on them so they're not slippy backwards
00:09:37 <DuB`> Well cross country is silly
00:09:45 <DuB`> Skiing is for MOUNTAINS.
00:09:46 <skrm> HOW
00:09:47 <skrm> DARE
00:09:48 <skrm> YOU
00:09:53 <Crisium> skram he is in the rocky mountains
00:09:55 <Crisium> what u exepct
00:09:55 <DuB`> MOUNTAINS, SKRAM.
00:10:31 <skrm> You can go downwards on xcountry skis too
00:10:43 <skrm> but downhill skis only go one direction
00:11:18 <skrm> Maybe you spoiled sumbitches got ski lifts on every god damned mountain, but that just means ur lazy and entitled
00:11:28 <skrm> fucking millenials rabble rabble

00:11:47 <DuB`> Not my fault I live in one of the greatest ski areas in the world!
00:12:15 <DuB`> Check out the UT license plate: http://www.15q.net/us5/ut08.jpg
00:13:35 <Dot`> thast... very american
00:14:10 <skrm> Every fucking town in america is "... of the world" or biggest this or the whatever capital of america
00:14:20 <DuB`> :P
00:15:04 <skrm> Somehow having the biggest ball of twine is a big deal
00:15:08 <skrm> America is weird
00:15:13 <Dot`> they are a very young natioan skram, and are obviosly feeling threatend by great EU history
00:15:27 <DuB`> srs tho, you could fly into SLC airport and be at any one of seven ski resorts within 30 minutes.
00:16:56 <DuB`> Go Dragons!
00:16:59 <DuB`> BEAT THE FUEL
00:17:07 <Crisium> dallas getting rolled
00:17:09 <DuB`> >:D

00:18:59 <Dot`> very much so
00:19:31 <DuB`> I do envy your old stuff
00:19:40 <DuB`> Oldest building in my state is only 160. :T
00:20:54 <skrm> Eh, old stuff is overrated
00:21:50 <skrm> Childhood friend of mine lived in a 300 year old timber house on a farm and it was almost as cold as the outside in winter
00:22:34 <skrm> ...She also used to tell me there were bats in it but I never saw any
00:22:35 <Crisium> poor nordic countries and their wooden houses
00:22:40 <DuB`> I think there were maybe indian teepees around here that long ago?
00:23:26 <Crisium> it's ok, sweden was considered a regional power as recently as 400 years ago
00:23:30 <Bio> oh man
00:23:37 <Bio> I nailed these steaks
00:23:46 <Crisium> trump steaks?

16:57:19 <Dot`> not much to tell, it had marmite and that bread that isnt white but isnt brown
16:57:24 <Dot`> just a kind of midway
17:00:06 <Golly> mulatto bread
17:00:52 <Micen|Droid> Rye is best bread
17:03:55 <Zounds> Some 50/50 dot?
17:04:02 <Zounds> that's quite decent
17:04:23 <Zounds> Though I like almost any kind of bread
17:06:00 <Micen|Droid> I need to go to euro land and try breads there. I hear american breads are far more sweet
17:08:13 <reification> i need to make spelt bread again

17:10:12 <Dot`> spelt bread
17:10:13 <Micen|Droid> Googled it. Never heard of it
