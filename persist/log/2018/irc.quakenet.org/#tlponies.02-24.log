21:11:59 <Camail> rabbits?
21:13:12 <Camail> kingdom come shines when you ignore the main story and stay super weak and shit at combat
21:13:37 <Camail> it's relatively easy to become an unbeatable god who makes thousands killing bad guys and selling their stuff
21:14:13 <Camail> but if you ignore that income source all of a sudden the game gets real, and it has a lot of tools to bring you into the immersion of being a shitty peasant
21:16:18 <Dot`> i return
21:16:52 <Bio> hallo
21:17:03 <Bio> peasants are dirty
21:20:24 <Camail> yea, if i end up making a new save I'll have to try the full crime side
21:32:31 <Dot`> is the game early access?
21:44:44 <Camail> IT FEELS LIKE IT
21:44:51 <Camail> caps
21:44:59 <Camail> its euro jank
21:45:22 <Camail> lots of little bugs and weird things, terrible optimization
21:45:25 <Dot`> ive watch a little of dansgaming play it, and it just looks a bit unfinished
21:45:56 <Camail> welcome to euro jank
21:46:10 <Camail> witcher 1, witcher2, stalker, feels like that
21:46:36 <Dot`> witcher 1 i never got into becuase of the combat, never played 2
21:46:46 <Dot`> stalker... its certinaly janky
21:46:48 <Camail> its like, if the people involved think j is a soft letter, it has a certain lowered bar of quality
21:47:52 <Dot`> lol
21:50:52 <Camail> for example, i am doing a stealth mission where you are supposed to fail
21:51:11 <Camail> but the fail state i got teleported maybe 8-9 guys around me stabbing me until i die
21:51:33 <Dot`> was that the one on the castle wall?
21:51:37 <Camail> you are supposed to heroically escape, but i think they messed up how they load in NPCs
21:51:55 <Camail> a guy gets shot in the ass, if that helps
21:52:36 <Dot`> I only saw a small part, but a ladder got put up a wall at night
21:52:42 <Camail> yea that one
21:52:50 <Dot`> haha
21:53:03 <Camail> i got to the end where you're discovered, and the cinematic went from one archer finding us and shooting us
21:53:17 <Camail> to 8 guys cornering us in an alley swarming me while i try and brgin an injured guy out
21:53:26 <Camail> like, surely that's not supposed to happen
21:56:39 <Dot`> yea, thats weird
22:04:26 <Bio> dort i got robits
22:04:32 <Bio> they do things
22:04:52 <DuB`> GGS
22:04:53 <DuB`> Oof
22:05:01 <DuB`> I've played like 60hrs of OW in the last 3 weeks :D
22:05:18 <Rawr|Fone> What a nerdpon
22:05:21 <Camail> ALSO MY HORSE IS MAGICAL
22:05:25 <Bio> ^
22:05:31 <Camail> AND WHILE I WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CASTLE CHILLING
22:05:33 <Dot`> nice bio
22:05:33 <Camail> caps
22:05:34 <Camail> jfc
22:05:37 <Camail> this game uses caps lock
22:05:42 <Dot`> haha
22:05:43 <Camail> and i dont look at my screen when i type
22:05:44 <Kittybunny> O:
22:05:52 <DuB`> Haha
22:06:02 <DuB`> I use caps for discord ptt, I know how it is
22:06:03 <Camail> i was doing a stealth misison and caps toggles walk
22:06:31 <Camail> i dont want to be classified as a dub

22:06:44 <DuB`> :(
22:06:56 <Camail> i just dont sexually identify as a dub
22:07:00 <Camail> are you trying to misgender me
22:12:35 <Camail> but yea, its a fun game, honestly
22:12:44 <Camail> it almost feels like two games, which i think was by design
22:13:10 <Camail> the class divide makes it feel like the main quest is full of cut scenes and daring adventures
22:13:26 <Camail> but you can sneak into people's houses get caught, get fucked and sent to jail
22:13:30 <Camail> then everyone hates you
22:31:05 <Camail> ok i just tried to brew a option and i rocketted through the building and fell to my death
22:31:05 <Bio> just convince them that your lord sent you on a top secret mission
22:31:08 <Camail> the jankiest
