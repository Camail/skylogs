00:03:27 <skrm> well you'd be disappointed so im gonna get a card with a festive dog-related motif instead
00:03:37 <Bio> happi birfday mr dot
00:05:14 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/reddit
00:05:21 <Dot`> you horses are great <3
00:05:42 <Dot`> why does reddit havea  twitch
00:05:58 <Camail> dot you are old, but not old enough to be angry and confused

00:06:01 <Camail> so that's a plus
00:06:02 <Bio> dot
00:06:32 <Crisium> what is this stream
00:07:11 <Dot`> this is good bio
00:08:11 <Bio> <3
00:11:00 <skrm> cam is this a part of the thanos thing thats going on
00:11:08 <Camail> yea
00:11:10 <skrm> i havent seen the movie so i have no clue what its about
00:11:23 <Camail> i read the marvel wiki but havent seen the movie
00:11:35 <Camail> so i know what's happening
00:11:38 <Dot`> ah
00:11:42 <Dot`> "A subreddit dedicated to Thanos is preparing to ban half of its users at random"
00:12:26 <Bio> this is v nerd
00:14:16 <Crisium> nerds
00:14:19 <Crisium> it was a good movie tho
00:14:54 <Dot`> .tell dub` https://imgur.com/gallery/tjkUh2S
00:24:57 <Phearlock> o shit its dots bday?
00:25:14 <Phearlock> Happy older day dot
00:25:34 <Dot`> pearclock <3
00:26:00 <Dot`> i plan to use this day to leavrage items from BioDM
00:26:13 <Phearlock> neat
00:26:24 <Dot`> we got no magic items yet
00:26:28 <Dot`> its a disgrace
00:26:57 <Phearlock> My lvl 2 conjuration ability lets me conjure an inanimate object.
00:27:03 <Phearlock> It is a magical inanimate object
00:27:14 <Phearlock> So technically I have a magic item
00:27:26 <Dot`> if i was to wizard i would probably go conjuraction
00:27:46 <Dot`> making random objects alll the time
00:28:00 <Phearlock> And making other things do the fighting for you
00:28:11 <Phearlock> eventually
00:28:14 <Dot`> also nice
00:28:23 <Dot`> tohugh you already do that
00:28:44 <Phearlock> Well, yes
00:29:49 <Phearlock> I'm going to fall asleep now. Enjoy your birthday dot. <3
00:30:13 <Dot`> gnigiht phear <3
00:30:25 <Cane> Wtf Dot` tell me it's your birthday man. <3
00:30:42 <Cane> Night Phearlock. =)
00:30:45 <Dot`> ok
00:30:49 <Dot`> cane, its my birthday
00:31:22 <Cane> It's 2:30am here. Was or is?
00:31:30 <Dot`> is
00:31:43 <Cane> Neat. Happy birthday, hope it's a good one. =)
00:31:47 <Dot`> ty <3
00:34:45 <Bio> this adv is pretty light on magic for a long while i believe
00:35:37 <Bio> but considering the types of baddies you are fighting, there are certainly possibilities to come into things 
00:35:51 <Bio> plus dub's char is essentially a magic item for the whole party
00:36:00 <Bio> opop 
00:37:58 <skrm> fuck magic though
00:38:21 <Dot`> so bets on all the magical items we find being great for dub
00:39:36 <skrm> dub LOVES magic
00:39:52 <skrm> that boi aint right i tell ya
00:40:56 <Dot`> hmm your right, i wonder how long he sticks to his "magic is evil" when confronted by a nice weapon
00:42:50 <Dot`> roll to test resolve
00:43:56 <Bio> Akhat's resolve is tested

03:57:14 <Camail> it's really annoying how momentum is ruined in this format
03:57:16 <Camail> but w/e
03:58:39 <Camail> the games are way too slow, and they need to fix that if they want 1v1 to be esports

22:26:56 <skrm> true
22:38:01 <Cane> Camail, rapha and DaHanG are both live. Stream titles suggest 2v2 scrims incoming.
22:38:27 <Camail> yea have rapha on in the background
22:38:31 <Cane> That's my favorite thing to watch right now. I think 2v2 is really dynamic.
22:38:48 <Cane> Feels the most like Quake imo.
22:39:02 <Cane> Instead of whatever Sacrifice is that id were pushing for a while.
22:40:12 <Camail> yea i dont even seen them praccing that at all
22:41:28 <Bio> Bot TI is the absolute GEM
22:42:04 <Camail> rapha made a point that i think aligns with what i've been thinking, that champion abilities are kinda volatile and you can get low skill kills in 1v1, and kills matter so much that you can have high impact plays that dont feel good, but in 2v2 you have a different format and a teammate that offsets that and makes it more skill based
22:42:37 <Camail> also momentum no longer exists in 1v1 so it almost doesn't feel like quake
22:43:11 <skrm> Bio this is better than regular TI
22:43:13 <Camail> that last bit he didnt say, it's just my thought
22:43:51 <Bio> can't wait for the top 16
22:43:56 <Bio> my boi tide tho
22:44:02 <Camail> this is how commentary would be if fighting game commentary actually explained everything that went on in a round
22:44:09 <Camail> like 95% talking
22:44:39 <Camail> i'd like to see like a bo10 or 20
22:46:22 <skrm> These bots are SO BAD, Bio 
22:46:27 <Bio> ROFL

22:48:53 <Bio> BRUTAL. SAVAGE. REKT.
23:06:09 <Camail> rapha really doesnt like the tribolt
23:07:52 <Cane> It's new and scary.
23:09:26 <Camail> i think it's better than rockets at suppressing fire but worse at everything else
23:11:31 <Camail> that steal tho
23:11:47 <Camail> that's why knowing the exact second can be so good
23:12:01 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-163-99.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
23:14:43 <Camail> we have 4 people who have quake installed
23:14:53 <Camail> wink wink
23:17:33 <skrm> i start my summer vacation next week cam
23:17:41 <skrm> we should do a bunch of quaking
23:18:03 <Camail> well, a moderate amount
23:18:10 <Camail> i'm just pushing ahrd atm because the current level is 0
23:18:34 <Camail> LMAO the eye roll at the tribolt kill
23:22:22 <Cane> We should definitely Quake it up a bit soon.
23:22:34 <Cane> Need someone to be bad with.
23:22:53 <Camail> fucking 180 telefrag
23:22:55 <Cane> LOL orb.
23:22:55 <skrm> Bio
23:22:58 <skrm> what the f u c k
23:23:00 <Cane> Wtf rapha.
23:23:04 <Bio> LOL
23:23:05 <Bio> L O L
23:23:09 <Bio> L  O  L
23:23:21 <Bio> warlock threw so hard
23:23:32 <Bio> was like our ult is so good, imma throw lvl 5
23:23:36 <skrm> FATAL B O N D S PLS
23:25:03 <Camail> i find it interesting that sometimes rapha knows entirely by feel whether or not he has enough advantage to guarantee a kill or the inverse
23:25:24 <Camail> calling the guy dead like 3 seconds before the fight ends

23:35:38 <Camail> despite intitial complaints, the facts that so many weapons are still relevant is a credit to keeping the core quake functions alive
23:46:00 <reification> night all
23:47:47 <Dot> gnight reif
23:52:46 <Cane> I always did prefer the Quake movement but the UT weapons, on the whole.
23:52:54 <Cane> If you want me giddy just give me a Shock Rifle.
