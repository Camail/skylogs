07:32:44 <DuB`> DOT
07:32:45 <DuB`> <3
07:32:50 <DuB`> I had QUITE the day
07:32:56 <Dot`> do tell
07:33:42 <DuB`> Got to leave work after lunch and meet up with all the interns at Pier 39 do a silly scavenger hunt
07:33:53 <DuB`> Then go to nearby diner+bar and get a bunch of free whatever
07:34:06 <DuB`> Had like a full pound of truffle parmesan fries
07:34:18 <DuB`> And some good 0-proof drinks
07:34:44 <DuB`> Left there, found out how to take bus over to other side of city to game shop
07:34:57 <DuB`> Stayed for friday night mtg and met cool folks
07:35:00 <DuB`> Lost all my games
07:35:27 <DuB`> Left there at 11pm and had another trek through and across the city in THE DARK and made it all the way back to san leandro without dying
07:35:49 <Dot`> dont walk through a city in the dark Dub 
07:35:54 <Dot`> they are bad places
07:35:57 <DuB`> I SCOOTERED through the city!
07:36:09 <DuB`> Only got yelled at by one drunk guy
07:36:18 <Dot`> you havea scooter now?
07:36:26 <DuB`> Just a lil' kick scooter :P
07:36:31 <Dot`> haha
07:36:33 <Dot`> nice
07:36:36 <DuB`> It IS!
07:36:44 <DuB`> Cut my commute down by a full 15 min
07:36:54 <DuB`> And is awful convenient around downtown
07:37:01 <Dot`> now attach a little electric motor
07:37:31 <DuB`> Sound like that would make it hard to carry onto bus+train which I use every day :P
07:37:32 <DuB`> Nawww
07:39:05 <Dot`> .tell skram https://imgur.com/gallery/PeDFa7R
07:39:17 <DuB`> Went 0-3 in FNM matches but won 2 games within those bo3s
07:39:18 <Dot`> did you win the scavanger hunt ?
07:39:21 <DuB`> First timer
07:39:30 <Dot`> whats a FNM?
07:39:44 <DuB`> friday night magic
07:40:11 <DuB`> Did the booster pack deck draft thingie
07:41:27 <Dot`> you now have cards the, woohoo
07:41:33 <Dot`> was it a green blue deck
07:41:36 <DuB`> Dunno if I'll go again, it was nice but soooo far 
07:41:37 <Dot`> they are best obviosly
07:41:39 <DuB`> White/blue

07:43:24 <DuB`> Have 4-5 decks in english between my and my brother, will enjoy sharing and playing those with the friends we'll be rooming with in the fall
07:43:58 <DuB`> Hopefully get some of them to build their own to really join in too
07:44:09 <DuB`> I know a few already like mtg but just haven't had much chance
07:44:11 <Dot`> Dub is trying to bankrupt ppl
07:44:28 <DuB`> Our decks are just like $30-40 ones that will be easy to match!
07:46:00 <DuB`> Also another thing that happened, when I got home my phone wouldn't turn on or charge and I thought it was permadead
07:46:09 <DuB`> That was scary, got it working though
