00:13:20 <Cane> pls
00:13:24 <Cane> It's not right
00:13:43 <Cane> I'm starting to think he's better than me Camail.
00:13:56 <Camail> i dont understand
00:15:24 <Camail> fuck, 3 rails in a row
00:15:40 <Camail> they took a bad fight tho

00:16:07 <Cane> ...
00:16:08 <Cane> I'm done.
00:16:10 <Cane> I'm fucking done.
00:16:29 <Camail> RAPHA
00:16:33 <Camail> the confidence in that voice
00:16:43 <Cane> LOL
00:16:46 <Cane> "No they're not, I got that shit."
00:17:09 <Camail> oh he jumped? k then i guess he's dead
00:17:16 <Camail> basically killed himself at that point
00:23:14 <Camail> LOL
00:23:33 <Camail> tbf if they hit him at all that wouldn't have happened
00:23:41 <Cane> lol bye rapha.
00:29:09 <Camail> rapha you lan princes
00:31:45 <Camail> ranger railed at rail
00:31:49 <Camail> the calls 
00:49:40 <Runbunny> UT had double tab dodge right?
00:53:55 <Cane> Runbunny, depends on the version.
00:54:03 <Cane> UT2K4 did. Original UT no. Current UT does again.
00:54:35 <Runbunny> double tabbing is a horrible mechanic in my opinion.
00:55:18 <Cane> I think they added it to the new UT because people kept constantly asking for it. At first they weren't going to I think, instead going back to classic style.
00:55:34 <Cane> I think at this point it's just something that differentiates it from Quake and so people like it? I dunno.
00:55:38 <Cane> It's annoying to do.
00:57:07 <Cane> The weapons are more fun in UT though. They all have alt fires that all get used, there's just more of them in general, and the Shock Rifle is the gameplay equivalent of an orgasm.
01:01:49 <Runbunny> Hehe.
01:02:02 <Camail> you're saying this to me, who is fine playing a shooter that really only has 3 guns
01:02:26 <Camail> gun variety has never been on my checklist of things i care about
01:02:36 <Camail> but i can see why it would be
01:06:08 <Camail> oh wow sacrifice isnt even at quake con?
01:06:47 <Camail> that's pretty damning, and it sucks for the devs...but it was way too ambitious
01:10:52 <Cane> I'm not sure I'm too sympathetic. It felt like a pretty blatant push to make Quake an objective based 4v4 hero shooter to capitalize on all the other games doing it, as opposed to because they thought it was a really good fit for the game.
01:12:58 <Camail> yea but they clearly this game started as a quake moba, and sacrifice was the plan from the beginning, the question is where that motivation came from.  what it the devs or the publishers
01:13:54 <Camail> my guess is the publishers, because devs are usually passionate gamers who understand things like that
01:14:12 <Camail> game dev sucks to get into unless you love games, so i always give them the benefit of the doubt
01:14:17 <Cane> I'm guessing publishers. That's the sort of thing that's decided by people who look at current trends.
01:15:01 <Camail> so the devs probably pitched it thinking they could stay true to quake mechanics but then lay the moba over it
01:15:16 <Camail> turns out they were wrong, and that's really hard to see from the inside
01:16:33 <Cane> It's unfortunate that it was an awful mess, because if they'd pulled it off it would have had huge casual appeal.
01:17:14 <Camail> hell, it might still be a good casual mode
01:17:27 <Camail> sadly i think 4v4 doesnt works on any of the maps
01:17:34 <Cane> I do think 2v2 has potential in that regard. Bring your best mate and have fun together.
01:17:39 <Camail> but sacrifice could be like what payload was for tf2
01:17:40 <Cane> That's the problem. The maps were just terrible for it.
01:17:55 <Cane> That mechanic, on those maps, was messy and busy and awful to watch.
01:17:57 <Camail> everyone loves payload on 32 man servers
01:18:35 <Camail> yea 4v4 feels really cramped, but its unranked so you kinda have to brush it off
01:18:41 <Cane> Everybody join my 32 pop Dustbowl server. Take a break from 32 pop 2fort.
01:19:28 <Camail> nah 32 gold rush
01:19:31 <Camail> talk about aids
01:19:45 <Camail> all of them were garbage tho
01:20:01 <Camail> like i dont get why ppl liked that
01:20:20 <Camail> i would always go into a server and dominate until it hit about 14v14
01:20:29 <Camail> 24 pop was the best pub stuff
01:20:44 <Cane> "I'm conceding it. Aaaah... fuck it." Invis, steal.
01:20:52 <Camail> lul
01:21:09 <Cane> Yeah I'm with you, 24 player servers were great.
01:21:39 <Cane> 12 players on a team meant that usually you could play what you wanted and not care.
01:21:56 <Cane> And there were plenty of targets.
01:22:16 <Camail> and choke points weren't as normandy-esque
01:23:01 <Cane> lol that's a pretty good word for it.
01:23:03 <Camail> oh hey there's 2 chokepoints, one of them has 12 people spamming the other has you doing a 1v4 because your teams REALLY believes it can break trough up there
01:23:28 <Camail> dustbowl 3 was terrrrrrible
01:23:41 <Cane> So many of those maps were aids.
01:26:49 <Cane> Is Doomguy any good? This is the first time I've seen Rapha/DaHanG play him.
01:28:22 <Camail> yea he's used quite a bit
01:28:32 <Camail> because doing double damage with lg is nice
01:28:49 <Camail> their opponents use him way more often
01:29:03 <Camail> the double jump is nice, too
01:29:43 <Camail> especially on this map, it looks like having doom guy on tribolt just lets you control heavy and rail pretty easily
01:29:48 <Cane> Wait what? Double damage?
01:29:53 <Camail> well, you get two guns
01:29:54 <Cane> Are you talking about BJ? Doom Guy has Berserk.
01:30:04 <Camail> oh duh
01:30:16 <Cane> Berserk looks awful.
01:30:18 <Camail> um yea he's used occasionally, not as much as bj
01:30:26 <Camail> i get them confused because they are basically the same character
01:30:45 <Camail> berserk is kinda ass, yea
01:31:13 <Camail> seems mostly useful with the double jump, a mix between tanky 100 armor and a double jump
01:31:40 <Camail> but if you use it just right is basically just a free kill, still not great tho

03:28:17 <Camail> so the latter
03:28:27 <Camail> that's happened to me if i really like the game
03:28:46 <Camail> because when i want to play it i feel bad because then i wont be able to play it again

19:26:08 <Zounds> I'm currently doing darkmoon stuff but as much as I'd like to be defending some poor host from a nasty red what I'm usually doing is joining the 4 man gangbang on him
19:26:59 <Zounds> Nobody who actually needs the help has the blue covenant on
19:29:08 <Zounds> They should bring back the blue eye orb :P

20:04:21 <Dot> cane, how is rael doing?
20:05:43 <Cane> I only talk to him for ~10 minutes a day right now. I think he's just busy trying not to go insane with boredom. Otherwise ok.
20:11:35 <Dot> he has so much reading time!
20:19:48 <Cane> Yeah, I hope he's allowed to stare at words all day.
20:19:56 <Cane> No TV or games though, I know that.

20:52:20 <Phearlock> Been messing with it again the past 2 months
20:52:21 <Phearlock> is fun
20:53:08 <Phearlock> Good for me and my poor reactions as it's really hard to die instantly as long as you're not stupid about positioning
20:54:18 <Cane> Them's quittin' words. Old man or not, I'm all about that Quake.

21:32:29 <Dot> RIP
21:32:40 <Dot> now everyone here will be moody tomorow
22:03:34 <Camail> i am here, ready to quake with excitement
22:03:55 <Camail> i wish nioh's co-op was more reliable/frequent
22:04:58 <Camail> it's kinda rough in general tho because it's so easy to die so quickly and BAM all that time waiting is no ruined cuz your host didnt have the right ninja scrolls and forgot to roll forward once
