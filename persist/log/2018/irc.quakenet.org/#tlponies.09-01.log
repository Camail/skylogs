05:44:39 <Camail> ok i am mad
05:44:45 <Camail> oooook fuck this game god damn
05:44:48 <DuB`> :o
05:45:10 <Camail> i got a fucking bug that killed a main NPC but it only happens 40 hours afterwards
05:45:22 <Camail> oh boy oh boy this is a fun kind of rage
05:45:25 <DuB`> O_o
05:45:26 <DuB`> Wha game
05:45:32 <Camail> divinity 2
05:45:41 <DuB`> Aha
05:45:45 <DuB`> Can you console command it?
05:45:52 <Camail> i did every source empowerment quest, and the game bugged and thought i did NONE of them
05:45:58 <DuB`> I had to do a couple of things in 1
05:46:16 <Camail> i would have to manually change a flag in the story
05:46:22 <Camail> i have no idea how i would do that
05:46:41 <Camail> i did TOO WELL
05:49:45 <Camail> woooooooo that just murdered this game for me
05:49:53 <DuB`> :(
05:49:55 <Camail> i love being punished in mission critical ways for no reason
05:50:10 <Camail> this is a rocking-in-my-chair kind of anger
