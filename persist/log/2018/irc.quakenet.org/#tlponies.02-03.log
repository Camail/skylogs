01:48:37 <Dot`> New DnD book announced
01:48:49 <Dot`> https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/7uucx4/everything_we_know_about_mordenkainens_tome_of/
01:59:23 <DuB`> wat is
02:00:04 <Dot`> wat
02:03:06 <DuB`> Just wasnt' sure what the book was
02:04:04 <Bio> a dnd book of things
02:06:07 <Camail> DuB`  here's a mhw streamer using insect glaive https://www.twitch.tv/snake
02:07:27 <DuB`> Ooooh
02:08:11 <DuB`> Will watch a bit, gonna do like you mentioned and not watch TOO much though with it being something I may eventually play
02:08:13 <DuB`> mebbe mebbe
02:09:26 <Camail> yea but I am weak
02:09:37 <Camail> i'm not watching any of the grinding guys
02:09:48 <Camail> these guys have gone so slow I've barely even seen anything
02:10:02 <Camail> but seeing all the different weapons helps me decide what i would want
02:10:25 <Camail> i dont want to use dual blades or hammer, those are the two ends of the spectrum
02:10:33 <Camail> i wanna use something in between, and glaive looks funky
02:14:57 <DuB`> You decide on the console play or whatever?
02:16:46 <DuB`> I totally forgot we have an xbox1 here because my brother hasn't used it in ages lol
02:21:39 <Crisium> like my ps4 iv turned on twice in the past year
02:21:47 <Crisium> PC too OP
02:21:51 <DuB`> Haha
02:29:59 <Crisium> honestly a waste of money hehe
02:30:00 <Crisium> oh well
02:30:10 <Crisium> Nioh was fun
02:30:20 <Crisium> tho its on PC now
02:30:40 <skram> what a boat horizon new dawn
02:33:37 <Bio> ASDF
02:33:42 <Crisium> havent played
02:33:44 <Crisium> looks good tho
02:36:30 <skram> ashly burch is in it
02:36:33 <skram> she's my favorite
02:37:35 <Crisium> yeah she good
02:48:10 <Camail> it would be too mcuh of a hassle to go to chicago every time i wanted to play mhw
02:48:27 <Camail> and its the kind of game you play in 5 hour chunks, which doesnt work for that scenario
02:49:13 <Camail> i do wanna get ff15, and it has something similar
02:49:21 <Camail> ff15 comrades?  i think its called that
03:25:17 <Crisium> this snipe https://clips.twitch.tv/ResoluteUgliestCormorantVoHiYo
