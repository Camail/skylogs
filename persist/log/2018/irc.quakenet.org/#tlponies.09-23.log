00:05:22 <Dot`> skram
00:05:35 <skram> yass
00:05:54 <Dot`> just did a Tarkov raid and made it out with so much loot
00:05:56 <Dot`> it was great
00:07:02 <DuB`> :D
00:07:18 <DuB`> Mebbe I should get tarkov so I can play a shootygame with dot
00:07:36 <Dot`> do you like losing all your hard earned stuff and being sad?
00:07:58 <skram> hell yeah
00:08:02 <skram> sounds perfect
00:08:35 <Bio> pew pew
00:09:50 <Dot`> i got a fully modded M4
00:09:56 <Dot`> im playing with the big boys now
00:10:01 <Dot`> till i die and lose it
00:10:13 <Dot`> becuase im nowhere near high enough level with traders to buy it
00:12:41 <DuB`> .choose pizza mexican
00:12:45 <DuB`> YESSIR
00:13:18 <Dot`> good swoots
00:15:49 <Bio> mexican pizza
00:25:06 <Dot`> so smart
00:26:07 <Dot`> Dub, if your intrested in a complex and hard FPS game Tarkov is definatly what i recomend
00:26:29 <Dot`> though your only other option is Arma i tihnk and thats far slower paced and even more buggy
00:34:34 <Dot`> warhorses are strong bio
00:35:00 <Cane> Dot`, can there be an Arma game that runs well please?
00:35:19 <Dot`> cane, please be serious
00:35:25 <Cane> A mostly bug-free Arma with quality performance that lets you get more than 40fps.
00:35:36 <Cane> I would play that so hard.
00:35:52 <Cane> Maybe they could make ArmStalker on that too.
00:36:10 <Dot`> but honestly Tarkov is less buggy than most AAA titles on release
00:36:21 <Dot`> but certainly not bug free
00:37:19 <Dot`> had a few crashes, but the reconnect feature works, and havnt managed to glitch into anytihng and get stuck yet
00:37:45 <Dot`> there is a very funny issue with FoV
00:37:56 <Dot`> it effects some guns scope aiming hight
00:51:31 <Dot`> dub, what pizza you get?
00:53:00 <skram> probably some weird fruity variety
00:53:27 <Bio> the werst
00:53:42 <Dot`> like apple and peaches
00:57:35 <DuB`> Got their Everything Pizza
00:58:02 <DuB`> Sausage pep ham olive pineapple pepper onion etc
00:58:11 <Dot`> sounds nice
00:58:23 <DuB`> Ye
00:58:31 <DuB`> Might buy game next weekend, dot
00:58:38 <DuB`> Tests and interviews this week
00:58:49 <Cane> Camail, you watching?
00:58:50 <Cane> This is a comeback.
00:58:52 <Dot`> yes, you will get all 4 jobs
00:58:53 <Dot`> easy
01:33:00 <Bio> neigh
01:33:07 <Bio> the chili i made was super gud
01:33:21 <Bio> and i have meals left over for next week
01:33:25 <Bio> ez

02:13:31 <DuB`> No skram I only need 4 jobs or so

14:04:14 <carcinization> oh that's useful. gj sweetie
14:04:29 <Crisium> lol what is this reddit thread
14:05:35 <carcinization> thread is standard mercy complaints, you should only read the linked comment
14:05:56 <Crisium> as a support main, mercy is still my highest winrate this reason actually
14:06:04 <Crisium> i dont play her as much, just when she seems best
14:06:15 <carcinization> you are unusual then cris
14:06:16 <Crisium> basically if team needs a pocket or high moblity healer
14:06:26 <carcinization> her winrate has gotten pretty bad
14:06:31 <Crisium> i play Ana more overall tho
14:06:38 <carcinization> skram phear https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/9i7d9d/detailed_space_shuttle_launch_made_out_of_lego/
14:06:42 <Crisium> its because ppl try to play Mercy in every situation
14:06:53 <Crisium> with her reduced healing she is more situational
14:07:11 <carcinization> i am playing ana which is a certain sign that ana is strong compared to mercy/moira
14:07:23 <Crisium> Ana is strongest right now for sure
