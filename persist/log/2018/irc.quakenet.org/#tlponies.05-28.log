02:57:24 <Camail> dbfz is fucking exhausting to watch
02:58:47 <Bio> there sure is a lot going on
02:59:40 <Camail> mostly how long each game is
02:59:59 <Camail> like god damn
03:00:12 <Bio> haha
03:00:12 <Camail> making my eyes run a marathon
03:00:19 <Bio> i love how they move like 2 inches and theres this giant dust storm
03:00:23 <Camail> and then having to agonize over sonic fox
03:01:21 <Bio> tasty steve sure has a bunch of bracelets
03:01:33 <Camail> time for the team kill
03:01:35 <Camail> rip dogura
03:01:47 <Camail> that's his aesthetic bio
03:01:55 <Camail> he looks weird without them
03:02:23 <Bio> i can respect the aesthetic
03:02:44 <Bio> also yeh, 300 second round timer?
03:02:45 <Bio> gebus
03:02:51 <Bio> what was MVC's timer
03:03:17 <Camail> well, seconds are never real seconds in any fighting game
03:03:29 <Camail> but certainly matches typically went way quicker
03:03:47 <Bio> gotta have more time
03:03:54 <Camail> so much so that the entire tournament was ft3
03:03:56 <Bio> so the supers cutscenes can play
03:04:06 <Camail> time stops during cinematics
03:04:12 <Camail> well
03:04:14 <Camail> nvm
03:04:18 <Camail> only some games and some supers
03:05:03 <Camail> but still, fighting games almost literally never time out, mvc3 had really high damaging combos and crazy set ups so momentum made matches really quick
03:05:13 <Bio> it seems like they were certainly going for a super distilled dragonball episode with this game
03:05:23 <Camail> even in this game, where you have 4 offensive mechanics for every 1 defensive mechanic, it somehow takes longer
03:05:44 <Camail> it's mostly because a lot of the damage you do is recoverable
03:05:53 <Camail> and the heavy damaging supers are 100% recoverable
03:06:08 <Camail> so the total amount of damage you have to do is obscene
03:06:37 <Camail> unless you do short combos that dont end in super, which just emans you do less damage and the virtual hp of the teams is still really high
03:06:59 <Camail> like
03:07:03 <Camail> this is still fucking game 1
03:07:16 <Camail> since we started talking, a marvel set could be done
03:08:00 <Bio> lol
03:08:05 <Bio> the guy LOOKS pained
03:09:23 <Camail> go1 is still the favorite in this match, even at 0-1
03:12:48 <Camail> fuck, i cant take a rematch
03:13:03 <Camail> also if you're confused, go1 is go-ichi
03:13:07 <Camail> cuz ya know, japan
03:13:22 <Bio> cause japan.
03:13:49 <Bio> these guys need to throw more people into mountains immo
03:40:13 <Camail> ok it's time
03:43:10 <Camail> oh also sparking recovering so much health, that makes matches last ages too
03:45:02 <Bio> sparking is basically xfactor yeh?
03:48:29 <Camail> yea
04:01:22 <Camail> also assists are so protected its impossible to get two characters killed in the same combo
04:01:37 <Camail> they flip out of juggles immediately
04:04:48 <Camail> SAJAM
04:04:50 <Camail> ITS BUMP SET SPIKE
04:04:51 <Camail> FUCK
04:04:55 <Camail> SAY IT RIGHT
04:05:05 <Camail> gotenks is even doing the moves right

16:33:13 <Zounds> and they are good guys

16:34:04 <skram> Ah, I dont have much interaction with people at my job

20:14:26 <Camail> i might, once I'm done shitting around on the internet
20:30:14 <Runbunny> I don't like the OP to megalo box Camail. It's kinda bad in my opinion.
20:30:32 <Camail> honestly i haven't watched an op in years
20:30:35 <Camail> i always skip them
20:30:49 <Runbunny> I usually watch it at least once.
20:30:57 <Camail> but yea its actually really uninspiring
20:31:08 <Camail> the thing is, the show is slow as fuck, and they made their op slow as fuck too
20:31:16 <Camail> which doesnt fit with what people expect from an op
20:31:39 <Runbunny> indeed. 
20:31:40 <Camail> so there isn't a lot going on, it's really trying to drive home a single concept for like 60 seconds
20:31:57 <Camail> which has value artistically, but idc?
20:32:30 <Runbunny> Yeah, it needed more of a banger.
20:32:54 <Camail> eh, i'm fine with it, i dont think they put any money in it
20:32:56 <Camail> which i prefer
20:33:04 <Camail> putting money into the op is a waste of time,imo
20:33:19 <Camail> i want that in an episode, even if it makes one episode just a little better
20:33:53 <Camail> and they REALLY focus on the episodes, i haven't timed it but i think cutting out the op and ed, the episodes are longer than usual
20:34:06 <Camail> especially looking at something like hero academia
20:35:42 <Bio> GGS
20:35:47 <Bio> i guess
20:40:27 <DuB`> Lina went a bit better
20:54:56 <Camail> uh oh, you dota'd
20:55:08 <Camail> didnt we tell you that was dangerous
20:55:19 <DuB`> Not so dangerous, more pointless :P
20:56:06 <Camail> pointlessness leads to meaninglessness, which leads to existentialism
20:56:06 <Runbunny> Oh noes Dub.
20:56:15 <Camail> dont be an existentialist dub
20:56:22 <Camail> be better
21:12:36 <carcinisation> you can't escape the radical freedom cam
21:14:12 <Camail> BE BETTER
21:14:28 <carcinisation> you can always make terrible mistakes like watching anime
21:15:50 <Zounds> wouldn't that depend on the one you watch
21:15:59 <Camail> continentalist philosophy is all garbage and no one can convince me otherwise
21:16:07 <Camail> all anime is a mistake zounds
21:16:18 <Zounds> I hear that a lot but I'm not convinced
21:16:28 <Camail> it's ok to make mistakes tho
21:16:52 <Camail> well all anime other than your favorite anime
21:17:11 <Camail> aka best anime, aka samurai champloo
21:18:53 <Camail> alright, i am prepared to fight on a side of a planet
21:18:59 <Camail> which planet? which side? who knows
21:19:09 <Zounds> Auraxis
21:19:12 <Zounds> is the planet
21:19:21 <Zounds> in ps2
21:19:22 <Phearlock> But the right or left side of auraxis?
21:19:41 <Zounds> In planetside 1 auraxis blew up into many smaller planets
21:19:42 <Camail> the top? bottom? sub? dom?
21:19:55 <Camail> so many questions
21:20:00 <Zounds> but they retconned that because it was dumb and everyone thought it was silly
21:20:13 <Camail> its easy to do when lore doesnt matter
21:20:33 <Zounds> I liked planetside lore in ps1
21:20:42 <Zounds> they did good write up and in game explanations for patches
21:20:55 <Zounds> but that requires having a soul which game devs do not have these days =P
21:25:00 <Camail> Zounds  when you are in the weapon selection screen, what are those medals in the bottom right corner of the weapon
21:25:08 <Camail> below the "x kills to next medal"
21:25:22 <Camail> i know the ribbons + medals are essentially kill counts
21:25:28 <Zounds> oh just things that give you some certs when you attain them
21:25:40 <Zounds> 10 for bronze 60 for silver 160 for gold 1160 for auraxium
21:25:47 <Zounds> kills that is
21:26:09 <Zounds> you can complete directive and get special weapons for getting 5 auraxiums in a class of weapons
21:26:19 <Zounds> like the Betelgeuse if you aruaxium 5 LMG for example
21:26:35 <Zounds> It's an Orion without a forward grip but uses a heat mechanic instead of ammo
21:27:16 <Camail> no not those, there's another thing below my smg
21:27:50 <Camail> like the little neon outline for the badges is for killcount, right?
21:27:53 <Camail> thats what i saw on the wiki
21:27:58 <Camail> but there is another thing
21:28:47 <Zounds> For some reason I have no idea what you're talking about >.<
21:28:56 <Zounds> All I see is a ribbon count
21:29:30 <Camail> https://imgur.com/a/ZfRGEJB
21:29:47 <Camail> and before i selected it it had a x 16 next to it
21:30:00 <Camail> i know the golden outline is for th ekill count medal
21:30:21 <Zounds> oh yeah that is just the ribbon count

23:02:08 <Camail> that's basically a win
23:02:49 <DuB`> I just don't understand PS2
23:03:03 <DuB`> I got to play for 15 minutes then it kicked me out and now I can't deploy anywhere?
23:03:23 <Runbunny> Continent locked?
23:03:43 <DuB`> No
23:04:02 <Zounds> kicked you out how?
23:04:04 <DuB`> Amerish is not locked, but it keeps sending me to Koltyr where there are 0 people from any faction and there's nothing to do
23:04:53 <Zounds> Are you playing the most populated faction?
23:05:12 <DuB`> No clue
23:06:00 <Zounds> Koltyr is pretty much a live fire training area
23:06:12 <Zounds> usually get put there if your faction has too much pop on the continents
23:06:52 <Runbunny> Go somewhere else Dub!
23:06:54 <Runbunny> Quick!
23:07:01 <DuB`> ???
23:07:03 <DuB`> To overwatch??
23:07:07 <Runbunny> no no
23:07:13 <Runbunny> Continent.
23:07:17 <DuB`> I can't!
23:07:24 <DuB`> I think I'll go to overwatch instead!
23:07:58 <Runbunny> Sure you can. but you have to use the console thingy with the globe or whatever.
23:08:24 <DuB`> Oh, found the queue thing finally
23:08:26 <DuB`> 25min
23:08:27 <DuB`> lolno
23:08:35 <Runbunny> :D
23:08:56 <Zounds> Well it's either that or the other factions get overrun by overpopulated shitters
23:08:57 <DuB`> This game doen't want me to play it
23:09:16 <DuB`> Get -10fps per person within 50m of me too lol

23:11:45 <Camail> dub turn down graphics and fps shouldnt be too abd
23:11:55 <Camail> your computer is decent, should probably get 60 fps even in big fights
23:11:56 <Zounds> He's tried that
23:12:02 <Zounds> He just has a cursed install or something
23:12:10 <DuB`> At very low and 75% render

23:12:34 <carcinisation> g'night all

23:12:40 <Dot> gnight reif
23:12:45 <Camail> I'm at 100% render and medium in most things and get 45 fps in big fights
23:12:49 <Dot> how are you doing now skrm
23:13:01 <Camail> you said your pc is cpu bottlenecked, do you have a bad cpu?
23:13:05 <Camail> or just an average one
23:13:15 <DuB`> It goes up to 120fps when I'm in the middle of nowhere
23:13:37 <Camail> because if graphics changes didnt matter it might be cpu?
23:13:39 <DuB`> 40ish in the fight I was in, dunno if it was big, but with random spikes to <20
23:13:49 <Camail> eh, that's normal-ish
23:13:59 <Camail> 40's is fine in ps2
23:14:03 <DuB`> On very low at 75%
23:14:04 <Zounds> well that depends on the size of the fight
23:14:15 <Zounds> you shouldn't be getting such low fps unless it's 96+
23:14:31 <Camail> did you turn v sync off
23:14:48 <DuB`> Think so
23:15:14 <Runbunny> Uninstall windows and throw computer out the window.
