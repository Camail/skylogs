00:03:47 <Dot> i am the worst at Hoarder simulator
00:04:01 <Dot> was just going in with hatchet every raid
00:04:12 <Dot> ran into a few glitchers
00:09:11 <Dot> dub, you slay the tower yet?
00:16:52 <Zounds> what's the deal with tarkov Dot 
00:17:00 <Zounds> is it player versus player?
00:17:03 <Zounds> or is it vs AI?
00:17:09 <Zounds> or both?
00:17:42 <Dot> both
00:21:29 <Dot> i shall try explain Tarkov 
00:22:53 <Dot> hardcore FPS with a drive towards realism, so for instance you can check your mag and get told, "about half left", gun modding is insanenly detailed and realistic
00:23:22 <Dot> your main character, PMC (para military contracotr), gains levels and skills, and has a stash
00:23:40 <Dot> you eqiup him with stuff you have or trade with at the 5 traders
00:23:57 <Dot> then enter a Raid on one of currently 5 maps
00:24:25 <Dot> depending on the map a number of other PMC's also start at the same time
00:24:48 <Dot> so you loot, kill, and try extract with stuff to sell and keep for use
00:25:32 <Dot> the plan to my knowledge is it will eventually be a STALKER style free romaing map
00:26:17 <Dot> you can also go in as a Skav, which gives you a random loadout of really bad equipment
00:26:37 <Dot> any gear you get out with you keep but any experience gained or missions done dont count
00:27:10 <Dot> there are random AI spawns of Skavs on the maps
00:32:09 <Zounds> I see
00:32:56 <Dot> it has a feeling of a smoother Arma
00:37:46 <Zounds> I hope they fulfil their vision
00:38:04 <Zounds> STALKER style free roam would be great
00:38:28 <Dot> honestly it feels more complete than a lot of released triple A games already
00:39:04 <Dot> there is 5 complete maps, a lot of guns with full real life accurate modding, levels, skills, traders
00:39:35 <Dot> i look at battlefields realeses and it hasnt never had that much
00:40:22 <Zounds> yeah...
00:40:32 <Zounds> you gonna bother with Battlefiel V you think Dot ?
00:40:49 <Dot> i played the open beta and it was really fun
00:40:54 <Dot> i do like Battlefield
00:41:11 <Dot> BF1 was god aweful, but otherwise ive genrally had a lot of fun with them
00:41:26 <Zounds> I always end up getting them but I never end up enjoying any of them u_u it's peer pressure at its worst
00:41:30 <Zounds> except bad company 2
00:41:47 <Dot> i dont play them solo really
00:41:53 <Zounds> Me neither
00:42:09 <Dot> most of my friends i still game with from SA all play battlefield
00:42:29 <Dot> so i suppose its morea social thing at this point
00:42:32 <Zounds> Super popular around there right?
00:42:50 <Dot> well a lot of games dont bother with SA svrs
00:42:58 <Dot> and your looking at 200 ping to EU
00:43:02 <Dot> and thats the closes
00:43:07 <Dot> closest
00:43:33 <Zounds> Battlefield just does very little for me personally
00:43:38 <Zounds> Looks beautiful, sounds great
00:44:20 <Zounds> I will give it that
00:44:34 <Zounds> But then I can't see a guy 5 feet infront of me because of all the visual clutter and effects
00:44:50 <Dot> i plan to give bf5 a few months to get itself sorted after release
00:45:01 <Dot> and then judge how i feel
00:45:24 <Zounds> I was initially excited about the setting since I did love 1942
00:45:42 <Dot> WW2 is my favourite setting
00:45:44 <Zounds> But a big part of that is taken away with the custom uniforms and stuff
00:45:47 <Dot> after STALKER of course
00:46:46 <Zounds> Is BF5 going the same route with factions using the same guns?
00:47:21 <Dot> in the beta it was thee case, and it was the main thing that urked me
00:47:36 <Dot> i am hoping it was just that they only had like 8 guns in the beta
00:47:37 <Zounds> I always liked in 1942 how the germans used Stg44 and MP40 and americans used BAR / Springfields(?)
00:48:08 <Dot> and that on release it would be sorted
00:48:18 <Zounds> Though ofc for a long time the japanese also used Stg44 and MP40 but they did end up fixing that eventually
00:48:21 <Dot> but yea, i hope each side has its own guns
00:48:30 <Zounds> Gave them those Type guns I never remember the correct designation of
00:49:52 <Zounds> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELFxB-tGhE
00:50:10 <Zounds> This game made me enjoy the WW2 setting a lot
00:50:31 <Dot> they where great
00:50:41 <Zounds> Ah that theme
00:50:44 <Zounds> almost puts a tear in my eye
00:51:24 <Zounds> If BF5 can capture some of that heroic feeling it will be good
00:51:36 <Zounds> Unlikely for modern battlefield imo =P
00:51:42 <Dot> yea haha
00:52:15 <Dot> BF1 i played for a few hours, and twice in that time, i really felt the gritty trench warfare WW! style
00:52:17 <Dot> that was it
00:52:25 <Dot> the rest was just boring
00:52:32 <Zounds> All I remembr is being bored and annoyed by the gas grenade spam
00:52:33 <Dot> and stupidly OP tanks
00:52:54 <Zounds> I quit before anyone unlocked the mortars and stuff so I dodged that dose of AIDS
00:53:10 <Dot> lol
00:54:13 <Zounds> WW2 Online, MoH Allied Assault, BF1942
00:54:18 <Zounds> Some damn good WW2 games out there
00:54:46 <Zounds> Even on console. Medal of Honor Rising Sun was good
00:55:24 <Dot> allied assualt, breakthrough and pacific assault are the ones i recall
00:55:39 <Zounds> Ah take me back Dot 
00:55:43 <Zounds> i'm feeling nostalgic!
00:56:16 <Zounds> WW2 online was a fantastic game
00:56:21 <Zounds> An early MMOFPS
00:56:33 <Dot> i was probably still on dial up then
00:56:38 <Zounds> I think I was too
00:57:19 <Zounds> I still vividly remember shooting down a Hurricane with my light AA gun
00:57:43 <Zounds> The game was on the realistic side so AA was mostly filling the sky with shots to hit something in mass
00:57:52 <Dot> nice
00:57:52 <Zounds> But I saw that shot hit and confirm the wing come off
00:58:38 <Zounds> Was a nice thing in the game you didn't know if you hit or killed anyone untill you died or finished your mission
00:58:54 <Zounds> So there was that hesitance and confusion during gunfights. pretty good
00:59:26 <Zounds> Though ofc if you actually saw the guy go down you knew it too but that is easier said than done heh
00:59:45 <Dot> yea games liek PUBG with the massive blood spray nowdays
00:59:53 <Dot> and points showing up when you kill someone
00:59:59 <Dot> so you know they are dead
01:00:14 <Zounds> wow WW2 online is still going
01:00:51 <Dot> im consistantly suprised by games that still have active online communites
01:01:30 <Dot> i saw about 2 years ago Ground Control had a functioning online community
01:01:55 <Dot> and today i watched a Company of Heroes 2 pretty large tourney
01:03:17 <Zounds> ah that game is good
01:04:00 <Zounds> do you have it? we should play sometimes ^^
01:05:48 <Dot> i do, my brother and I use to play it
01:06:04 <Dot> im really bad, but yea, we should play sometime
01:07:02 <Zounds> Aye I only really know the basics myself
01:07:17 <Zounds> we will 2vAI or something if we do
01:07:26 <Dot> sounds good
01:07:46 <Dot> british have been released since i played
01:07:54 <Dot> i may have to get them D:
01:08:01 <Dot> british was my favourite team in 1
01:08:12 <Dot> 17 pounders where fun
01:09:30 <Zounds> indeed
01:09:50 <Zounds> Ah I should be getting to bed
01:10:04 <Dot> gnight zounds <3
01:10:06 <Zounds> Ill probably end up watching through band of brothers tomorrow after all this WW2 media talk
01:10:48 <Zounds> night!
01:52:52 <Bio> its
01:52:57 <Bio> time for the slep
01:53:05 <BioSleep> nnnnnn horselords
