18:46:51 <Zounds> Bio: aren't you guys losing undercity
18:47:01 <Bio> pft
18:47:03 <Bio> not YET
18:47:11 <Bio> but yes
18:47:29 <Zounds> I doubt anyone will care much on the horde though
18:47:30 <Bio> the alliance can have our toxic hole in the ground ayy
18:47:35 <Zounds> you're all blood elves anyway
18:47:46 <Zounds> 40% last I checked
18:47:52 <Bio> something like that
18:48:01 <Bio> we did get some new elves tho
18:48:06 <skram> eew
18:48:06 <Bio> they are p neat
18:48:24 <Bio> nightborne, probably the best story the wow team has written in a while
18:48:32 <Zounds> Yeah but don't go on with this "Lok'"tar" shite
18:48:41 <Zounds> That isn't the horde anymore
18:48:57 <Bio> haha, it arguably is more so now
18:49:02 <Bio> victory at all cost
18:49:03 <Bio> or death
18:49:15 <Bio> luckily
18:49:28 <Bio> even the second option is fine now, with our glorious banshee leader
18:49:44 <skram> sylvanas is the literal worst
18:50:00 <Bio> this is a point, skram
18:50:01 <Zounds> Yah, I think you're the first person out of deviant art who actually likes her
18:50:09 <Bio> but have you thought this?
18:50:13 <Bio> no u
18:50:25 <Bio> bruh, i play forsaken
18:50:26 <skram> whats jaina up to these daysd
18:50:39 <Bio> i'm literally indebted to her
18:50:42 <Zounds> Singing haunting sea shanties
18:50:49 <Bio> that
18:50:52 <skram> have you thought about not doing that
18:50:55 <skram> well yes
18:51:06 <skram> i read the book
18:51:14 <skram> she went to rehab
18:51:40 <Bio> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BGhzaFoYk4
18:51:47 <Zounds> I thought the forsaken were cool once
18:51:52 <Zounds> for about 30 mins during WotLK
18:51:58 <Bio> bask in the glorious shades of grey
18:52:01 <Zounds> #putressdidothingwrong
18:52:14 <skram> you're both awful
18:52:19 <Bio> xDDDDDDDD
18:52:53 <Zounds> I play Worgen so I do relate to the forsaken a bit
18:53:01 <Zounds> My leader is full of angst and is also quite handsome
18:53:12 <Bio> arthas lookin mighty great in that there vid
18:53:44 <Phearlock> "Oh no we're undead"
18:53:48 <Phearlock> "Oh no we're furries"
18:53:57 <Phearlock> I guess they're similar
18:56:18 <skram> i miss ironforge
18:56:32 <Zounds> Don't you play troll skram
18:56:39 <skram> not anymore
18:56:40 <Bio> idc what people say, i fuckin love being forsaken
18:56:44 <skram> i think
18:57:03 <Camail> forsaken is where tryhards naturally colelcted
18:57:18 <Zounds> They're all belves now
18:57:26 <Zounds> Since the racial was too good for mythic+
18:57:38 <skram> naw, tryhards were all trolls because they had the better racial
18:57:45 <Bio> well, the nerf to belf racial will mabey racechange now
18:57:49 <Camail> skram...wotf was the BEST
18:58:00 <Camail> unquestionably the best
18:58:09 <Zounds> For PvP
18:58:12 <skram> ..wotf? :p
18:58:15 <Zounds> berserking for PvE
18:58:42 <skram> oh ya
18:58:44 <skram> will of the forsaken
18:58:46 <skram> tru dat
18:58:51 <Camail> you dont need racial imbalance for pve
18:59:11 <skram> tryharding pvp in wow was always shit though
18:59:24 <Zounds> Alliance always kinda had shit pve racials
18:59:27 <Zounds> our pvp ones have been alright
18:59:34 <Zounds> escape artist was really good back in the day
18:59:47 <skram> naw
18:59:49 <Zounds> every man for himself was really OP for a while
18:59:52 <skram> dorf priests had fear ward
18:59:56 <skram> which was essential for alliance
19:00:13 <Zounds> Well if we're talking vanilla then alliance was laughing
19:00:22 <Zounds> Blessing of salvation and fear ward
19:00:30 <skram> yepp
19:00:36 <skram> well you had grounding totems :P
19:00:55 <Camail> i really enjoyed having the paladin and shaman split
19:01:02 <Zounds> windfury totems were good
19:01:45 <skram> eh paladins were better in most every way in pve
19:01:55 <skram> blessings and auras
19:03:24 <Zounds> tryharding wow pvp wasn't always shit though skram
19:03:27 <Zounds> its had its moments
19:04:11 <skram> eh it would depend
19:04:53 <Zounds> Not too many worgen in high level pvp though :(
19:04:57 <skram> you really needed a premade for BGs and before crossrealm BGs you might not meet another premade for hours and you'd just eat some randoms alive
19:04:59 <Zounds> I think i've been the highest in EU a couple times
19:05:26 <skram> got better after crossrealm was a thing but still
19:05:40 <skram> rank progression in vanilla was the grindiest
19:05:45 <Zounds> yah it was shit
19:05:56 <Zounds> I was thinking more rated BGs and arena
19:06:07 <skram> Arena was... pom pyro bullshit or whatever the flavour of the month was
19:06:24 <Zounds> RPM! flavour of the decade
19:06:31 <Zounds> Rogue, Priest, Mage if you're wondering
19:06:37 <skram> i remember :P
19:06:55 <skram> disco priest + mage in wotlk was alright
19:07:00 <skram> though we never did go hard
19:07:30 <Zounds> yeah, priest has had pretty good history in arena
19:07:46 <Zounds> some bad times but overall usually at least 1 spec is good
19:08:03 <skram> tru
19:08:16 <skram> was never able to do well with shadow specc
19:08:17 <Zounds> Even that short time in Legion with 2x Spriest and Resto shaman dumbness
19:08:50 <Zounds> That shit got all our healing nerfed >.<
19:10:20 <skram> Best period of pvp was when naxx was around because it was better for pvp than even rank14 gear
19:10:33 <skram> so i'd just show up with my t2s and t3s and tear shit up
19:11:04 <skram> shadowmeld -> aimed shot
19:11:17 <Zounds> https://i.imgur.com/YJMNxHE.jpg
19:11:22 <Zounds> my old rated bg team back in cata
19:12:20 <skram> cata is so recent :P
19:13:09 <Zounds> The world has been catafied longer than it wasn't
19:13:11 <Zounds> weird to think
19:13:25 <skram> yeah
19:13:30 <skram> its been 14 years
19:15:01 <Zounds> Always a good time at the start of a new expac
19:15:09 <Zounds> names you haven't seen in years all meeting up again
