22:26:44 <Dot`> cane, someone made the starcraft 1 campagn in Hammerwatch
22:26:47 <Dot`> lol
22:27:36 <Camail> dauntless, anyone
22:27:52 <Runbunny> I'm about to go sleep :/
22:28:26 <Dot`> i should sleep soon, i have to be at work early
22:28:35 <Dot`> becuase i am in charge tomorow
22:29:37 <Camail> nice
22:30:07 <Dot`> if someone comes in and stabs themselves with a sweet its my fault 
22:30:23 <Camail> well i was gonna celebrate the 4th of july
22:30:37 <Camail> but flying to england to inconvenience a brit seems  patriotic as well
22:31:09 <Dot`> sound sliek th eonly true way to celebrate the 4th of July
22:32:02 <Camail> any maybe even quake tomorrow
22:33:56 <Camail> I've not played in like a week, but in general i learned to not go so fast all the time
22:34:12 <Dot`> sounds like sacrilidge
22:34:16 <Camail> going fast is good, but maybe running into a 1v2 with only a rockert launcher isn't the best
22:34:30 <Camail> then they hug me with their shitty shotguns
22:34:55 <Runbunny> Shotgun is getting nerfed a bit. 
22:35:18 <Runbunny> at least that was what the patch notes on reddit said.
22:38:50 <Camail> i guess i never played against anyone with good enough movement to make it dangerous
22:39:04 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-163-99.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:39:19 <Camail> but really, if you have a good position and a longer range weapon i dont see you dying to a shotgun
22:39:32 <Camail> they really cant get close before taking so much damage
22:40:16 <Camail> tribolt and rockets seems like they would destroy someone trying to chase you with a shotgun
22:46:03 <Camail> pillars 2 got a big patch
22:50:32 <Phearlock__> oh I'l have to look at the notes
22:52:16 <Camail> boo my sick Rooting Pain build was nerfed to shit
22:52:25 <Camail> is was incidental but still its sad
22:52:38 <Camail> now my first run isn't nearly as broken
22:53:27 <Camail> oh no all the charm cipher spells were nerfed
22:53:46 <Camail> wtf they buffed everything i didnt use and nerfed the stuff i did
22:54:13 <Dot`> well if you want to play the game with all the broken stuff cam that will happen
22:54:17 <Dot`> :P
22:54:24 <Camail> i didnt even do that tho

23:11:57 <DuB`> Might finally get to Metro Last Light todey
23:12:00 <Camail> ooh Phearlock__  Deleterious alacrity on wizard now gives +15% action speed too
23:12:06 <Camail> more battle mage stuff
23:12:26 <Dot`> is nice game dub
23:13:30 <Camail> i have the first two games and love russian post-apoc stuff, but the gameplay is too clunky for me
23:16:32 <Phearlock__> I saw that change
23:16:35 <Phearlock__> is very nice
