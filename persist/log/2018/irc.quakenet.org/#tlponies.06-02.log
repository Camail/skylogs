21:45:56 <Camail> never thinks about my feelings when he does things

21:46:12 <Camail> like a good dog
21:46:14 <Zounds> so you might have a chance

21:46:35 <Camail> this is like monster hunter light
21:46:40 <Zounds> I'm on a PvP kick right now really
21:46:45 <Zounds> All I wanna do is fight people

21:48:15 <Phearlock> in TFH

21:50:52 <Camail> i was mega tilted
21:51:03 <Camail> well, by the end i got those 3 games
21:51:40 <Camail> he was in a flow state on offense, which really helps refine mix ups and set ups
21:52:10 <Camail> which are kinda non-existent in tfh, there's like 3 or 4 for each character
21:52:31 <Camail> a vast majority of the mental effort in tfh is in neutral because the offense is so simple
