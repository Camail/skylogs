00:00:05 <DuB`> No, I do not want to autocorrect "do the" to "soothe", OR "the" to "there"...
00:00:28 <Bio> theres far too much lewd going on in this  here F U C K I N chat
00:00:42 <Bio> REIN IT IN 
00:00:53 <carcinization> you tell em bio
00:21:36 <Camail> Zounds  i played ff14 solo, the story was very fun
00:22:27 <carcinization> zounds has probably ruined his palate with degeneracy so he cannot appreciate vanilla catgirls
00:22:29 <Camail> but it doesnt do well with trying to play through the story with someone who is finished with the story
00:23:02 <Camail> i...cant even remember which race i played
00:23:31 <carcinization> i liked how they did the world ending stuff
00:23:45 <Camail> going from v1 to v2, yea
00:23:57 <Zounds> Yeah my bro played since v1
00:24:12 <Zounds> v1 actually looked kinda decent
00:24:15 <Zounds> too bad there was nothing to do
00:24:47 <Zounds> carcinization: no degeneracy (well some)
00:24:56 <Zounds> I just don't see the point in the cat ears
00:25:23 <Camail> they're cute
00:25:36 <Crisium> im confused now
00:25:46 <Crisium> zounds wants more cats in his cat girls, but doesnt want cat ears?
00:25:58 <Zounds> I don't want cat ears on generic anime women
00:26:07 <Zounds> I've been through this here before I don't know if I wanna go over it again :P
00:26:33 <Zounds> People like what they like and I'm okay with it
00:27:03 <Crisium> https://static1.fjcdn.com/comments/Blank+_1707bb9de2febe4deb3bd788f27fb7a1.jpg
00:27:04 <carcinization> the curse of having odd opinions is having to explain repeatedly zounds
00:28:17 <Zounds> Tsuyu Asui
00:28:24 <Zounds> If you want an animal girl with mostly regular features
00:28:26 <Zounds> that's good shit
00:29:26 <Camail> cat ears are like a bow
00:29:29 <Camail> or a maid outfit
00:29:41 <Zounds> But they're not
00:29:49 <Camail> the only thin that creeps me out is the misogyny disguised as pet play
00:30:44 <Camail> i'm not trying to convince you zounds, just telling you the truth
00:30:53 <carcinization> i have to go to the capitol of nerve agent poisoning tomorrow so i should probably sleep now
00:30:55 <carcinization> night all
00:31:00 <Zounds> gl reef
00:31:02 <Camail> from a character design perspective, its all accessory

00:37:27 <Camail> oh
00:37:28 <Camail> no
00:37:41 <Camail> they are the worst
00:37:43 <Zounds> Cross a potato with an onion
00:37:55 <Camail> i hated every lala i ever encountered
00:38:16 <Camail> especially the story relevant ones THEY CANT EVEN WALK RIGHT
00:38:36 <Zounds> Is it like WoW where the short races have to take huge leaps to keep up
00:38:39 <Zounds> high paced waddling
00:39:11 <Camail> i never bothered to look at PC models, but the waddle is just the wooorst
00:39:50 <Zounds> eh everything else just looks like humans but tall or wide
00:39:55 <Zounds> or with cat easrs
00:39:56 <Zounds> ears
00:40:47 <Zounds> human but short and shaped like a potato might be ideal
00:42:17 <Zounds> It's the same races as FFXI but dialed back a bit

22:50:31 <DuB`> LILBIRBS
22:51:43 <Zounds> I mean if Crisium feels like playing more I'd 3stack
22:52:02 <DuB`> There is also a carcinization
22:52:15 <DuB`> No mocen or skrm
22:52:58 <Camail> skram went to jail
22:53:07 <Camail> he'll be busy for awhile
22:55:28 <DuB`> O my
22:55:51 <Runbunny> Those are some cute birbs Dub.
22:56:29 <DuB`> trooly
22:56:40 <DuB`> Well, if no OW then maybe I try this "csgo" thing
22:57:26 <Zounds> gl my dude
22:57:29 <Dot> dub has already abandoned being cheeky breeki
22:57:45 <DuB`> Well I'm not about to play solo
22:57:50 <DuB`> Wouldn't even know where to go!
22:59:15 <Zounds> So many varities of shoots
22:59:24 -!- tredc [~tredc@c83-251-171-164.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:59:44 <Zounds> Though CSGO and tarkov is more shoots than OW
22:59:48 <Zounds> OW is more fisted than shoots
23:00:47 <Camail> ow becomes less shoots each new character
23:00:59 <DuB`> T_T
23:01:05 <Zounds> Yes and it's a damned travesty :(
23:01:39 <Camail> meanwhile csgo just got a new shoot
23:01:44 <Camail> which is actually an old shoot
23:02:42 <Zounds> I miss stacking NS2
23:02:49 <Zounds> That game had a great combination of shoots and chomps
23:02:54 <Dot> that was fun
23:03:01 <Dot> and GORGE SLIDES
23:03:53 <Zounds> Plus it was such a pain in the ass getting on the same team we just fought each other sometimes
23:04:00 <Zounds> And I love competing with and against pons
23:05:47 <DuB`> I missed that phase :o
23:06:07 <Zounds> you would have loved it
23:09:19 <Camail> i've been doing cs overwatch cases, and it's surprisingly entertaining
23:09:51 <Zounds> caught any blatant hackers yet?
23:09:55 <Camail> it's like watching old silent movies, gotta read a lot of body language
23:10:06 <Camail> oh yea those are fun because i can fast forward once i see the spin bot
23:10:18 <Camail> i'd say 25% are blatant like that
23:10:45 <Camail> trigger bots are always the worst
23:11:00 <Camail> because its a hack where your gun onbly fire if you crosshair is on an enemy model
23:11:19 <Camail> so it covers the hack with someones natural mouse movements, but they just always shoot at the perfect time
23:11:38 <Camail> but maybe dont have 95% headshots next time dude
23:12:13 <Camail> also when obvious WHers pretend to peek for info
23:12:38 <Camail> it's like a lazy teenagers feigned interest in doing chores
23:12:51 <Zounds> haha
23:13:20 <Camail> they know they should do it, but they rebel through pure apathy
23:13:49 <Camail> it IS boring to watch too many tho, because most people only play dust 2
23:14:09 <Camail> it's like they cant handle another map in their tiny little moba world view
23:16:18 <Bio> asdf
23:20:31 <Zounds> It's always desert shitholes that are popular in games for some reason
23:20:53 <Zounds> Even in planetside left to their own devices the shitter hordes would go to Indar and never leave
23:22:03 <Zounds> Karkand in BF2
23:22:23 <DuB`> Foliage gets in the way of the shoots! :P
23:24:25 <Camail> dust 2 has 3 lanes, with very little interesting map control options
23:24:43 <Camail> put any dust 2 scrub onto mirage and they will have no idea what to do
23:25:03 <Camail> or even why they're losing
23:32:47 <Camail> carcinization woooah slay the spire daily is a draft today
23:32:52 <Camail> new mechanics
23:33:00 <Camail> really its just a bunch of card rewards
