00:04:44 <Crisium> hoi
00:08:12 <skram> cris ur l8
00:08:28 <Crisium> i was at an anime/game con
00:08:37 <Crisium> lost in 1st round of OW, but won the Splatoon 2
00:08:40 <Micen> lies
00:08:48 <Micen> dub zounds and I saw you on OW
00:09:00 <Crisium> yeah, i had to log into my account to play lol
00:09:03 <DuB`> Won!
00:09:07 <DuB`> Splat pro
00:29:07 <Zounds> I always wanted to try that game
00:29:14 <Zounds> But not enough to buy a console for it
00:29:35 <Crisium> its very fun
00:29:46 <DuB`> Best tracer in the world gets a 3k bomb to win the match
00:29:51 <DuB`> Because of course he does
00:31:10 <skram> do u mean soon
00:31:13 <skram> or the other guy
00:31:17 <Crisium> sbb?
00:31:21 <DuB`> Saebyeolbe
00:32:23 <skram> that guy
00:32:24 <skram> yes
00:34:25 <Dot> skram!
00:34:53 <skram> I thought you said he won the match :thinking:
00:34:54 <skram> dot!
00:35:12 <skram> How's your face?
00:36:08 <Dot> sleep soon i tihnk

01:02:46 <skram> This is just sad at this point DuB`
01:10:58 <BioPhone> Micen
01:11:10 <Micen|Droid_> . Yes 
01:11:23 <BioPhone> Remember when I said the avs v blues game would determine who would get in
01:11:28 <BioPhone> Here we are
01:12:01 <BioPhone> Though, cause we won VS hawks yesterday, we only need to take it to OT
01:12:50 <BioPhone> Last game of the year, last 2 teams in the West, one in, one out
01:13:20 <Micen|Droid_> Just this once I'll cheer Blues 
01:19:32 <Crisium> Bio was right
01:28:58 <BioPhone> Here's to hoping
01:29:44 <BioPhone> Dunno if this is the cup winning team, and we'd have to play the perds. But, moar hockey is good
01:35:20 <Crisium> preds can be beaten
01:35:44 <Crisium> pekka rinne is just a man
02:43:33 <Crisium> cmon blues, turn it around
03:04:28 <BioPhone> We are so fucking injured
03:04:43 <BioPhone> Fuck the refs
03:04:49 <BioPhone> Fuck the avs
03:20:45 <Crisium> :(
03:42:33 <Micen> That bad?
03:48:05 <BioPhone> We lost tarasekno halfway through the first
03:48:29 <BioPhone> Then we got screwed on an offside challenge
03:48:59 <BioPhone> It's all but over
03:49:50 <Micen> Hawks have come back with less time. there's still hope
03:54:23 <BioPhone> En goal, it's over
03:54:31 <BioPhone> Fuck
