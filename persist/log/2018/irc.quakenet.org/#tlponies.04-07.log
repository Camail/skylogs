03:26:17 <Camail> dub you'll enjoy this
03:26:31 <Camail> my brother plays a deck in legacy that uses lions eye diamonds
03:26:38 <Camail> he bought them for 40 each, so a 120 playset
03:26:42 <Camail> they are now 250 each
03:27:19 <DuB`> Yowza
03:27:20 <Camail> so he now owns a 1k+ deck because people are crazy
03:28:31 <BioPhone> Magic is silly
03:28:39 <BioPhone> Fun and silly
03:29:08 <Camail> well, if you want to get the CHEAPEST led its 200 each
03:29:10 <DuB`> https://shop.tcgplayer.com/magic/scars-of-mirrodin/mox-opal
03:29:11 <Camail> but the median is 250
03:29:19 <Camail> mox is money
03:29:31 <DuB`> This is one I saw recommended a lot when looking for fun artifact stuff
03:29:31 <Camail> .mtg
03:29:37 <Camail> .mtg mox opal
03:30:07 <Camail> sweetie pls
03:30:17 <Camail> maybe that plugin is broken
03:30:45 <DuB`> zzz
03:33:48 <Camail> but yea who ever thought mox were a good idea
03:34:13 <Camail> imagine being allowed to play sets of mox
03:34:20 <Camail> you wouldn't even play lands
03:42:02 <DuB`> Speaking of land
03:42:05 <DuB`> I have just one of these

17:26:15 <Phearlock> He kept going "can I get a switch, can I get a switch, canIgetaswitch, canIgetaswitch"
17:26:24 <Phearlock> And his mom was just completely ignoring him
17:26:34 <Phearlock> Eventually she turns around and lightly baps his nose
17:26:41 <Phearlock> and he was mortified
17:27:00 <Phearlock> I had to try really hard to not laugh at this.
17:27:24 <Phearlock> Best part of my day so far really

17:27:58 <Phearlock> Hey dot =D
17:29:06 <Phearlock> So I was thinking the other day. And I think I might just want to grab a rogue for Dnd unless there's a major lack of the castery casty bois.
17:29:20 <Phearlock> Because its' a class I haven't done yet
17:29:44 <Phearlock> and having all the skills seems nice.
17:29:54 <Dot> fine with me, having a rogue is nice
17:30:16 <Dot> i was doing reading as i do when i have too much time to make a character
17:30:24 <Dot> and Paldin.Sorc seems fun
17:30:46 <Phearlock> huh
17:31:20 <Phearlock> that sounds really cool
17:31:35 <Dot> also spell slots get weird when you multiclass
17:31:49 <Phearlock> That's ok as long as I don't have to deal with it
17:31:54 <Phearlock> =D
17:32:19 <Dot> i dont tihnk i will ever play a straight sorcerer, i would rather go wizard
17:32:27 <Dot> so thise would allow me to try one
17:32:29 <Dot> kinda
17:34:00 <Dot> but yea, will have to see how magicky other party members are
17:34:18 <Dot> i know TJ wanted to play a gunslinger becuase he likes guns
17:34:35 <Phearlock> Sounds american
17:34:43 <Dot> a very american canadian
17:34:51 <Phearlock> Nice
17:35:16 <Phearlock> But yeah I still like druids. So that's still a good alternate =P
17:36:07 <Dot> last count TJ owned 3 SKS's in canada
17:36:20 <Dot> apparently getting old russian guns is really easy there
17:36:27 <Phearlock> haha
17:36:55 <Dot> Druids do look super fun, so flexible
17:37:10 <Dot> and really strong early levels if moon
17:37:18 <Phearlock> I'd probably pick one of the circle druid variants next time for extra spells and less moon.
17:37:24 <Phearlock> Rely on everyone else to do OP things.
17:37:39 <Dot> Shepard becuase cute dog pic in Xanathars
17:38:42 <Dot> phear, you have a copy of xanathars yet? 
17:38:59 <Phearlock> Don't thik so
17:39:08 <Dot> give me a second then
17:39:18 <Phearlock> can you send a perfectly legal dropbox or similar link to me on discord?
17:39:28 <Phearlock> Not logged into the desktop on IRC
17:39:33 <Dot> of course, nothing but the most legal!
17:41:36 <Dot> xanathars has 3 new subclasses for each class
17:42:07 <Dot> rogue swashbuckler is probably my favrite one for that class
17:42:13 <Dot> scout is close second
17:51:26 <Dot> https://www.twitch.tv/ogaminginter
17:51:44 <Dot> Kalegod!
17:56:24 <Phearlock> Damn it dot I don't need all these extra options to consider
17:56:28 <Phearlock> Terrible =D
17:56:39 <Dot> im very sorry

20:14:35 <Zounds> yeh I've never played but i hear there's cabins, cold and wolves
20:14:50 <Zounds> you should feel at home
20:14:53 <DuB`> So... Skram's House Simulator
20:15:07 <Micen> but that's dedgaem dot
20:15:16 <skram> There arent any wolves here yet
20:15:18 <Micen> and not the new hotness

20:16:53 <Dot> edge hors
20:16:56 <DuB`> That's a strangely colored dog.
20:16:57 <Micen> I dont doubt it, but i have this all access pass thing for free for a bit 
20:17:22 <skram> is nudie games on steam a new thing
20:17:26 <Dot> phear, you read through xanathars a bit?
20:17:30 <Phearlock> yeah
20:17:44 <Micen> Dot, i tried doing art recently. I forgot how to draw. 
20:17:50 <Micen> you didnt keep on me to do art 
20:17:57 <Micen> :P
20:18:00 <Dot> you see the cute wolf cubs in the druid section phear?
20:18:09 <Phearlock> For rogue I still think the original theif archetype looks most appealing. Sheperd drood looks alright though.
20:18:12 <Phearlock> Yes dot
20:18:15 <Phearlock> And the bear hug
20:18:19 <Dot> yes!
20:18:32 <Zounds> After all these years I still get uncomfortable seeing Humans and ponies in the same pics
20:18:48 <Zounds> Some deep seated dislike in there somewhere
20:19:01 <Phearlock> Zounds is scared or horses IRL?
20:19:08 <Phearlock> of*
20:19:17 <DuB`> Probably because ponies are fake
20:19:19 <Phearlock> I mean they are pretty intimidating sometimes.
20:19:22 <Phearlock> Big
20:19:22 <Zounds> No I think at the time I started watching pons I was really after escapism
20:19:26 <Zounds> and humans were not escapism
20:19:29 <Zounds> So... :P
20:19:31 <Phearlock> Ah =D
20:19:38 <Dot> Real pastel coloured horses should probably be avoided
20:19:55 <Phearlock> Depends on if they start talking to me or not.
20:20:13 <Micen> which is to be avoided, i they do or dont?
20:20:26 <Phearlock> If they are. I've probably been drugged or you're in a first contact situation.
20:20:42 <Phearlock> And I'd be happy talking to the pastel horses
20:20:42 <Zounds> I wonder how I would react to that
20:20:51 <Dot> gg TLO
20:20:52 <Phearlock> Scared as shit ofc
20:20:57 <Zounds> Probably
20:21:07 <skram> horses are the worst
20:21:10 <skram> only good for eatin'
20:21:24 <DuB`> MHMM
20:21:41 <Micen> a horse broke my grandmothers hip when i was young
20:21:48 <Zounds> she had it coming
20:21:52 <Micen> wait not her hip 
20:21:59 <Micen> that was when she broke her back
20:22:18 <Micen> she had a fractured spine and still got the horse back in its pen. 
20:22:35 <skram> and then she turned it into glue?
20:22:46 <Micen> Then we sold it for big money
20:22:59 <Micen> because he was still good to stud out. 
20:23:37 <Dot> i tihnk thief is the rogue class ive seen least of phear
20:24:47 <Phearlock> Cause it's just chill and everyone wants to be edgy or dashing
