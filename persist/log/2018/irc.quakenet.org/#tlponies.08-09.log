01:53:27 <DuB`> skram
01:53:41 <skram> hi
01:54:13 <DuB`> hollo
01:54:25 <DuB`> <sweetiebot> Dot said 4 hours, 15 minutes ago in #tlponies: HI
01:54:33 <DuB`> I don't know what to do with this!
01:54:37 <DuB`> .tell dot hi
01:54:48 <skram> looks like you did know
01:54:50 <skram> :D
01:55:59 <Camail> dub how space rich did you get
01:57:14 <DuB`> Enough to buy 34-slot freighter and 40-slot hauler and a fighter, all class A
01:57:19 <DuB`> And a bunch o' frigates!
01:57:49 <DuB`> And I have 170m left!
02:00:25 <Camail> thats a lot of grinding
02:00:30 <Camail> what was it, 5m-ish a mission?
02:00:38 <Camail> also did you ever do the main quests
02:00:58 <Camail> you could probably buy enough mats to make all the warp cells you'll ever need
02:02:02 <DuB`> Yeh 5m, and I got lucky with a couple valuable blueprints so I could combo the less valuable stuff I ended up getting on the side
02:02:19 <DuB`> And randomly had a frigate mission bring back like 20m of stuff >_>
02:02:24 <DuB`> When it's usually like 300k
02:02:46 <Camail> thats pleasant
02:02:52 <Camail> can you make fuel yet?
02:02:58 <Camail> that seems like a roadblock
02:03:09 <Camail> i guess you can buy it in someplaces tho
02:03:21 <DuB`> Yeah update fixed that
02:03:32 <Camail> once you could put a selling station on your freighter there was no reason to ever visit stations
02:03:37 <DuB`> And a couple of quest bugs that had me stalled
02:04:03 <Camail> updates didnt fix my issue but in the end i just had to edit the json file
02:04:26 <Camail> which basically put me at the very end of the game
02:04:57 <Camail> i might use all my money to make warp juice to get to the center quickly
02:05:52 <Camail> all i need is some better warp drive upgrades to make black holes single hops
02:06:28 <DuB`> I haven't seen a BH :O
02:06:42 <Camail> then you havent done the main quests
02:06:47 <DuB`> ... probably because I've just been warping around a small cluster the whole time and not moving :P
02:06:59 <Camail> just do the atlas path
02:07:14 <DuB`> Yeah I've done like 5
02:07:16 <Camail> also pls, you are the least traveling traveler ever
02:07:28 <DuB`> Perhaps
02:07:56 <DuB`> I can warp like 1000ly and only use 5% of a full warpdrive though, which is nice
02:08:34 <Camail> in the freighter?
02:09:27 <DuB`> S class exotic with like +67% warp stat and a bunch of modules
02:09:29 <Camail> well, that's not terribly relevant because blackhole hopping is the only real way to get to the center, and they're like 500ly apart at most
04:09:38 <Camail> man whatever they did with slay the spire must be working, according to steam roughly half the owners of the game have finished a run

18:39:43 <Cane> It's QuakeCon weekend. Are you ready?
18:39:44 <Camail> hi cane
18:39:46 <Cane> Also did you watch Evo?
18:40:04 <Camail> i did, it was very high definition
18:40:12 <Camail> i guess that's what happens when you go there
18:40:53 <Cane> Huh, must have had nice cameras.
18:41:10 <Cane> Did you get to watch everything you wanted?
18:41:36 <Camail> nah, there's just too much. but i got to see a lot of cool things
18:41:48 <Camail> tokido had some nasty combos in pools
18:42:01 <Cane> That dude is pretty good at Street Fighter.
18:42:04 <Cane> Have you noticed?
18:42:07 <Camail> and i didnt go 0-2, which was good
18:42:15 <Cane> Oh sweet.
18:42:15 <Camail> yea he's been in the gf two years in a row now
18:42:31 <Camail> so he's probably the best sf player ever
18:43:16 <Cane> Most people would argue with you. I'm actually not one of them.

19:00:21 <Camail> saw everything on sunday other than gg
19:00:45 <Camail> didn't watch any of the saturday top 8's because i was watching sf5 and playing casuals
19:01:57 <Camail> tekken was hype because usa, dbfz was kinda hype but went way too long, each game lasted at least 3 minutes

19:02:08 <Camail> everyone was sooo tired by the time sf5 came on
19:02:29 <Camail> i kinda hope they put sf5 on earlier next year so i can leave before dbfz

19:10:29 <Cane> Best thing about DBFZ was all of the Evo crowd going all "Raise The Roof" mode during the Cell intros.
19:12:42 <Camail> yea that was fun to do, and it turns out that cell uses pretty good posture for those screams, cuz its way easier to do them when you sit up straight
19:24:00 <Dot`> i return from bike ride
