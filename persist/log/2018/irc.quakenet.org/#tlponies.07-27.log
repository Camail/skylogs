05:11:57 <Camail> SAM
05:11:59 <Camail> OMG 
05:12:44 <Camail> the firecracker diversion was actually pretty relevant 
05:13:06 <Camail> this fight i'd give her a 10/10 in the first 3 turns, no misplays like usual
05:13:15 <Bio> k
05:13:22 <Bio> i pulled in right as she threw it
05:13:30 <Bio> and thought it would wake everyone the fuck up in there
05:13:37 <Camail> oh no they were already awake
05:13:42 <Camail> nott was sneaking in and rolled a 1
05:13:49 <Bio> lel
05:14:10 <Bio> also lel furbolg
05:14:23 <Camail> also nott just made this fight 100 times easier
05:14:36 <Camail> considering their druid is dead, no one is gonna dispel that laughter
05:15:45 <Camail> omg thats soooo good she missed
05:17:45 <Bio> that was a worth surge
05:18:22 <Camail> ideally she didnt hit the barb at all
05:18:35 <Camail> and waited for the party to surround and kill
05:18:49 <Camail> hideous laughter is nuts
05:19:00 <Bio> tru
05:22:05 <Micen|Droid> She did have the mage killer sword to dispel 
05:23:32 <Camail> ....no
05:23:38 <Camail> she was incapacitated 
05:23:44 <Camail> meaning she couldnt take any actions
05:23:55 <Micen|Droid> Oh yeah. 
05:24:45 <Camail> aaaand this fight just went from 100% victory to like a chance at a death
05:27:03 <Camail> SAM PLEASE
05:27:05 <Camail> FUCK
05:27:14 <Bio> werst rouge
05:29:19 <Bio> i feel like theres more in this place
05:29:33 <Bio> more enemies
05:29:44 <Camail> yea but it's been 4 turns, so basically 30 seconds
05:30:19 <Camail> and they managed to infiltrate all the way up to the building without any alerts, which took awhile
05:30:25 <Camail> so they rely on their guards a lot
05:32:48 <Camail> whew
05:33:49 <Micen|Droid> God these descriptions. 
05:36:06 <Camail> uh oh, did lorenzo leave for another job
05:37:28 <Bio> or hes downstairs and gonna fuckin breathe WINTER on them
05:42:35 <Bio> what looks to be
05:44:11 <Bio> lorenzo is actually probably not here
05:44:42 <Bio> if matt wants him to be an antagonist for a while until the crew is back together or somethin
05:44:57 <Camail> yea, and there's plenty of reason not to have him there
05:45:03 <Camail> he's a busy person
05:47:36 <Camail> using the familiar to scout is a good, classic dnd move
05:47:49 <Bio> can confirm
05:47:55 <Bio> my wiz's familiar was a spider
05:48:46 <Camail> this side smile is amazing

23:35:43 <Cane> I'm home baby.
23:38:29 <Dot> cane!
23:38:33 <Dot> how was the outside?
23:38:52 <Cane> Norwegian nights are not supposed to be this hot and humid. It's not right.
23:38:56 <Cane> At least there's a blood moon out.
23:39:29 <Dot> just a noisy cow outside here
23:42:05 <Cane> I just spent ~8 hours at Halvgud's.
23:42:10 <Cane> Food and movies and talk.
23:43:26 <BioSC> cane watch for all the zomboes
23:43:43 <Cane> It was completely empty actually.
23:43:50 <Cane> Kind of impressively quiet and eerie.
23:43:52 <BioSC> also i'm still fuckin bad at terraria
23:44:00 <Cane> So, you know, I was loving it.
23:44:11 <Cane> Just gotta press buttons better Bio.
23:44:56 <BioSC> 3 hard
23:44:56 <skrma> did you go to the south cane
23:47:56 <Cane> No, he's on vacation for a week so we met up.
23:48:08 <Cane> And I took this picture while I was out walkin' home. https://i.imgur.com/lPrtwCQ.jpg
23:48:56 <skrma> nice
23:48:58 <skrma> is this bodø
23:49:15 <Cane> No, Fauske, 60km away.
23:49:33 <skrma> cool
23:49:52 <Dot> there is no one there cane
23:50:01 <Cane> Which is how I survived.
23:50:01 <Dot> is norway emtpy but for 3 ppl?
23:50:16 <Cane> I think I saw exactly 3 people my entire walk.
23:50:18 <Cane> So probably.
23:50:32 <skrma> well the north is deserted Dot
23:50:39 <Dot> sounds ideal
23:50:40 <skrma> as a proper søring ive obviously never been north of trondheim
23:56:46 <Dot> how very correct of you
