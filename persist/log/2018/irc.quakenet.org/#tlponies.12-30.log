21:15:15 <Dot`> but i wanted oyu to be free sooner
21:15:24 <Dot`> so i could spend more time with the skrammen
21:17:07 <skram> someones gotta keep the fire goin' lad
21:18:57 <DuB`> Was away dot, sorry!
21:19:18 <DuB`> Yay skram :D
21:37:57 <DuB`> Big blizzard starting suddenly :O
21:41:40 <skram> WOOOO
21:44:59 <Dot`> Division Dub?
21:45:01 <Dot`> for a bit
21:45:07 <Dot`> though im already pretty tired
21:50:07 <DuB`> Doin' lunch and stellaris and some smash after
21:59:25 <skram> ive decided to do a nap
21:59:30 <skram> or maybe an entire spleep
21:59:45 <Dot`> gl skram
21:59:47 <Dot`> <3
21:59:54 <skram> <3
22:00:37 <Dot`> Dub, what dlc's do you think are important or add a lot to stellaris
22:00:39 <Dot`> so many dlc
22:01:21 <DuB`> Ya
22:01:22 <DuB`> Um
22:02:52 <DuB`> New megacorp is super but still $20 obviously
22:03:02 <DuB`> Utopia is the most worth and necessary one, I think
22:03:31 <DuB`> Then synthetic dawn (ROBOT GESTALT EMPIRES, HIVE MIND BUGS!) in second
22:04:12 <DuB`> All the species packs and story packs are nice additional "stuff" but don't add mechanics
22:05:46 <DuB`> Apocalypse is probably the least worth its price, but still adds a decent bit as a "big" dlc
22:17:09 <BioPhone> Horsens
22:17:19 <BioPhone> Vacation is almost overs Tt
22:17:26 <BioPhone> T_T
22:17:59 <Crisium> sadness
