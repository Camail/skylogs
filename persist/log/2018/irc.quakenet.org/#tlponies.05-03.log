00:52:43 <skrm> this game has some spicy meems
00:53:13 <DuB`> Pic of bun in discrod
00:55:08 <skrm> very good bunny
00:58:00 <Bio> man
00:58:03 <Bio> is it thursday yet
00:58:58 <skrm> You know what sorta irritates me abit about the momentums dub
00:59:17 <skrm> the cord is on the RIGHT side whereas every single other headset ever has it on the left
01:00:36 <DuB`> Hm
01:00:49 <DuB`> Meh :P
01:01:10 <DuB`> I remember thinking it was odd but it's never bothered me.
01:01:21 <Bio> mines on the left
01:01:25 <Bio> but my computer is on my right
01:01:30 <Bio> so the cord is always in my lap
01:02:36 <Bio> https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E
01:02:43 <Bio> its got a 10ft cord lel
01:02:45 <Camail> cords are usually longer than they need to be, I wrap mine around the back
01:02:59 <Bio> i've had this headphones for like 8 years or some shit
01:03:03 <Camail> skram we miss u
01:03:05 <Bio> still working awesome
01:03:09 <Camail> the bed is a little colder with just 3 people
01:03:20 <Bio> its just not a pile anymore
01:03:26 <Bio> its like an awkward triangle
01:03:37 <Camail> if everyone is up for it we can play more later tonight
01:03:50 <skrm> i can play in 4 hours
01:03:51 <skrm> :p
01:04:02 <Bio> midnight
01:04:05 <Bio> bold strat
01:05:47 <Camail> DuB`  oh yea, mining cave carrots and winter root is great for roots platter
01:06:08 <DuB`> Will start keeping em
01:06:13 <Camail> its a pretty efficient food item
01:06:28 <Camail> none of use upgrades the hoes tho, which makes it harder to grind for them
01:06:32 <Camail> us*
01:06:58 <DuB`> Right
01:07:09 <DuB`> We should grab the <10k g vault packs
01:07:20 <DuB`> Start building up batteries with lightning rod 'n stuf
01:10:12 <skrm> you're gonna be done with all the things before i can plej again
01:11:44 <DuB`> Psh no
01:12:07 <Camail> we might get to fall tonight, but not farther
01:12:45 <Camail> we need to get battery packs for sprinklers
01:12:55 <Camail> iridium sprinklers pay off in scalability big time
01:13:50 <Camail> I dont have enough foraging to get lightning rods, bio is close
01:15:35 <Camail> oh i know what i want to do, i want to grind the mines to make a ton of crab pots
01:16:23 <skrm> have you gotten to 120 yet
01:16:39 <DuB`> Ye
01:17:02 <skrm> :(
01:17:41 <Camail> that was all dub, and his insatiable spelunking lust
01:18:31 <Camail> desperado looks cool
01:18:44 <Camail> you'd need all the crit chance stuff tho
01:18:47 <DuB`> Yeah, will be fun
01:19:00 <DuB`> Max crit chance possible with a certain dagger + 2 crit rings is like 10% though :P
01:19:56 <Camail> yea its not worth much :P
01:37:34 <Phearlock_> Finished up Battletech
01:38:13 <Phearlock_> Final verdict would be: Really fun and relaxing turn-based strategy. Bit too easy later on.

01:42:14 <Phearlock_> Pretty happy how I was completely unaware of the game until it launched and then had such a fun time with it. =P
01:42:38 <Phearlock_> Menus were somehow really slow though.
01:42:44 <Phearlock_> now sure how that is a thing in 2018
01:45:10 <Phearlock_> not*
02:18:19 <Crisium> they still make RTS games?
02:22:15 <Camail> cris ur a farm animal
02:22:25 <Camail> though we are running out of tlp names to name stuff
02:22:32 <Camail> so you might become multiple 
02:26:46 <Crisium> yay
02:54:20 <Crisium> Glads one step closer to stage playoffs
02:54:54 <Crisium> well i need sleeps
02:55:16 <DuB`> Yep, close to locked in now
02:55:19 <DuB`> nn cris
02:58:03 <Camail> should we farm again
03:03:55 <DuB`> skrm is still wrk!
03:04:24 <Camail> yea... its gonna be hella late tho once he gets back
03:04:34 <Camail> and we dont know how tired he will be
03:04:50 <Camail> but FINE, I guess I'll do some research on what to do
03:05:02 <skrm> ill be fiiiiiiine
03:05:28 <Camail> I need a lot of copper and wood for crab pots
03:05:57 <Camail> oh btw we've been sharing tools so if you dont have something in your inventory check the purple box
03:14:09 <Camail> we wont be able to reliably get iridium sprinklers until we get the bus
03:14:24 <DuB`> $$$
03:19:11 <Camail> which will be easy to get now that we have a lot of animals and fruit money
03:22:50 <DuB`> Pretty easy to speedfarm the bottom of the mine now too
03:24:02 <Camail> well i need copper so i am gonna go shallow
03:24:09 <Camail> good to increase mining skill, anyway
03:26:10 <DuB`> O ya
03:26:25 <DuB`> I got 75+ copper ore in a 30-40 run earlier
03:26:47 <DuB`> Still need Dwarf Scroll I from down there too haha
03:27:37 <DuB`> Man, that lv10 guaranteed purple-star quality foraging is wild
03:27:41 <DuB`> So hard to level that though
03:29:28 <DuB`> Pretty sure I'm still lv1 foraging and fishing :P
03:38:51 <Camail> cuttings trees is the easiest way
03:38:59 <Camail> especially with the respawning stumps in the secret area
03:39:34 <Camail> but also there's less xp to go around when everyone cleared the farm...
03:41:47 <DuB`> Yyyyeah the farm was empty by like day 4 lol
03:49:01 <Camail> I'm gonna upgrade my axe once we get in
03:49:24 <Camail> DuB`  i have an idea, lets play an entire year and get back to the day we quit on
03:49:27 <Camail> and hope they dont notice
03:50:21 <DuB`> :D
03:51:22 <DuB`> An entire year in 2 hours, bold
03:51:33 <Camail> there are mods
03:51:42 <DuB`> Of course there are
03:51:59 <DuB`> There are also probably nude mods
03:52:04 <Camail> there are mods that slow time, but that's boring
03:52:10 <Camail> the race is part of it

18:18:14 <DuB`> Zounds: Brigitte Shield Bash - Cone angle reduced from 90 to 60
18:18:25 <skram> undeserved
18:18:29 <DuB`> When fighting against Brigitte, it often felt like Shield Bash was able to hit players who felt like they were out of its range and should have dodged it. On the flip side, when playing as Brigitte sometimes players would hit the wrong enemy in the middle of a fight. With the cone being reduced, the ability is more accurate to its visual representation.
18:18:39 <DuB`> It's a start...
18:19:04 <skram> Just make it stun everything instead
18:19:51 <reification> global bash
18:20:03 <DuB`> lul
18:20:17 <DuB`> On ptr max armor buildup from rally down 150->100 too
18:20:27 <DuB`> The bash change is going straight to live
18:21:33 <reification> that armour change is good for making it an in fight not prefight ult
18:21:44 <Bio> they honestly should make her ult like lucios ult
18:21:55 <Bio> and decay off
18:22:19 <Bio> or like have the armor for 15s then decay or something

20:05:45 <Phearlock> Last time I looked at it they changed so much from when I played it (during beta) that I didn't know where to start.
20:06:43 <Zounds_> I haven't played it in a while either though I quite enjoyed it when I did
20:07:00 <Zounds_> Really enjoyed my CN9-AL
20:07:26 <Phearlock> my 3F stalker was my gig.
20:07:35 <Phearlock> Loved the big stompy stompy
20:07:50 <Zounds_> I also cheesed a bit with 6 small pulse lasers on a...Locust I think?
20:07:55 <Zounds_> can't remember exactly which light mech it was
20:08:01 <Zounds_> one of the biped grasshoper looking ones though
20:08:05 <Zounds_> but not the cicada
20:08:16 <Zounds_> well they're all bipeds I guess
20:08:28 <Phearlock> Jenner maybe? that thing could laserboat
20:08:55 <Zounds_> That loadout was kinda shit but it worked in the city maps sorta
20:09:30 <Zounds_> Could be, I would have to check
20:09:33 <Zounds_> sounds familiar
20:10:38 <Phearlock> Oh I only have to wait 4 days before pillars of eternity 2 is released. That's good then.
20:10:42 <Zounds_> yeah Jenner is correct
20:10:48 <Zounds_> jumpjets and lasers

20:11:04 <Phearlock> Very hot little light mech but it had a medium's worth of firepower.
20:12:02 <Phearlock> It still did exactly that (go fast, jump around, overheat, shoot lots of pew) in the turn based battletech so.
20:12:11 <Phearlock> They kept stuff consistent xD
20:12:56 <Zounds_> I tend to like the fast mechs
20:13:11 <Zounds_> heaviest I ever piloted was a Jaegermech I think
20:13:19 <Zounds_> hurt like hell but not really my scene for the most part
20:14:12 <Phearlock> I liked the slow tactical stuff so heavies and assaults were my favorites.
20:15:11 <Phearlock> Going fast was fun though
20:15:27 <Zounds_> Yeah
20:15:36 <Zounds_> When I played you couldn't really know what maps you were ending up on
20:15:44 <Zounds_> or who your teammates where gonna be at all
20:15:46 <Phearlock> Yup same
20:16:06 <Zounds_> So as much fun as lasing targets as an ECM spider could be
20:16:14 <Zounds_> it wasn't always viable if you've got no LRM boats
20:16:27 <Phearlock> Hah, same reason I stopped using LRM boats.
20:17:17 <Zounds_> I think that's why the CN9-AL was my fave
20:17:26 <Phearlock> My stalker ended up quite LRM-less but enough heat sinks that it could happily blast away with twin ER PPCs for a looooong time before needing to cool.
20:17:46 <Zounds_> 2 ER large lasers, 2 medium lasers in the torso
20:17:53 <Phearlock> And enough tonnage for a spare array of mlasers and srms incase things ever got close.
20:17:56 <Zounds_> and a spare arm with nothing but armor to survive with
20:18:04 <Phearlock> Aw no big boi AC?
20:18:21 <Zounds_> I think another one of my centurions had that
20:18:23 <Phearlock> yay
20:18:33 <Phearlock> Big boi AC memes were good stuf

23:20:45 <Dot> gnight reif
23:24:37 <Camail> i got engaged first
23:24:43 <Camail> which means my marriage will be the best
23:24:50 <Camail> #1, all other farmers lay low in my wake
23:24:55 <DuB`> Because you took all the resources for house expansion! :P
23:25:05 <Camail> we didnt know that
23:25:20 <Camail> mine was still gonna happen on the same day
23:25:33 <Camail> also decay never stops for your wife
23:25:39 <Camail> so you gotta talk to her
23:26:06 <DuB`> get to*!
23:26:15 <DuB`> Or do you NOT ACTUALLY LOVE HER
23:26:59 <Camail> I can enjoy my obligations
23:27:20 <Zounds_> what does your wife do for you
23:27:30 <DuB`> Make babies
23:27:32 <Camail> well, we fuck
23:27:32 <DuB`> ;D
23:27:44 <Crisium> will dub marry shane
23:27:49 <Camail> also she makes food
23:27:51 <Zounds_> always sounds like you guys are doing all the work though
23:27:56 <Camail> we tried to get skram to marry shane
23:28:03 <Crisium> shane is my fav dude
23:28:08 <Camail> wives do various things
23:28:12 <Zounds_> in this day and age is it really up to one side to pitch all the woo
23:29:28 <Camail> well, they're just being themselves
23:30:12 <Camail> and if you happen to waif them, that's cool
23:30:52 <Zounds_> It's more prior to marriage I'm worried about
23:31:18 <Zounds_> Like, you gotta constantly give gifts and do stuff or whatever for her so she falls in love
23:31:23 <Zounds_> why doesn't she do anything
23:31:28 <Crisium> they give gifts back form time to time
23:31:39 <Zounds_> See, that's good
23:31:49 <Zounds_> (not that I really mind either way...games gonna game)
23:32:11 <Crisium> Zounds is this game not up to your modern sensibilities of chivalry equality
23:33:07 <Camail> if you want a real answer, it's an inherited gameplay mechanic from harvest moon
23:33:17 <Zounds_> It's just funny the way games handle relationships
23:33:44 <Zounds_> I remember in SW:TOR Just handing hundreds of items to a guy so he love me

23:33:55 <Dot> skrm <3
23:34:05 <skrm> Dot <3
23:34:18 <Camail> games cant make the other party an agent in the relationships because that either railroads all interactions with them, or causes a ton more work to make more open situations
23:34:34 <Zounds_> I know, I'm really not complaining
23:34:42 <Camail> tho players can marry each other
23:34:50 <Zounds_> It's just funny to imagine something like that
23:35:07 <Camail> yea, we make the jokes during the game too
23:35:14 <Camail> i went into her house, proposed, then left
23:35:22 <Crisium> lol
23:35:25 <Camail> not the flashiest moment
23:35:44 <Camail> the most important part is that i won
23:35:47 <Crisium> those potatos arent gonna harvest themselves
23:36:02 <Camail> they actually will
23:36:11 <Zounds_> sorcery
23:36:11 <Camail> once we get the right stuff
23:36:17 <Camail> yes, magic
23:36:52 <Crisium> crops make all the money, but animal husbandry is the most fun
23:37:14 <Crisium> i mean, ducks
23:37:19 <Crisium> how are ducks not awesome
23:37:38 <Dot> you need to be full Peak District, all stone walls and sheep
23:38:32 <Camail> i just got 10 farming so we're gonna make bank preserving stuff in the winter
