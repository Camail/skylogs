08:21:22 <Camail> he is hooked up to wifi but doesnt want to set anything up because he'd impose on his hosts
08:21:42 <Camail> its just that he's really far away from the wifi router and the quality is garbage

21:28:49 <Camail> Runbunny  that was fun
21:29:37 <Runbunny> Yeah, I thought we'd meet tougher enemies.
21:29:57 <Runbunny> but it was really decent actually.
21:30:55 <Camail> the third one was the closest
21:31:08 <Camail> i think if we played another we'd face good players
21:31:14 <Camail> i dunno why they loved tri so much tho
21:32:39 <Camail> thats about my limit for quake tho, my hand is in tatters

22:14:21 <Camail> man MHA is so good
22:29:04 <Bio> i did a nap then got a sammich
22:31:27 <reification> how organised bio
22:42:40 <DuB`> I had some ice cream and did a nap.
22:42:45 <DuB`> And now it is WAY TOO HOT.
22:45:39 <Camail> fan yourself
22:45:55 <Camail> dub  i did some 2v2s and it was so much better
22:45:58 <Camail> sooooo much better
22:49:08 <DuB`> Yeah fo sho
22:49:25 <skrm> go dunk urself in the BAY
22:49:27 <DuB`> Hadn't been a party leader before so I didn't even know we were headed for 4v4 :P
22:49:58 <DuB`> I did put wifi extender in better spot
22:50:25 <DuB`> Speed is like 40% better but now literally turns off for 10 seconds once ever 15min or so :P
22:50:33 <DuB`> every*
22:53:02 <Camail> https://testmy.net/
22:53:04 <Camail> test on here
22:53:24 <Camail> it's the best speed test site i've used
22:53:24 -!- tredc [~AdiIRC@c83-251-163-99.bredband.comhem.se] has joined #tlponies
22:57:28 <Camail> wifi is complicated
22:57:44 <Camail> is your wifi extender extending the right frequency
22:58:00 <Camail> 2.4 GHz is what you want
22:58:23 <DuB`> Think so
23:04:09 <Camail> the only other thing i can think of to solve general wifi problems is reducing the number of dense things in between the wifi and you, but i dont think that's an option
23:04:19 <Camail> then again, it can still be an issue of conneciton quality
23:04:38 <Camail> so the speed is better but it can still be unstable, just not enough to DC most of the time
23:44:05 <reification> night all
23:44:33 <Dot> gnight reif
