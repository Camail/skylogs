21:20:48 <skram> DuB`
21:20:52 <skram> how 2 stellaris
21:24:21 <Phearlock> What you having trouble with skram? I got some hours in the new patch
21:24:44 <Phearlock> Can give bad advice
21:25:22 <Dot> skram is a space man now?
21:25:37 <Phearlock> Maybe a space mushroom
21:25:41 <Phearlock> You can choose
21:26:03 <Dot> skram probably picked the fox's
21:26:14 <Phearlock> the foxes are cute!
21:29:25 <Dot> skram has good taste
21:32:02 <Runbunny> Space foxes?
21:37:30 <skram> no im owlface
21:38:03 <Camail> so many space bois
21:38:12 <Camail> i should look up gameplay trialers of stellaris
21:38:14 <Phearlock> Colonize the fuck out of anything above 60%. Build a second sience ship early on for exploring and sweet survey bonuses.
21:38:16 <Camail> is it a 4x?
21:38:22 <Phearlock> it is
21:38:31 <Camail> ah, darn
21:38:45 <Phearlock> Slow paced RTS
21:38:56 <Camail> i've bought so many 4x games and never get more than an hour into any of them
21:39:14 <Camail> they are so damn cool and hook me so hard
21:39:22 <Camail> then i just drift awaaaaaay
21:39:48 <Dot> pew pew lasers
21:40:03 <Dot> though i actually find railguns cooler nowdays
21:40:13 <Camail> magnets
21:40:42 <Dot> magnets!
21:41:06 <Phearlock> You kinda want both in stellaris
21:41:53 <Phearlock> Also skram the default corvettes come with point defense and it's not that common for things to spam missiles early. So redesign them to 1 railgun 2 lasers.
21:42:07 <Phearlock> much better for actually killing things
21:43:57 <skram> im trying to figure out what the buttons do
21:44:14 <Phearlock> There is a tutorial
21:44:31 <skram> im doin it
21:45:04 <Phearlock> yay
21:49:47 <DuB`>  skram is spess!
21:49:48 <DuB`> Wew
21:50:06 <DuB`> Game is extra hard as of this week, update complicated everything :P
21:51:22 <Phearlock> My corporation game is going nicely
21:51:38 <Phearlock> I have all the money

22:36:24 <DuB`> nn dot!
22:36:32 <DoT|Phone> gl being a space empire Skram
22:36:57 <DoT|Phone> or space village. depending on your ambition
22:37:29 <DoT|Phone> dub <3
22:44:22 <skram> village is enough

23:04:13 <Phearlock> this is great
23:04:19 <DuB`> Hahaha

23:04:49 <Phearlock> so scary
23:04:56 <skram> i dont know?
23:05:17 <skram> actually im still on the tutorial so dont know if theres baddies in this
23:05:33 <DuB`> Aha
23:05:38 <Phearlock> Baddies depends on perspective really
23:05:47 <Phearlock> except for a few edge cases =P
23:06:00 <Camail> the edge cases where everyone you disagree with is killed
23:06:57 <skram> i havent met anyone else yet
23:07:35 <Phearlock> Like if you're a ruthless slaver conglomerate
23:07:55 <Phearlock> the other authoritarian materalistic races will think you're a great guy and want to hang out with you
23:08:06 <Phearlock> While the democratic xenophiles maybe not so much
23:08:31 <skram> oh hey i just met some guy who was like leave me alone ok
23:08:42 <skram> i think he likes me because we're all good christian birdpeople
23:08:48 <DuB`> lolol
23:09:11 <DuB`> And Gestalt Consciousness AI don't give a hoot, you are just a dumb meatbag that needs to be integrated
23:09:52 <Phearlock> Not always true, if you embrace cybernetic enhancements for your people they might think you're being pretty cool
23:10:09 <DuB`> Only because you've done the first steps FOR them! :P
23:10:32 <Phearlock> Though if they're the borg AI or Exterminator AI's, yeah they still don't really like you
23:10:39 <DuB`> I guess I'm thinking specifically of the Drivin Assimilator type
23:10:47 <DuB`> Haha
23:12:27 <Phearlock> The rogue custodian AI are really nice most of the time
23:12:37 <DuB`> Yes
23:13:20 <DuB`> I ran into one lost in space, one thing led to another, and he has been efficiently leading my megacorp for decades now! :P
23:15:32 <Phearlock> How nice =)

23:19:45 <Phearlock> =(
23:20:48 <DuB`> The "one neighbor" is  a former federation member and protectorate who went through a rebellious phase and went a bit genocidal against a neighboring AI empire...

23:31:23 <Camail> dub if everyone you know is a criminal...are you a crime boy as well?
23:31:31 <Camail> do you do the crimes!
23:31:35 <Camail> you have to tell the truth
23:32:22 <DuB`> If your corporation is the literally the one making the laws it's hard for your corporation to break the laws. ;D
