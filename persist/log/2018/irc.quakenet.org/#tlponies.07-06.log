21:20:08 <skram> why!
21:20:25 <Dot> infecting stolen blood with cancer probably
21:21:08 <Runbunny> actually was it transfecting stolen blood with GFP.
21:21:17 <Runbunny> I don't think you get cancer from that.
21:21:30 <Runbunny> I am fairly certain.
21:26:18 <skram> why are you putting flourenscent proteins in things runbun
21:26:20 <skram> are you having a rave
21:26:30 <skram> also do they work in people
21:26:54 <Dot> is he making ppl into glowsticks?
21:27:02 <skram> i think so

22:11:14 <Runbunny> well it's a protein.
22:11:21 <Runbunny> So yeah it "works" on people
22:11:34 <skram> but does it make you glow
22:12:47 <Runbunny> Sure, if you shine light with the right wavelength on it.
22:15:06 <skram> can you put it in my arm so we can test in runbun
22:15:51 <Dot> then we need a strobe with the right wave length light
22:16:05 <Runbunny> I suggest a laser.
22:17:10 <skram> whats the right wave lengt anders
22:17:16 <skram> is it on the visible spectrum
22:17:21 <Runbunny> Yes.
22:17:31 <Runbunny> It's like 480 or something
22:17:57 <skram> so blue light then
22:18:04 <skram> to make me glow green?
22:18:06 <skram> useless
22:18:30 <Runbunny> Not glow.
22:18:39 <Runbunny> More like shine green.
22:19:33 <skram> do you have proteins the emit light when absorbing ultraviolet light anders
22:19:35 <skram> thats what i want
22:22:22 <Runbunny> Nah. sorry. I think what you want is luminescent proteins.
22:22:37 <Runbunny> They glow just by themselves.
22:23:06 <skram> perfect
22:23:10 <skram> where do i get them
22:23:52 <Runbunny> Algae somewhere.
22:24:01 <skram> very helpful
