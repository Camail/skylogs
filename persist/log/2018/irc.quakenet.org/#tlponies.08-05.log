00:01:03 <Dot> which is good news

00:08:37 <DvB`> hi
00:08:41 <Dot> hi
00:11:15 <skram> hi
00:13:38 <Dot> dub, if you need DnD notes i can link you the oneNote doc i have, once you have internet
00:16:21 <Dot> skram! you like lego
00:16:28 <skram> dot
00:16:32 <skram> i fucking LOVE lego
00:16:44 <Dot> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWgTRHH656Y
00:16:59 <Dot> saw this a few days ago
00:17:04 <skram> ...Im already subscribed to this guy :P
00:17:14 <skram> very impressive though
00:17:17 <Dot> i expected you might be
00:17:29 <Dot> but still meant to show you when i saw it
00:17:39 <skram> I was thinking about buying the big maersk container ship
00:17:49 <skram> but it says it does not float so whats the point
00:18:16 <Dot> well with some waterproofing custom work maybe it can
00:18:46 <skram> well sure but that sort of defeats the purpose a bit
00:19:11 <skram> i could steal some gasket goo from work but i'd never get it apart again
00:19:41 <Dot> find some none permanant way
00:19:54 <Dot> and why are you taking it apart?
00:20:09 <skram> why not!

21:54:14 <Zounds> most characters have more ways to open people up these days too
21:54:23 <Zounds> and chip damage is higher on blocks
21:54:35 <Zounds> plus you don't regen at low hp anymore
21:54:38 <Runbunny> They fixed the game.
21:54:47 <Runbunny> Sounds like.
21:54:50 <Zounds> Shugoki still doesn't have much tools
21:54:55 <Zounds> but he is considered the weakest
21:55:14 <Zounds> just feint heavies into gb all day long on him
21:55:32 <Zounds> untill you just let a heavy fly for the luls and it catches them off guard
21:58:33 <Runbunny> Used to be like unblockable 80% combo.
21:58:40 <Runbunny> Or something like that.

22:16:05 <Phearlock_> Nah sing quit
22:16:08 <Bio> sing hasn't played dotes in months
22:16:17 <Bio> dendi still plays tho
22:16:28 <Bio> he's literally still on Na'Vi
22:16:34 <Phearlock_> Sing is general game streamer personality now.
22:16:34 <Bio> they just didn't make TI
22:17:22 <skram> well dendi did show up last TI
