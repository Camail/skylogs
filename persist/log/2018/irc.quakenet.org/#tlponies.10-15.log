00:50:27 <carcinization> night all
00:55:27 <Crisium> nn
01:59:48 <Camail> DuB`  what's the easiest third conquest
02:00:14 <Camail> beause that's the only thing i have to do other than farm for lvl 70 gems which is really easy
02:00:31 <Camail> the 8 set dungeons seems awful
02:05:11 <Camail> the speed run is meh...but i also dont want to play hardcore
02:07:12 <Camail> meh, the easiest is probably the setless 45
02:09:32 <DuB`> I think I remember doing that one, yeah
02:13:32 <Camail> the 20 bosses was fun
02:15:34 <DuB`> That doesn't even need to be solo, right?
02:15:39 <Camail> dont think so
02:15:43 <DuB`> ez
02:15:55 <Camail> none of them need to be solo
02:16:25 <Camail> honestly the only hard part about the boss rush was making sure to have movement speed and getting through the maps
02:16:33 <Camail> for a crus, that's a bit of a challenge
02:18:22 <skram> crusaders have that thing that makes you go nyooom
02:22:16 <Camail> yea i ended up using the steed
02:22:35 <Camail> but its still not very fast for very long
02:24:16 <DuB`> I have rolled a solid 6000bs for triumvirate offhand -.-;
02:24:45 <Camail> git gud?
02:24:54 <Camail> try upgrading source orbs
02:25:01 <Camail> or w/e they're called
02:25:14 <DuB`> They're only 25bs, would rather just go through that :T
02:26:00 <Camail> well its only fair
02:26:13 <Camail> your luck is all gone
02:26:21 <skram> srsly
02:30:33 <DuB`> fair fair

05:44:49 <Camail> oh god, dub i tried to make my own build for the setless 40gr, took it for a spin in t10 rift because its the same level...
05:44:58 <Camail> hammerdin really super doesnt work without the set
05:45:01 <DuB`> :o
05:45:02 <DuB`> Hahaha
05:45:15 <Camail> guess i have to build the thorns pieces...sigh
05:45:34 <Camail> i did ok! like, i didnt get my ass blasted as hard as i thought i would
05:45:47 <Camail> especially because i just cobbled it together with stuff i had
05:45:51 <DuB`> Yeah
05:45:54 <Camail> but boy did i not do enough damage
05:46:07 <DuB`> I remember saving all sorts of ancient legendaries that I found with good effects for a while before doing that
05:46:13 <Camail> its weird going from doing 300b minimum to doing 100m
05:53:03 <DuB`> I made some adjustments and have much better damage now
05:53:17 <DuB`> Sacrifices some toughness to be just shy of invincibility :P
