13:00:34 <carcinisation> any experts with opinions about this monitor? https://www.ebuyer.com/797222-acer-kg271abmidpx-27-full-hd-led-gaming-monitor-um-hx1ee-a05
13:01:23 <skram> 230 pound sterling for a 27" 144hz monitor?
13:01:26 <skram> thats hella cheap reifmannen
13:01:42 <carcinisation> looking for 27" 144hz freesync
13:02:01 <carcinisation> it does seem cheaper than others
13:03:28 <Dot`> is a TN panel type and not a IPS, but IPS are genraly more expensive and its hard to find one with a 1ms reponse
13:05:27 <carcinisation> i shouldn't have a problem with view angle and not doing print work etc. so colour perfection not vital
13:05:37 <carcinisation> but do care about price/gaming
13:05:46 <carcinisation> so TN seems the fix

17:25:23 <Cane> God damn. Biggest mistake I made recently was nabbing the name "Cane" on Epic Launcher. With Fortnite being more popular than god I get about 50 friend requests and a bunch of messages a day asking fori t.
17:26:26 <Cane> canef and Cane26, pls go poke someone else.
17:27:22 <Cane> It wouldn't be so bad if this shitty launcher had batch operations.
17:35:26 <Cane> Alright, I've cleaned the computer and the connectors of the GPU. Now installing latest drivers.
17:35:42 <Cane> Time to find out if my GPU is actually fried or if it's salvageable.
17:38:58 <DoT|Phone> gl cane!
17:39:35 <Cane> Man, nVidia really wants me to install their shitty Experience software.

21:27:41 <Camail> the daily today is amazing
21:27:45 <Camail> only like 1 hour left
21:28:15 <Camail> but once you get to act 2 you can have a build that 1 shots every single monster and boss
21:28:35 <Camail> it's incredibly easy to get a nearly perfect score
23:05:32 <carcinisation> thanks for the heads up cam, that was a blast
23:06:14 <Camail> yea, steam isnt connecting for me so i cant check the leaderboard, but its worth doing just to get the synergy
23:06:42 <Camail> the best part is not upgrading one of the mind blasts and using it for the necronomicon 
23:06:58 <Camail> so you're doing 600 damage turn 1 at the end
23:07:11 <Camail> the only real challenge is the act 1 boss
23:08:41 <carcinisation> yep with necro i was 2dmg from 1card killing the final boss
23:09:23 <Camail> i ran it two times because the runs only take 15 minutes
23:09:59 <Camail> the first run i took the slime boss relic, which was a big mistake
23:10:11 <Camail> cant get those collector points if you do that
23:10:47 <Camail> i ended up taking the one that reduces for card choices because i didnt care what i was picking up anyway
23:10:55 <Camail> reduces your*
23:29:51 <carcinisation> night all
