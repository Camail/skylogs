01:39:22 <Camail> skram  i listened to all of TAZ, it was really fun
01:39:29 <Camail> i wouldn't say it was dnd, but it was fun
01:57:10 <skram> ya they changed to a different system in season 2
01:57:15 <skram> did you cry at the end tho

02:20:04 <Camail> i i didnt watch any season 2 yet, dunno if i will
02:20:26 <Camail> but i didn't literally cry, but it was pretty emotional
02:20:39 <Camail> to coolest part was how they were able to make you care about characters retroactively
02:23:12 <skram> yeah
02:24:22 <skram> i really enjoyed how all the arcs sorta came together in the 3rd to last arc and how the second to last arc really explored the characters
02:25:54 <skram> could've been pretty deus ex-ish or gimmicky and i suppose its a bit cliche-y but it was really enjoyable

17:51:52 <skram> hows the world of crafts
17:51:57 <CockRoach|42> DoT`: very accurate gif
17:58:20 <Zounds> its okay skram
17:58:57 <Zounds> though outside of mythics and waiting for raids there isn't much to do but waste time
18:02:59 <skram> ye true
18:03:03 <skram> world quests though
18:07:34 <Zounds> they don't really engage the brain D:
18:07:38 <Zounds> good for rep though
18:08:09 <skram> ya i still havent unlocked the last dungeon
18:08:24 <skram> i just cba do do the friggin world quests
18:09:33 <Zounds> make sure to do your weekly island expedition things for the 1.5k 7th legion equivalent rep (Honorbound maybe for horde?)
18:09:45 <skram> aye
18:12:17 <Zounds> Raid opens next week
18:13:01 <Zounds> That should be good
18:20:59 <Zounds> Does every profession except Herb + Alchemy suck again in BFA like Legion
18:21:05 <Zounds> Cuz Engineering seems really bad
18:21:19 <skram> tailoring has cool items once you do 30 mythics
18:21:29 <skram> and a cloak enchant that makes you not dazed
18:21:31 <skram> thats about it
18:21:43 <Zounds> Engie gets 340 helm with not even BiS Azerite traits u_u
18:21:49 <Zounds> That you need to do mythics to even get the mats for
18:21:53 <Zounds> = ???????
18:22:14 <skram> has the engineering goggles ever been good
18:22:18 <skram> maybe ok in tbc
18:22:34 <Zounds> I'm still engie for glider cloak and nitro boost belt
18:22:37 <Zounds> same shit since WotLK
18:22:56 <skram> wotlk had good craftables
18:23:02 <skram> at least in tailoring
18:23:16 <Zounds> Yeah, 10 saronite bars for a repair bot wasn't bad
18:23:23 <skram> a few BiS items that you could actually make some money making
18:24:08 <Zounds> Engie also had glove enchants and engie specific gems

18:26:57 <skram> yep
18:27:05 <skram> inscription is completely useless now
18:27:18 <Zounds> Yep, my mage is a scribe
18:27:21 <Zounds> bigget waste of time ever
18:27:56 <Zounds> The level 91 craftable staff that had level 100 heroic stats were good in WoD
18:28:08 <Zounds> Glyphs have become mostly pointless for making money
18:28:37 <Zounds> Vantus Runes - does anybody use these? total min maxers maybe
18:28:54 <skram> well you can make tomes
18:28:58 <skram> thats about it
18:29:57 <Zounds> Those can be convenient yeah
18:30:30 <Zounds> Flasks might be quite expensive this expac
18:30:33 <Zounds> Anchor weed is hard to find
18:30:58 <Zounds> hopefully the sheer volume of herbalists means there will be a decent amount going around though
