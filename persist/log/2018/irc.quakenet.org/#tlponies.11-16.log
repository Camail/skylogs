15:25:30 <skrm> did you get A PLANT
15:26:19 <Dot> i almost did
15:26:50 <Dot> instead i got a few small things, like mugs and 2 bowls, and got a bathroom mirror thing and a kallax for books
15:33:31 <Dot> and some nice curtians and curtain rails
15:33:37 <Dot> the reason i went there
15:46:41 <skrm> noice
15:46:53 <skrm> kallax are great for LP records
15:46:56 <skrm> they fit perfectly
16:00:09 <skrm> did you put up your new curtains yet Dot

16:03:49 <skrm> good times
16:04:59 <Dot> sunday is curtains AND DnD
16:05:02 <Dot> what a day
16:06:35 <skrm> what a blessed life we live dot
16:08:36 <skrm> There was a person here who dropped a literal truckload of garbage on the dang floor several meters from the chute you're supposed to tip into
16:09:22 <skrm> And he was here about 2 weeks ago and did the SAME FUCKIN THING, at which point he was informed he was an idiot
16:09:50 <Dot> thats not good H&S
16:10:37 <skrm> I wanted to tell him to fuck off and never come back but apparently thats too mean so I had to write the most passive agressive HSE rapport I could
16:11:59 <skrm> Fuckin idiot had the gall to tell me the hydraulics were faulty but only when not in the middle of the goddamn floor
