00:16:07 <DuB`> Heheh
00:16:20 <DuB`> Just got my spotify student discount extended to 2020
00:16:31 <DuB`> Graduating in the spring of 2019, but I'll take it :P
00:17:30 <Phearlock> Nice =D
00:17:48 <Phearlock> I am getting all the space refugees right now
00:17:53 <Phearlock> Huge war in the galactic north
00:18:05 <Phearlock> (more workers yaaay)
00:18:30 <DuB`> :D
00:18:50 <DuB`> I learned a bit too late how to make branch offices and now all the lucrative planets are already taken :(
00:18:51 <skram> i accidentally told the pirate boys to fuck off and then they showed up with a fleet like 5x more powerful than mine and ruined everything
00:19:00 <DuB`> Oopsie
00:19:32 <Phearlock> Lol same dub
00:19:40 <Phearlock> Also yeah the marauder nations are fucking nasty early on
00:19:47 <Phearlock> just gotta pay them mostly
00:20:09 <DuB`> You can also turn down the modifier for the number that spawn on game creation, ez :P
00:20:17 <Phearlock> I like them
00:20:32 <Phearlock> They're quite handy if you make a lot of money
00:20:35 <Phearlock> mercs!

01:04:14 <Bio> bois
01:04:15 <Bio> hi
01:04:24 <DuB`> bios
01:04:24 <DuB`> hi
01:05:18 <Bio> imma play some S M A S H B R O S
01:20:51 <Camail> woo
01:20:55 <Camail> finally slayed the spire
01:21:10 <Camail> calipers single handedly carried me
01:21:23 <Phearlock> Yay =D
01:21:45 <Phearlock> I have 1 act 4 win but struggling to unlock the higher acensions =P
01:21:54 <Phearlock> (higher = more than 4)
01:23:03 <Camail> i have all my ppl at asc 10+ now, but i've only even gotten close to killing the heart this one time
01:23:18 <Camail> having an act 3 build is so much different than having an act 4 build
01:23:55 <Phearlock> It really is
01:24:17 <Camail> also i have grown to genuinely enjoy the pyramid that makes you never discard cards
01:24:26 <Phearlock> Oh that thing is super strong
01:24:47 <Camail> it makes combat math actually engaging
01:24:59 <Camail> where timing is rewarded, not just playing your most valuable sequence each turn
01:25:20 <Phearlock> yeah, lets you plan ahead a lot more
01:25:33 <Camail> but wounds dont get discarded so fighting anything that gives you wounds is terrible if you cant get rid of them
01:25:43 <Camail> i had a wound in my hand the entire heart fight...
01:29:17 <Camail> now i need to beat it on the other 2
01:29:24 <Camail> my silent play is...not great
01:29:44 <Phearlock> Silent is probably my favorite class
01:30:11 <Camail> i'm defect>ironclad>silent
01:30:22 <Phearlock> But yeah my heart kill was Ironclad too
01:30:38 <Camail> ironclad is the easiest to play
01:30:47 <Camail> but i also just like big strength and big vulnerable
01:31:44 <Phearlock> Big strength is mega fun
01:31:58 <Phearlock> my heart kill was the classic exhaust synergy thing though
01:32:26 <Phearlock> Corruption, 2 feel no pain+, barricade, some stuff.
01:32:52 <Phearlock> Hit like 500 armor on turn 2 and it was pretty chill from there
01:33:17 <Phearlock> good draws =P
01:38:15 <Camail> i've never done a corruption build, i never wanna risk it, because each individual piece is kinda garbage
01:38:41 <Camail> but every synergy you add multiplies the value, especially dead branch
01:41:17 <Phearlock> Corruption is not really that risky as you don't have to play it everytime but it makes the latter end, or later on the entire fight a breeze
01:42:10 <Camail> yea but you risk just having a dead card, and that's never fun
01:42:47 <Camail> i do want to make another barricade + body slam deck
01:43:32 <Phearlock> Yeee
01:44:05 <Phearlock> Barricade is much harder to pick up than corruption but if you can get it just as you have a strong enough mitigation engine it just wins =D
01:44:31 <Camail> i feel like you only take it if you already have the defense to support it
01:44:37 <Camail> or at least are like, 80% there
01:45:02 <Phearlock> yeah
01:46:42 <Camail> i think i've one at least once with every archtype of each character, other than combos
01:46:57 <Camail> i have never had a single combo in all of my runs
01:48:14 <Camail> oh, apparently i have a 5 win streak on defect this week
01:48:29 <Camail> do dailies count?
01:50:13 <Camail> ah, yes it does
02:33:40 <Runbunny> DuB`, https://imgur.com/gallery/gZa1kSF
02:39:14 <Phearlock> Camail you seem to bring good luck. Just did a run after talking and got an ascension 3 silent win.
02:39:23 <Camail> nice!
02:39:34 <Camail> what deck was it
02:39:51 <Camail> Runbunny  that bird is mean
02:40:04 <Camail> also go to sleep!
02:40:12 <Runbunny> I should.
02:40:27 <Camail> too much PoE will rot your brain
02:40:28 <Runbunny> Dub is one for mean birds.
02:40:35 <Runbunny> Yes.
02:40:36 <Camail> he IS a mean bird
02:40:41 <Camail> with a bunch of punk space friends
02:40:47 <Camail> prolly in a gang, too
02:40:48 <Phearlock> Actually no real combos or anything. Just some fairly good synergy and a versatile enough deck to not be too threatened by most of the fights as long as the draws went well.
02:40:56 <Phearlock> Had a lot of small synergy everywhere
02:41:09 <Phearlock> 2 skewers + chemical x carried earlygame
02:41:17 <Runbunny> Mean space bird in a gang.
02:41:25 <Runbunny> Sounds like Dub to me.
02:41:26 <Phearlock> regular fumes+afterimage+footwork for just longevity
02:42:11 <Camail> chemical x is probably the strongest new-ish relic they've added
02:42:13 <Phearlock> And orange pellets relic + wraith form + well laid plans so had a 3 turn intangible that didn't really drain my dex
02:42:30 <Camail> nice
02:42:33 <Phearlock> I was so looking for a malaise the entire run
02:42:36 <Phearlock> but never found one ;_;
02:42:51 <Phearlock> but hey good enough deck to win it so xD
02:42:57 <Camail> haha, yea you never get the rare you really want
02:46:14 <Camail> hmm, the heart doesnt gain much for asc 19
02:46:52 <Camail> i guess making te stabbing pain 2 hp rather than 1 can ruin a build
03:02:55 <DuB`> I held a 2 week old puppy
03:03:15 <DuB`> That was the most therapeutic 30 minutes I've had in weeks!
03:21:57 <Phearlock> awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
03:32:14 <DuB`> It did a yawn-n-stretch and I almost exploded.
03:50:51 <Camail> ugh, i'm surprised i lost my mm rank, i really doesn't feel like it's been that long
04:08:42 <Runbunny> oh right
04:08:43 <Runbunny> sleep.
04:46:42 <Camail> wow, i played with lem and supremes, and no one commed at all?
04:48:38 <Camail> but was win, so that's fine

09:47:17 <Camail> hi dot
09:47:37 <Camail> sts is such a good game

09:48:44 <Camail> that will take awhile tho
09:49:14 <DoT|Phone> I think I would get a bit from it. but not nearly as much as you
09:49:41 <Camail> this game is for anyone who enjoys mtg but doesnt want to play against humans

14:16:09 <skram> I did a christmas shopping and got a book about DWARVES.
14:16:14 <skram> its been a good day.
14:16:46 <DoT|Phone> this is great
14:17:52 <skram> considered getting the dnd players manual but its 50 pounds dude
14:18:36 <Micen_> how much is shipping between the states and you skram, any idea? 
14:19:02 <skram> depends
14:19:18 <skram> somewhere between somewhat reasonable and hella
14:19:24 <Micen_> because the phb is on sale for 20 here and if its less with shipping i would be willing to order it and send it off. 
14:19:29 <Micen_> 20usd that is
14:20:09 <skram> Yeah for a proper book its probably at least another 20 in shipping
14:20:31 <DoT|Phone> 50?
14:20:41 <skram> thats a lot of work for 10 dollarydoos of savings but i appreciate the offer <3
14:20:41 <DoT|Phone> I got it for just under 30
14:21:25 <skram> norway is expensive ok
14:22:27 <Micen_> Dot, buy Skram a book and walk it over
14:22:38 <Micen_> EU is small right? Thats a doable thing
14:22:51 <skram> sort of
14:23:00 <skram> need a boat though
14:23:23 <DoT|Phone> Skram can fly here and buy the book and it will work out cheaper
14:23:54 <skram> i mean you could walk to france, then through belgium and holland and germany to denmark, then cross to sweden and then its just a short jaunt up to oslo and ill get you a train ticket for the last bit
14:25:35 <DoT|Phone> minor inconvenience of the English channel
14:25:43 <CockRoach|42> there's a tunnel

14:26:07 <skram> #BringBackPangea
14:26:21 <Micen_> See Skram get it!
14:26:41 <CockRoach|42> or wait a few years until a new pangea is formed
14:27:17 <skram> the spotify wrapped thing is my favorite time of year
14:28:16 <skram> i guess its been a good year because theres almost no sadtimes music on it
14:33:27 <DoT|Phone> any songs about fire?
