02:16:24 <Phearlock_> I won a sea battle with 1 hp left today. I blame missing 8 55% shots in a row.
02:18:57 <Phearlock_> I want a bigger boat.
02:19:02 <Phearlock_> Gold though.
02:19:47 <Camail> I'm not sure how i feel about boat fights
02:20:04 <Camail> also i kinda fought a ton of merchants and maybe pissed off the pirates witohut realizing it
02:21:22 <Phearlock_> They're a nice enough minigame but can get a bit drawn out.
02:23:08 <Camail> boarding is annoying, it's so much quicker to kill the ship
02:23:17 <Camail> unless you have 2-3 aoe party members
02:23:29 <Phearlock_> Yup that's what I figured as well
02:25:32 <Phearlock_> Are you hoarding cats and dogs too?
02:25:41 <Phearlock_> I have a lot of cats and dogs
02:27:07 <Camail> i have a pig
02:27:22 <Camail> there's a pet shop in the big city
02:27:29 <Camail> the pig i have reduces stun time by 30%
02:27:34 <Camail> he's a very good pig
02:27:35 <Phearlock_> Oh I haven't even been there yet.
02:27:47 <Phearlock_> I guess I could get more pets...
02:27:52 <Camail> yea pets give party-wide bonuses, it's sick
02:28:01 <Camail> there's like 20+ pets to buy
02:28:28 <Phearlock_> In bed now
02:28:44 <Phearlock_> More explorin tomorrow
02:28:49 <Camail> so much exploring
02:35:58 <Camail> poe1 was a labor of love, so far poe2 seems like a labor of love with more money
02:36:03 <Camail> which is what i wantedddddd

17:37:33 <Golly> found a bard type and the game was like, you put up the order of the songs yourself
17:37:38 <Golly> and i was like durfrrrr
17:37:43 <DuB`> Oh dear
17:38:46 <Golly> some people love that stuff, I just feel like im playing suboptimally 
17:39:20 <Phearlock> You have enough room to optimize a bit without having to micromanage everything.
17:39:57 <Golly> i seem to remember healing was a bit strange as well
17:40:22 <Phearlock> It had a combat hp and total hp, you could only heal the total hp by resting and some few skills.
17:40:35 <Phearlock> while in combat healing restored your endurance (combat hp).
17:40:48 <Golly> right
17:41:05 <Phearlock> Pillars 2 does away with that system and it's all just "you have this much hp and you get it back after combat if you're still alive"
17:41:19 <Phearlock> and healing just heals that
17:49:19 <Golly> that does sound better for my liking

20:13:48 <Camail> good good
20:14:01 <Camail> have you palyed oldschool RPGs before dub
20:14:49 <Dot`> yea cam, i never finished it yet though
20:15:01 <Camail> dooooot its so good tho
20:15:17 <Camail> pillars 2 has got me all hyped up again
20:17:49 <Dot`> it is good
20:27:19 <Camail> I found a sam riegal character
20:27:38 <Camail> sam's voice is the hardest for me to recognize
20:34:31 <DuB`> Don think so, cam
20:36:34 <Camail> it's gonna be very similar to dnd
20:36:57 <Camail> pillars uses d100 instead of d20 tho
20:37:17 <Camail> and combat is entirely roll based, with modifiers for offense and defense
20:37:22 <Camail> but on the surface its just dnd
20:40:11 <Camail> the only class that you won't be familiar with is cipher
20:40:50 <Camail> they build their resource by hitting people
20:42:20 <Camail> other than that, any particular questions you have just ask

21:22:22 <Phearlock> Oh I was wondering why it was chugging at some parts. Thanks for the tip
21:25:57 <Phearlock> I found this bow Frostseeker. Seems stupidly OP
21:27:18 <Phearlock> 4-9 base damage +25% freeze, fires 3 projectiles. Deals about 20-25 AOE Freeze/slash damage on a crit.
21:27:37 <Phearlock> (for each crit)
21:28:04 <Camail> nice
21:28:47 <Camail> DuB`  another thing, probably the biggest weird thing, is that in poe1 equipment bonuses don't stack, so if you have a +1 might and a +2 might then only the+2 might applies
21:28:57 <Camail> luckily that's not a thing in poe2

23:03:58 <Runbunny> Yes.
23:06:23 <DuB`> I can't do BOTH!
23:06:28 <DuB`> I'd overdose on Fantasy.
23:07:05 <Camail> catching up is more important
23:07:11 <Camail> dont want to get into the hole again
23:07:25 <Camail> even tho poe is sooo goood, it can wait
23:07:29 <DuB`> I could just watch four episodes in 2 days again ;D
23:07:35 <DuB`> I'm only one behind now
23:07:41 <Camail> didnt you say you didnt want to od on fantasy
23:07:55 <Camail> how is watching 16 hours of cr not making you froth at the mouth
23:08:10 <DuB`> It's the SIMULTANEOUS content!
23:08:11 <Camail> or play poe and listen to cr int he background
23:08:16 <Camail> do it
23:08:25 <Camail> then go to a ren fair
23:08:28 <DuB`> Haha
23:08:58 <Camail> both are good options, last weeks cr was really good tho
23:09:09 <Camail> and this weeks will be fun for live viewing
23:09:24 <Camail> also i discovered a weird ass bug in poe 2
23:09:38 <Camail> when you alt tab while its loading, upon load it will lock your mouse to whichever window you have focus on
23:09:46 <Camail> so my mouse is locked into my irc client
23:10:09 <Camail> the load times are kinda atrocious tho
23:16:22 <Phearlock> I know I've seen that bug before. But can't remember where.
23:43:12 <carcinisation> night all
23:48:27 <Dot`> gnight reif
