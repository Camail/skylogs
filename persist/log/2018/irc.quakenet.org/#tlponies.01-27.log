07:14:43 <skrm> WHATS UP WITH THAT
07:27:00 <DuB`> IT'S FRIDAY
07:27:01 <DuB`> ???
07:27:04 <DuB`> HI skrm
07:27:37 <skrm> HEY buddy
07:27:49 <skrm> how was the overwatches
07:28:06 <DuB`> Uh I dunno
07:28:14 <DuB`> I wasn't even half watching
07:28:15 <DuB`> like
07:28:20 <DuB`> 1/3rd watching
07:29:15 <skrm> how could you
07:29:26 <DuB`> There were
07:29:28 <DuB`> THINGS to read!
07:29:30 <DuB`> On the internet!
07:29:33 <DuB`> And
07:29:36 <DuB`> stuff
07:30:03 <Rawr|Phone> Dub skärpning
07:30:40 <DuB`> Is skarpning a fish
07:30:44 <DuB`> That sounds like a variety of fish
07:31:55 <Rawr|Phone> Sure
07:32:11 <DuB`> Probably not as tasty as tuna
07:32:30 <skrm> Tuna is great and all but salmon is the king of fishes
07:32:49 <DuB`> If tuna can be the queen, sure
07:33:20 <skrm> ...
07:33:26 <DuB`> MARRIED
07:33:26 <skrm> yeah that'll work
07:33:27 <DuB`> I ship it
07:33:40 <skrm> tuna-chan
07:33:42 <skrm> salmon-sama
07:33:51 <skrm> SUSHI ON ICE
07:33:53 <DuB`> Look how cute they are together http://zippys.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/teishoku-sashimi.png
07:34:21 <skrm> I have a GREAT idea for a new anime series
07:34:40 <DuB`> And now I'm hungry.
07:34:44 <DuB`> But it's midnight
07:34:52 <DuB`> and I only have CANNED tuna!
07:35:04 <Rawr|Phone> Go to bed instead dub
07:35:08 <skrm> canned tuna is vile
07:35:29 <DuB`> Right up until you have it like mayo 2:1 tuna
07:36:13 <skrm> well
07:36:17 <skrm> mayo is good for you
07:37:20 <DuB`> egg yolk, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, and one billion oil
07:37:22 <DuB`> All good stuff

07:38:33 <DuB`> o dear
07:39:18 <skrm> welcome to sweden
07:41:59 <DuB`> Seems dangerous
07:42:03 <DuB`> I'm worried for you, skram!
07:43:36 <skrm> Why :O
07:44:08 <DuB`> They are your neighbor!
07:44:37 <skrm> sweden is far away
07:44:47 <skrm> It would take me HOURS to get there
07:44:53 <skrm> like
07:44:54 <skrm> almost 3
07:45:21 <DuB`> It would take me more than 3 hours to get to my sister's apartment, and we're in the same state. ;D
07:45:29 <DuB`> But this is good, you should be safe then.
07:46:58 <skrm> My sister goes there once a month to buy cigarettes
07:47:05 <skrm> maybe I should warn her
07:48:39 <DuB`> When I hopefully do my grand tour of europe vacation in a two years or whatever I will keep this in mind
07:52:04 <skrm> You wanna buy cigarettes too? :P
07:52:37 <DuB`> ... nu
07:53:56 <skrm> Good, its a filthy habit
07:56:32 <skrm> I should do a travel this summer
07:57:16 <DuB`> And send a whole lotta pics
07:57:19 <skrm> Apparently I get 4 weeks this year and I havent had a proper vacation in like 10 years now
07:57:21 <DuB`> Like the florido ones!
07:57:29 <DuB`> oo  nice
08:00:09 <DuB`> Aw, dallas won
08:00:16 <DuB`> I wanted them to lose just for the lols
08:00:26 <skrm> :((
08:00:31 <DuB`> And because I'm bitter about envyus dominance for so long
08:01:02 <Camail> if it makes you feel better enyvus in csgo is a bunch of french bitch boys who haven't won in years
08:01:13 <skrm> Is that 12 year old gango main who played in c9 in the league still
08:01:59 <DuB`> Mendo?
08:02:02 <skrm> Well they were pretty dominant for like 4 months in 2015 or whenever
08:02:05 <skrm> yeah that guy
08:02:08 <DuB`> He's on houston but hasn't played once lol
08:02:10 <DuB`> Benchboi
08:02:57 <skrm> Wait who else on houston is better than him then
08:03:47 <skrm> ...I dont know any of these other DPS players
08:03:47 <DuB`> It's been jake/linkzr
08:04:10 <DuB`> Nobody is really sure why he's played 0 >_>
08:04:33 <skrm> Well he is swedish
08:04:46 <skrm> Maybe he broke his arm while making breakfast
08:05:06 <DuB`> I am now aware that this is a distinct possibility.
08:09:25 <skrm> Whats life without risk, DuB` 
08:09:53 <skrm> If breakfast doesnt make you face your own mortality then what are you doing
08:10:38 <DuB`> Eating bagels?
08:10:47 <DuB`> I'm okay with just bagels.
08:11:26 <skrm> sometimes i worry
08:19:44 <DuB`> skrm y wud u worry about bagels
08:21:08 <skrm> bagels just seem like a very sad food item
08:21:28 <DuB`> Nuh uh
08:21:39 <skrm> if you say so dear
08:21:41 <DuB`> Nice 'n toasted with a whole buncha slatherd cream cheese

13:59:08 <Yolteotl> ahah
13:59:12 <Yolteotl> april
13:59:14 <Yolteotl> probably
13:59:20 <ZK> although i did think you were more north than that
13:59:32 <ZK> heh, i moved to the netherlands a few months back :P
13:59:42 <ZK> well, officially moved at start of month
13:59:53 <Yolteotl> like you are not canadian anymore?!
14:00:29 <ZK> im still canadian!
14:00:34 <ZK> just not living there anymore :P
14:01:02 <Yolteotl> lies
14:01:09 <ZK> i have maple syrup
14:01:14 <ZK> you cant take that away from me
14:02:15 <Yolteotl> you steal our european jobs
14:03:04 <ZK> yes
14:03:10 <ZK> took it directly from another guy
14:03:25 <ZK> but its netherlands isnt starving for jobs like france
14:03:40 <ZK> actually importing people from all over here
14:04:04 <ZK> i meet french people all the time actually
14:04:29 <Yolteotl> :D
14:04:39 <ZK> they all lieave france3 cause no jobs there :(
14:04:43 <Yolteotl> yes, because netherland is stealing other countries hob :P
14:04:55 <Yolteotl> but France is fine now
14:05:01 <ZK> is it?
14:05:23 <ZK> your unemployment rate still at around 10%
14:06:12 <ZK> and you're still leaving :P
14:07:37 <ZK> Dot`: , masa vs serral is fun game
14:09:03 <Yolteotl> 10% is mainly for... "low qualified" (?) jobs
14:09:47 <Yolteotl> computer science is fine :p 
14:12:18 <ZK> well yea, thats fine everywhere in the world
14:12:26 <ZK> where and for what company in usa you goin
14:12:27 <ZK> ?
14:14:10 <Yolteotl> Thales, same company as now
14:14:15 <Yolteotl> but the USA part 
14:14:31 <Yolteotl> and Irvine in California :)
14:16:32 <ZK> oh, expensive!
14:16:49 <ZK> how much for your aparmtnet there? :P
14:17:03 <Yolteotl> *appartement ?
14:17:05 <Yolteotl> :P
14:18:53 <ZK> yes
14:19:06 <Yolteotl> it will be around 1600/2000 bucks
14:19:29 <Yolteotl> but I'll earn at least 102k$ / year
14:19:37 <ZK> yea, thats the usa
14:19:41 <ZK> well, the bay area anyhow
14:20:05 <ZK> although i think bay area is like 5000/month, and you earn 150k
14:20:41 <Yolteotl> yes, it is a bit less expensive there
14:20:50 <Yolteotl> 1mile away from Blizzard HQ
14:20:50 <Yolteotl> :P
14:21:35 <ZK> oh, and also only 33% income tax
14:21:46 <ZK> really low :P
14:23:58 <Yolteotl> compared to France
14:24:04 <Yolteotl> that's almost the same
14:39:16 <ZK> wait, france has low income taxes?
14:39:33 <ZK> and on top of that you have like all those social advantages?
14:39:47 <ZK> that... doesn't seem doable?
14:40:00 <ZK> no matter your income, your max tax on income is 33%?

15:26:36 <Zounds> We should play something today pons
15:26:52 <Zounds> maybe some OW or something once dub is around
15:28:09 <skrm> I dont really have time for video games until monday :(
15:32:50 <Zounds> Ah shame
15:37:44 <Yolteotl> just calculate, I earn 3387€ / month, and 2230 after taxes
15:38:01 <Yolteotl> so it looks like a 34% tax rate :)
15:38:20 <Yolteotl> ZK
15:38:50 <ZK> yea, but thats on a lower bracket
15:39:18 <ZK> if you got 7k euros per month, i bet your income tax would go up right?
15:39:48 <Yolteotl> yes, but I'm already paying more than the normal ppl
15:40:03 <ZK> normal being people making 2k per month?
15:40:32 <ZK> the more money you get, the higher percentage of taxes you pay, at least thats how it is in most places
15:40:32 <Yolteotl> EUR 9,710 – EUR 26,818: 14 percent EUR 26,819 – EUR 71,898: 30 percent EUR 71,899 – EUR 152,260: 41 percent EUR 152,261+: 45 percent
15:40:41 <Yolteotl> yes :)
15:40:45 <ZK> ok, yea that makes sense
15:41:05 <ZK> in california, at that 72000 to 152000, it's still 33% :P
15:41:11 <Yolteotl> hehhe
15:41:18 <ZK> the murican way
15:41:27 <Yolteotl> yes
15:41:45 <Yolteotl> I should still have a ~40k left / year to have fun . 
15:41:46 <ZK> but yea, i just started here, and only getting 3560 per month, but i like it here at least
15:41:56 <ZK> migt go to california one day i guess, just to get a bit of money
15:42:09 <Yolteotl> for Europe, 3560 is great!
15:42:37 <ZK> oh for sure! especially for somone just out of school!
15:42:49 <ZK> But compared to what i would have gotten in america, so low gege

15:51:06 <Yolteotl> I know that in California, I'll live a bit better than now, but that won't be THAT different
15:51:27 <Yolteotl> even if I'm paid 42k€ here against 102k$ there
