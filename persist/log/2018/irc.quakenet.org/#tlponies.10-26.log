06:30:47 <DoT|Phone1> needs more coffee
06:30:51 <DoT|Phone1> And you?
06:30:53 <skram> it always does
06:31:01 <skram> i should go to bed soon
06:36:55 <DoT|Phone1> Gnight then Skram <3

07:11:55 <DoT|Phone1> your still here Skram
07:12:08 <DoT|Phone1> what you up to
07:12:14 <skram> just one more cat picture, dad
07:12:41 <skram> how's the smuggeling operation going by the way
07:12:50 <skram> no go?
07:13:07 <DoT|Phone1> going to work in it this weekend
07:15:15 <DoT|Phone1> otherwise I may have to visit
07:16:34 <skram> if its so illegal you'd be arrested in the airport probably
07:16:55 <skram> or sew it into your jacket so they dont figure it out
07:17:01 <DoT|Phone1> but according to the ban list it isn't
07:17:10 <skram> i knooooooooooooow
07:17:20 <skram> i dont understand it either
07:17:33 <DoT|Phone1> And I suspect the courier companies just assume if you say chocolate it has milk
07:17:52 <skram> though i think if you just box it up and declare it as a gift it should be no problem
07:18:27 <skram> and say the value is 30 pounds or whatever it was
07:19:09 <DoT|Phone1> Yea. I'll figure it out and get it sent
07:19:22 <DoT|Phone1> couriers are just being silly
07:20:03 <DoT|Phone1> one apparently said they could do it for ¬£50
07:20:04 <skram> by couriers do you mean like
07:20:05 <skram> UPS
07:20:44 <DoT|Phone1> I'm not sure which ones they tried. they use a few with the business.
07:21:01 <DoT|Phone1> I'll look into it this weekend
07:21:08 <skram> couriers are usually for business
07:21:27 <skram> and theres different rules for stuff if you're a business trying to export i think
07:21:40 <skram> anyway
07:22:08 <skram> if they say no just eat the dang package alright?
07:22:29 <DoT|Phone1> nah. I'll sort it

18:44:22 <DuB_phone> I got a primal ancient chantodo wand, which from seasons 4-10 would have been a pretty free ticket to top 1000 wiz
18:44:48 <DuB_phone> Archon is rip tho

18:45:36 <DuB_phone> I want to spam 90+ grifts so I can put big gems in things
18:47:05 <Camail> yea i could probably get my gems up to par and liquify them into armor and that would get me enough to do 99
18:47:16 <Camail> solo grifts seems extremely easy
18:47:22 <Camail> they just feel like dps checks and rng
18:47:31 <DuB_phone> Extra 2k mainstat is preeeetty good
