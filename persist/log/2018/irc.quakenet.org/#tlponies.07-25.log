01:47:35 <Camail> man, some of those rails were nutty
01:47:48 <Camail> aiming vertically is such a pain
01:58:18 <Camail> no mans sky actually has multiplayer now
02:00:45 <Camail> I'm tempted to play it again
02:01:16 <Camail> i actually enjoyed the original version, honestly. I wasn't aware of the insane hype until it launched so it didn't disappoint me as drastically
02:09:36 <DuB`> Hehe
02:09:43 <DuB`> Chill space and exploration sounds nice
02:12:28 <DuB`> 50% off now hmm
02:12:33 <Camail> i have the game already, if anyone wanted someone to play with
02:12:36 <Camail> not you tho
02:12:38 <Camail> never you
02:13:45 <DuB`> aw
02:14:22 <Camail> (is joke ur the best)
02:16:53 <Camail> i never beat the main story because BOY was it terribly made
02:17:09 <Camail> not like, a matter of taste. just really easy to be impossible to finish
02:26:11 <Camail> woooo you can still do the bug
02:26:42 <Camail> so if you melee right before you jetpack you get a ton of forward momentum, they were gonna fix that bug
02:26:50 <Camail> and now they added a custom animation for it

03:29:47 <Camail> wtf new steam ai
03:29:49 <Camail> ui*
03:30:09 <Camail> wtffff everything is flat colors
03:30:13 <Camail> god damnit apple
03:30:25 <Camail> i dont actually mind it, but it's the principle of it all
03:31:03 <DuB`> All reviews: Mostly Negative, Recent reviews: Very Positive
03:31:13 <DuB`> Heh
03:31:14 <Camail> there was so much hate
03:31:23 <DuB`> twas real
03:31:40 <Camail> i just fuckin died falling off a cliff
03:31:43 <DuB`> Similar to games you've played: Stellaris
03:31:47 <DuB`> uh no nope
03:31:47 <Camail> i'm used to having a better jet packkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
03:31:56 <Camail> oops, thats a thing my keyboard does sometimes
03:32:03 <DuB`> Haha
03:32:20 <DuB`> If NMS is like stellaris then minecraft is like civilization
03:32:28 <DuB`> Silly steam
03:32:37 <Camail> if the tages match, they are the same game
03:32:39 <Camail> facts
03:33:13 <Camail> tho honestly nms feels more fun on a harder difficulty
03:33:35 <Camail> my first playthrough was on normal (the only one available at the time)
03:33:57 <Camail> and you kinda just got resources and built stuff, very straightforward, very little scarcity
03:35:23 <Camail> i might use controller this time around
04:20:37 <Camail> my left erabud is dying so i change the balance to heavily favor that side
04:20:40 <Camail> it works...for now
