00:46:19 <Dot> gnight
00:47:42 <DuB`> Well at least Dragons won a game.
00:47:54 <DuB`> Could've easily gone game 5, illios was kinda throwy
00:54:13 <skram> if they ever win its gonna be the greatest victory of any team in OWL
01:00:18 <skram> on the subject of colors, i think the valiant have the nicest color palette DuB`
01:04:19 <Crisium> wrong
01:06:51 <DuB`> skram they are the LAvocados
01:07:06 <skram> i like it
01:07:52 <DuB`> "two pocketed Orisas slowly destroying and replacing barriers is truly the pinnacle of Overwatch esports"

19:27:46 <Camail> ez
19:28:04 <Zounds_> Sounds good!
19:28:06 <carcinisation> i had a first in comp the other day. our late arrival last picked ana as 3rd healer (with 1 dps) o.O
19:28:22 <Zounds_> If I had my way I could play Reaper or Soldier or McCree every time I dps
19:28:25 <DuB`> Genji is hard, tracer is just track well at the right distances
19:28:26 <Zounds_> but that just aint viable most of hte time
19:28:50 <Zounds_> Maybe I should just embrace my inner Monkey and Zen
19:29:23 <Zounds_> Yeah my Tracer is kinda serviceable most of the time
19:29:30 <Zounds_> Genji is harder to do much with
19:31:07 <DuB`> He can dump damage into tanks from range to farm blade while keeping an eye out for opportunities to finish off out of position/low squishies
19:31:40 <carcinisation> no interest in sombra zounds?
19:31:50 <DuB`> But his playstyle depends way more on the the comps of both teams and map than tracer's
19:32:59 <Zounds_> I think I could get the hang of him if I tried more than once a week
19:33:01 <Zounds_> laters dub
19:33:31 <DuB`off> Yeah I don't get nearly enough genji practice recently
19:33:37 <DuB`off> Time to go lern
19:34:34 <Zounds_> carcinisation: Sombra is cool but doesn't really appeal much to me

20:15:50 <skram> Dot old boy, how's your face?
20:18:07 <Dot> jonas pal, is ok
20:18:09 <Dot> you?
20:18:34 <skram> perfectly acceptable
20:24:48 <Dot> good
20:24:51 <Dot> what you up to?
20:25:38 <skram> nothing at all
20:26:06 <skram> i wanna play the game but i dont wanna do it alone
20:28:02 <Camail> I'd play but only softcore
20:28:10 <Camail> I'm not into that heavy pet play
20:29:28 <skram> will you wear the bit gag and the latex hooves at least
20:30:17 <Camail> i feel like the line in the sand is very clear, and any equipment you have to buy from a specialty store is on the other side
20:31:18 <skram> i guess i underestimated you
20:31:24 <skram> overestimated
20:31:28 <skram> regardless
20:31:33 <skram> my estimation was wrong
20:31:56 <Camail> misestimated
20:32:01 <Camail> that should be a word
20:32:12 <Camail> where the point isnt that you thought more of or less of a person
20:32:21 <Camail> but merely that you didnt do it right
20:32:39 <Camail> gets rid of potentially shitty connotations 
20:32:40 <skram> exactly
20:32:47 <Camail> that's it, its a word now, I've made it a word
20:32:56 <skram> thats how language works
20:33:00 <Camail> eyup

20:33:45 <skram> sure
