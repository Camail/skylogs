03:44:30 <BioPon> Team did A win
03:57:12 <Camail> BioPon  i found a real dumb build, I am getting roughly 100+ block each fight
03:57:58 <Camail> it's a wordy explanation so once I get fucked or win I'll lay it out
04:04:08 <Camail> this is how you fucking get to lvl 3 warlock
04:04:12 <Camail> mercer you god dm
04:09:11 <BioPon> Seems good
04:09:32 <BioPon> Imma have yo catch the vod of critrole tonight
05:14:40 <Micen|Droid> Bio be prepared to laugh. The jokes are pretty good tonighg
05:23:32 <Camail> turns out that when you draw 10-14 cards a turn and have cards that say "every card in your hand costs 0" you win
05:24:13 <Camail> i finished the stage 3 boss with 250 block and like -4 hp
