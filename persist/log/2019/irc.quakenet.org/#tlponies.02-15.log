04:07:06 <Camail> i had a rando in apex who kept getting mad at us for kill stealing
04:07:23 <Camail> it amazing how easy it is to tell if someone is still in highschool
04:07:49 <DuB`> lulul
04:08:06 <Camail> today i had like 3 games in a row with douchebags so i just called it quits
04:08:11 <Camail> and that was just playing with skram
04:20:40 <DuB`> My brother got a bug in Apex where it has unbound literally every key and maxed his video settings

08:34:43 <skram> we'll see
08:45:47 <DoT|Phone1> gl
08:46:06 <DoT|Phone1> you have any plans for vampire slaying?
08:46:16 <DoT|Phone1> because mine is to run away
08:46:59 <skram> all my plans involve sword + face
08:47:58 <DoT|Phone1> I think if we can free up the ogres by killing the weak cultists we may be in a better position
09:01:44 <DoT|Phone1> I don't want bengalberk to die Skram
09:01:53 <skram> ride or die, dot
09:02:28 <DoT|Phone1> you'll break poor little Otis's heart
09:42:02 <Micen> We got this. 
09:49:09 <DoT|Phone1> How long can a demon keep 3 vampires busy?
09:49:41 <skram> depends how pretty the demon is
10:04:48 <DoT|Phone1> so the plan is kendalbort and the demon die fighting the vampires while the rest of us run away

18:47:03 <skram> why
18:53:54 <Zounds> so violent skram
18:53:57 <skram> are you also listening to the wii fit soundtrack?
18:54:08 <skram> video games made me this way zounds
18:54:18 <Zounds> I had to restrain a guy yesterday
18:54:35 <skram> what'd he do
18:55:01 <Zounds> Cheeky cunt thought he'd toss his drinks over the away support on his way past
18:55:12 <Zounds> grabbed his ass and he ended up being banned from the stadium
18:55:40 <skram> what a goober
18:55:43 <Zounds> well I grabbed his arms not his ass but you get the idea
18:55:48 <Zounds> yeh little prick
18:57:27 <skram> what sort of stadium was it
18:57:54 <Zounds> football stadium, celtic park so pretty big
18:58:12 <skram> fuckin hooligans
18:58:41 <skram> how do you keep banned people out though in a stadium that seats thousands
18:59:03 <skram> i imagine theres a lot of shits that have been banned from celtic park
19:01:10 <Zounds> It is pretty much impossible to 100% enforce the ban in a stadium that size
19:01:26 <Zounds> but you do make it difficult for them to buy tickets and supporters groups can't interact with them
19:01:31 <Zounds> or they'll get banned too
19:01:43 <Zounds> also they lose any season ticket they might have had
19:02:00 <skram> good
19:05:31 <skram> do people still fight at football matches zounds
19:05:43 <skram> like the whole old firm thing in the 80s
19:09:09 <Zounds> Old firm is just the name of the derby match Celtic vs Rangers
19:09:27 <Zounds> Security and police are way more on top of it than they used to be but people still try to fight yeah
19:09:37 <Zounds> usually save it for the streets of glasgow afterwards now tho :P
19:10:40 <Zounds> Proper nutcases at those matches sometimes though, my buddy got his hand sliced by a knife because he wouldn't take a bribe to let somebody through an exit gate a few months back
19:11:04 <skram> glasgow sounds like a scary place
19:11:40 <Zounds> It's not really you can live here and be fine almost always
19:12:04 <Zounds> The shitfest surrounding football gets a bit out of hand but you kinda have to involve yourself in it for it to be a problem
19:13:14 <skram> I used to run with the support club for the local hockey team which has a rivalry with Oslo and we sometimes exchanged harsh words
19:13:20 <skram> its idiotic regardless
19:13:42 <Zounds> Yeah it's beyond a joke sometimes
19:14:03 <Zounds> I was up in shitty little Ross County on tuesday and the Inverness away support broke 20 seats in a 2-2 cup match game
19:14:25 <Zounds> Like, I wish I was 10% as passionate about literally anything in life as these twats are about their shitty teams drawing a game of football :s
19:14:37 <skram> hahah
19:15:18 <skram> yeh i dont think there were ever any sort of hooliganism like that in our matches but people got waaay into it
19:16:03 <skram> like, death threats to 'enemy' players level of into it
19:17:47 <Zounds> Aye
19:18:07 <Zounds> It's one thing I'll say for Rugby, the fans are so much more reasonable
19:18:33 <Zounds> Both teams sit amongst each other and they are allowed alcohol and still cause very few problems
19:19:17 <skram> its probably a bit harder to develop that whole us vs. them mentality if you have to sit next to them
19:20:16 <Zounds> On average they are much wealthier and better educated than football supporters which contributes to it aswell
19:20:37 <Zounds> Dunno what hockey demographics are like but football is the working class mans game mostly
19:21:30 <skram> thats what hockey is too
19:22:02 <carcinization> "rugby is a thug's game played by gentlemen and football is a gentleman's game played by thugs"
19:22:04 <skram> for peasants i mean
19:22:46 <skram> and all the teams are heavily tied to cities so you got that whole thing going
19:23:03 <skram> like fuck those oslo boys, and to hell with those oil sheik cunts down in stavanger and so on
19:27:05 <Golly> i mean, the Stavanger team is called Oilers...
19:27:25 <skram> yeh
19:27:55 <skram> They have more monies than all the other teams
19:30:57 <Golly> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULeDlxa3gyc
19:32:05 <skram> this is the most 80s thing
19:33:11 <Golly> i think the origin of this is football fans of a rich area harrassing fans from a poor area by waving money at them
19:34:59 <skram> thats kind of hilarious
19:35:13 <skram> is that what you do at hockey matches golly
19:35:22 <skram> with your stinkin' oil skrilla

20:21:49 <Phearlock> Changeling space program fanfic is adorbs on the other hand, very cute.
20:22:52 <Phearlock> The Final solution is the second fic in a currently 2 fic series depicting what I assume is an equestira origins story
20:23:11 <Phearlock> Where all the ponies are alicorns and basically a servitor species
20:24:00 <Phearlock> And how a couple of young alicorns whom might be quite familiar get started on changing that.
20:24:10 <Camail> DuB`  why does this game hate me
20:24:14 <Zounds> I like it when Applejack help Rarity or the cutie mark crusaders are getting up to mischief
20:24:15 <Camail> we had such a good run
20:24:25 <Zounds> Fanfic world goes way too weird sometimes
20:24:30 <DuB`> Wha Cam
20:24:34 <Phearlock> It's neat. Magic, Lasers, aircarriers, nukes, the moon is a giant magnetic accelerator cannon.
20:24:38 <Camail> apex hates me
20:24:40 <DuB`> What'd you doooo
20:24:45 <Camail> it keeps crashing!

20:26:34 <Camail> troy makes it out just fine
20:26:45 <carcinization> yes. do note i am reading the modern prose translation by john dolan (the war nerd)

20:32:02 <carcinization> i am out of fancy cheese, i need to go buy more
20:41:24 <Dot> cam, last few circles might be a good idea to call bios ult then run away and see of anyone bites
20:41:35 <Camail> ehh
20:42:01 <Dot> if you have it, its a bit dangerous to use late game
20:50:24 <Phearlock> Oh neat they're making a sequel to the MLP movie.
20:50:38 <Phearlock> Hope that means more cute edgehorse
20:50:56 <Dot> i will be very displeased if we dont get more edge horse
