00:31:54 <skram> (((doubt)))
00:32:22 <Bio> i've tried literally every fucking "fix" for apex
00:32:28 <Bio> ITS STILL SHIT
00:32:46 <Bio> fuck your game EA
00:32:52 <Runbunny> In what way is it being shit?
00:33:01 <Runbunny> Tell me of your troubles.
00:33:06 <skram> like all the ways runbun
00:33:26 <Runbunny> Are you being intentionally vague?
00:34:49 <Bio> about 3 mins after I load into the game
00:34:57 <Bio> it says I can't communicate with the server
00:35:07 <Bio> and says fuck you go to EA's shit website
00:35:30 <Bio> doesn't matter if I'm in game, or in training, or in the lobby looking at skins
00:36:52 <Runbunny> That sounds weird as shit.
00:37:11 <Bio> I think rumor has it that its an Nvidia GPU Issue
00:37:20 <Bio> skrm do you have a not nvidia
00:37:54 <Runbunny> You'd think that the GPU isn't resposible for communicating with the server though.
00:38:05 <skram> I do have an nvidia
00:38:10 <Bio> indie dev company i guess

03:00:51 <Camail> also its your fault TL lost
03:00:59 <Camail> you didn't give them enough energy
03:03:54 <DuB`> I'm a week behind, just been VODing
03:04:06 <DuB`> ALso yes, I couldn't even watch TL D:
03:07:01 <Camail> DUB they have a twitch extension now
03:07:05 <Camail> its really cool!
03:07:18 <Camail> more reason to watch live!
03:11:05 <Camail> wow, normal latency on twitch is down to 6 seconds
03:12:08 <Camail> they've really done well with their growth, now that they dont rely on league tournaments they can cater to normal streaming
03:17:06 <DuB`> Who has a twitch extension
03:17:07 <DuB`> For wat
03:20:31 <Camail> CR
03:20:44 <Camail> because they cut ties with GS they no longer have to do alpha stuff
03:20:53 <Camail> so they set up the bells and whistles for the main stream
03:21:14 <Camail> dnd beyond has a twitch extension
03:21:26 <Camail> you can see every characters char sheet, current hp, lots of stuff
03:21:54 <DuB`> Ah, very nice

04:50:55 <Camail> maybe switching to their own channel actually did something
04:51:04 <Camail> lots of people didnt want to follow gns because of the other shows
04:51:36 <Camail> last time i paid attention it was in the 40k range
04:53:06 <Camail> my colonists' dog son just tanked some megaspiders

16:16:02 <BioPhone> I will name him Tim and he shall be my frinds
16:17:48 <Zounds> pets are fun till you have to go somewhere
16:17:59 <Zounds> then you must find somewhere for them to stay meanwhile D:
16:18:43 <Zounds> I've been battling with myself wether to get a creature of my own recently but I think it's too much hassle in my case
16:22:21 <skram> what about a camel
16:22:29 <skram> they can do like 60 days without water or whatever
16:22:32 <BioPhone> My ferret has been a good boy. Left him for a week and hes still good. Wouldn't want much longer than that tho
16:23:21 <skram> how old is your ferret bio
16:23:43 <BioPhone> 5 ish
16:25:53 <Runbunny> Bio consider getting a pet for your ferret.
16:26:03 <Runbunny> I suggest getting a skram.

16:34:17 <Dot> do i have pizza now and get hungry again later or wait till actual food time
16:34:38 <skram> have pizza now
16:34:40 <skram> and later
16:34:51 <Dot> i only have 1
16:34:59 <skram> MAKE ANOTHER
16:35:04 <Dot> i dont have the stuff
16:35:17 <skram> its pizza etiquette 101, dot
16:35:37 <skram> always make 25% more pizza then required for post-pizza pizza
16:35:38 <Dot> but poor etiquette 101 overides it

18:18:21 <Runbunny> How is he not dead?
18:18:38 <Camail> reading the comments, that's just how these cats are
18:18:40 <Camail> all the time
18:21:02 <Runbunny> So it's not actually mad. It just appear so?
18:22:23 <Camail> guess so
18:22:35 <Camail> if it was mad it would be swatting and biting him
18:22:43 <Camail> or running away
18:23:20 <Camail> animals universally leave annoying situations that they dont like
18:23:36 <Camail> that's hot smaller birds can even have a territory
18:23:39 <Camail> how*

21:04:55 <Zounds> It has the boss music playing when I ride it
21:05:15 <Zounds> I don't normally enable mount music but it's pretty epic for running between gathering nodes or something
21:05:35 <skrm> mount music?
21:05:57 <skrm> is there one that plays eye of the tiger
21:06:27 <Zounds> There's a tiger that might but I'm never gonna be arsed to get that one
21:06:42 <skrm> are you a casual
21:07:05 <Zounds> I suppose
21:07:18 <Zounds> It's one of these do an easy thing 384738478374837482734873 times kind of rewards

21:09:30 <Zounds> Yeah, not even daily in this case though so if you really want it there's no respite
21:09:47 <Zounds> It's based on Hunts which are sort of mini bosses that appear within the world
21:09:56 <Zounds> A ranks spawning randomly and S ranks that need some effort to spawn
21:10:14 <Zounds> So you gotta dedicate a lot of time to spawning and killing these things which can be quite tough
21:10:21 <Zounds> A lot of people do it and have fun with it but it's not for me
21:17:25 <BioPhone> Time to do the leave
