00:12:57 <Bio> internet
00:13:06 <Bio> i got a computer chair
00:13:09 <Bio> finally
00:13:12 <Bio> well, a new one
00:13:24 <Bio> much better than the lawn chair I was using
00:15:28 <Camail> much
01:33:46 <reification> night all
01:34:14 <Bio> nn
01:46:35 <Bio> time to go play more octopath
02:09:28 <Runbunny> Camail, Apparently kulve Torath is up the next 7 days.
02:24:07 <Camail> oh, cool
02:24:42 <Camail> i'm farming hornboy for 2 more horns to get the glaive
02:26:37 <Camail> oh damn, do the weapons really have purple sharpness?
02:31:34 <DuB`> How sharp is the color purple?
02:36:29 <Runbunny> I have never seen purple sharpness.
02:37:26 <Runbunny> there is no purple sharpness in mhw at least.
02:43:10 <Camail> ok the wiki must just be wrong
02:44:46 <Runbunny> From what I can gather, it just something that hasn't been added to the game yet.
02:52:13 <Runbunny> Essentially it was just something that was datamined.
02:58:04 <Camail> also previous games had purple
03:03:28 <Camail> i wonder when people are gonna get pissed off at fextralife essentially using bots because they embed their stream on autoplay on every wiki page
03:03:34 <Camail> because that's some bullshit

21:05:12 <Camail> it's just a grindy nostalgia trip
21:09:39 <Zounds> might not be bad to forget some things we learned cam
21:09:48 <Camail> nah

21:10:07 <Zounds> For reasons that extend beyond nostalgia that is
21:10:11 <Camail> i dont feel like having that conversation
21:11:52 <Zounds> Still not sure I'll play classic when it comes though, as much as I love the game I think I have probably seen enough
21:18:32 <Zounds> If they ever end up going the OSRS route of adding additional content while trying to maintain the same style I'd give it a try for sure

22:49:11 <Camail> Runbunny  i was just on a behmoth run that went TOO well
22:49:41 <Camail> we spent like 2 minutes on phase 3 and he did the meteor...
22:49:52 <Camail> went from 0 carts to 4, real quick
22:49:55 <Zounds> I have him as a mount in ffxiv
22:49:57 <Zounds> he's too big
22:50:26 <Camail> i only did that quest like 2 times
22:50:53 <Camail> story dungeons in ff14 are miserable
22:51:02 <Camail> its just a bunch of people on the roulette grind
22:51:12 <Camail> while you're just trying to play the game and watch cutscenes
22:51:42 <Runbunny> There were no comets?
22:51:58 <Runbunny> I did Kulve taroth. I didn't even get a gunlance :/
22:52:14 <Runbunny> Not even a rarity 8 weapon.
22:53:02 <Zounds> Camail: they do start putting all the relevant story stuff after you exit the dungeons now
22:53:10 <Zounds> and obviously the lead up to the dungeon before you queue
22:53:25 <Camail> Runbunny  there were, but they all came so fast
22:53:35 <Zounds> I never felt pressured lvling up in ffxiv at least
22:53:38 <Camail> we weren't prepared, didnt count the comets
22:53:50 <Zounds> after a certain point I mean
22:54:05 <Camail> Runbunny  at the beginning of phase 3 the first two attacks were comets
22:54:11 <Camail> before the other 2 guys even got there
22:54:43 <Camail> leveling was smooth in ff14, it was more of a community dynamic that caused the problem
22:55:04 <Camail> especially when you get to the msq dungeons that ppl farm
22:55:25 <Zounds> oh those 2
22:55:26 <Zounds> yeah fuck that
