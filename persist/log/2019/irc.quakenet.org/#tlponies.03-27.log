13:48:22 <Cane> Hello. I am Cane, and I am an idiot.
13:48:34 <Cane> I'm currently modding Skyrim again, knowing full well I'll mod it for a day and a half and then play it for an hour or two.
13:49:03 <DoT|Phone> mod it into stalker pls
13:51:38 <BioPhone> STOP
13:51:48 <BioPhone> YOU'VE VIOLATED THE LAW
13:51:48 <Cane> See, that was my first choice, but then I realized CoC and the various addons still haven't gotten any updates so I'd just be playing v1.5 again.
13:52:06 <Cane> See, I'm old school, I just picture the Daggerfall "HALT!" sound effect over and over and over and over
13:52:18 <DoT|Phone> no no cane
13:52:33 <DoT|Phone> mod skyrim INTO stalker
13:53:22 <DoT|Phone> add some anomalies, some guns, some guitars, some mutants
13:53:23 <DoT|Phone> easy
13:57:18 <DoT|Phone> I just need more stalker cane. please enable me
13:57:32 <Cane> 2021, unless GSC are liars.
13:57:54 <DoT|Phone> too far

16:03:45 <BioPhone> Pls
16:05:16 <reification> i bak
16:05:47 <Camail> skram  i looked at your build guide and the armor was so high level, and the mod to give body armor energy shield is also very very lategame
16:06:13 <Camail> all you need to care about, i think, is health, ES, and resists first
16:06:58 <Camail> damage typically comes from passive skills and support gems
16:07:47 <Camail> also i'd guess attack speed% is important for laying down poison stacks as fast as possible

16:53:10 <Camail> ah, you can use the jade amulet base to get a lot of dex
16:53:47 <Camail> and then just add dex to items as you need it
16:54:36 <Camail> picking up the dex passives in your tree might be a higher priority as well
16:54:47 <Camail> not the +10, but the +30s
16:54:55 <skram> maybe
16:54:57 <Camail> my witch has both +30s
16:55:08 <skram> i'd like to get all the life/ES stuff asap because im squishy as fuk
16:56:09 <Camail> yea, getting hp/es/res is pretty important
16:59:05 <skram> i did that one angle or devil boss guy in act 5 and died TOO FUCKING MUCH
16:59:12 <skram> like 9 teams
16:59:13 <skram> times
17:09:05 <Camail> were you dodging his big laser
17:09:13 <skram> mostly
17:09:36 <skram> single target is pretty bad with this build because it makes it hard to build stacks
17:09:44 <skram> and when i have to move the stacks drop quickly
17:10:32 <Camail> yea you have to have a build designed for single target to really have a good one
17:10:44 <Camail> there's no real balance, most builds focus on map clearing
17:11:17 <Camail> is the rain of arrows thingy a channeling spell
17:11:27 <Camail> or do you shoot it out and it rains arrows for a few seconds
17:12:13 <skram> no its x projectiles per 1 cast
17:12:33 <skram> so i have to spam it
17:13:17 <skram> its just like a regular bow attack except its 9 arrows that lands in an AoE
17:13:25 <skram> i just need to be better at stutterstepping and stuff
17:14:03 <skram> because it has an animation that i dont think i can cancel which prevents me from flame dashing and thats often enough for me to die
17:22:38 <skram> anyway gotta go for a bit, plej later y/n?
17:23:07 <Camail> y
17:23:13 <Camail> once dot gets back
17:23:17 <Camail> oh wait he's here

22:03:30 <Dot> Dub is the only one to have put his backstory into his character sheet
22:03:32 <Dot> what a nerd
22:05:24 <DuB`> I mean it's the funnest part of dnd :P
22:05:27 <DuB`> STORII
22:08:15 <Dot> though i never understand the "doesnt understand ownership" in any race. surely if they take something they like the look of, then someone takes it from them they get annoyed?
22:08:32 <Dot> it was a thing they liked
22:08:32 <DuB`> I grew up in poor birb camp
22:08:40 <DuB`> We only had sticks and rocks anyway!
22:08:58 <Dot> the bird thing just reminded me, i see it with a few diffrent races
22:09:06 <Dot> tabaxi as well
22:10:33 <DuB`> I just pasted a bunch of stuff into some of those boxes for my future reference, put what mattered for my character in the actual bio part for now
22:10:40 <DuB`> As I'm sure you could tell
22:11:13 <Dot> yea, i can tell it wasnt your writing, it sounds very official DnD kind of writing
22:11:33 <Dot> thats why i commented in it, its sometihng i see with a few of thier races
22:13:54 <Rawr|Fone> Maybe dub doesn't understand ownership dot
22:14:21 <Dot> rawr, is someone went and took his PC and all his scarves i think he would then
22:16:20 <Rawr|Fone> That is your opinion
22:16:45 <DuB`> Dot has good opinions.
22:17:51 <Rawr|Fone> I think his opinions about coffee and cheese could be a little better

22:31:23 <Camail> it only ever shows items for people who are online, but even then some people are just bad
22:31:46 <Camail> they are much more attentive to 25c, but 1 alch or 1 fuse? nah
