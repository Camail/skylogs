00:00:08 <Camail> this will become interesting
00:00:16 <Camail> hopefully
00:00:54 <Camail> ugh, i still havent beaten the heart with silent...
00:01:03 <Camail> bleeeeeeh i dont want toooo
00:01:03 <carcinization> hmm should be good
00:01:38 <carcinization> well cam it's a game so you don't have to
00:02:39 <Camail> gotta eventually
00:09:32 <BioPhone> I did with poison and shields
00:09:38 <BioPhone> Takes a while tho
00:10:34 <Phearlock> I feel silent is probably most consistent at killing the heart
00:10:51 <Phearlock> of the three

00:19:46 <Camail> defect has the strongest cards in the game, though
00:20:09 <Camail> and ironclad has more permanent -str to deal with heart scaling
00:23:10 <Camail> hot damn there's some good art for one of these characters
00:23:26 <skram> i made it home Phearlock
00:24:12 <Phearlock> yay skram
00:24:22 <Phearlock> I love the beta art
00:25:08 <Runbunny> Any snow yet Jonas?
00:25:31 <Camail> the beta art is pretty memey
00:25:39 <skram> a whole bunch Runbunny
00:25:45 <skram> at LEAST 15 snow
00:25:57 <Camail> https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1614104912
00:26:23 <Runbunny> That is many.
00:26:57 <Phearlock> I need to play more to get all the ascensions, have 4 heart kills but only at like ascension 3-5
00:27:29 <Phearlock> finally managed to get a defect one after getting ironclad and silent twice.

00:32:27 <Camail> if you get a good powers deck and dont face bird boy, you could easily to asc 20

11:31:40 <skram> fantastic.
11:31:46 <Rawr|Fone> <3
11:32:22 <DoT|Phone> hey Phear, Skram <3
11:32:49 <skram> and also my favorite type of bj√∏rn

11:54:05 <skram> well im doing a work soon
11:54:36 <DoT|Phone1> go set all the things on fire
11:55:33 <skram> maybe i will!
12:01:50 <DoT|Phone1> Skram. we need Dragon fighting plans
12:02:09 <DoT|Phone1> it's too big for a net and has a lot of room to fly
12:12:27 <skram> hm
12:12:33 <skram> can we make a REALLY big net?
12:20:42 <DoT|Phone1> not in the time we have
12:21:27 <skram> hm
12:21:39 <skram> we're gonna throw dub on it and he can stab its eyes
12:23:06 <DoT|Phone1> we need to actually take stock of what we have and come up with some plans
12:23:46 <skram> we dont have much
12:23:50 <skram> except bling
12:24:20 <DoT|Phone1> it's true. we have 2 magic items. 1 proper spell caster
12:24:36 <DoT|Phone1> and the 2 items don't do anything flashy
12:24:38 <skram> got like 18 javelins though
12:25:23 <DoT|Phone1> you know... for level 7 we really really don't have much magic items
12:26:02 <DoT|Phone1> guidelines say everyone should have at least 1 by level 4 if I recall correctly
12:26:39 <skram> all barbarians should have +3 GREATSWORDS by level 7
12:26:41 <skram> BioPone pls
12:26:57 <DoT|Phone1> thems the rules
12:27:08 <skram> confirmed
12:28:46 <BioPone> What can I say. I love to break rules

12:35:33 <DoT|Phone> interesting point, 8 ogres is a deadly encounter for 5 lvl 7's
12:35:45 <DoT|Phone> there was 12 in 1 room apparently
12:36:00 <skram> yeah so we avoid that room
12:36:49 <DoT|Phone> this module is really badly designed lol
12:36:56 <skram> rude
12:37:17 <skram> wait are you reading the book
12:37:19 <skram> thats cheating, dot
12:37:23 <DoT|Phone> no
12:37:27 <DoT|Phone> we used the eye
12:37:40 <DoT|Phone> I recall what was said
12:38:16 <DoT|Phone> for a room to be what amounts to a double deadly encounter is insane
12:38:33 <DoT|Phone> no warnings, just a random door like any other
12:38:52 <skram> maybe there's a TWIST
12:38:58 <DoT|Phone> I'm honestly a bit offended you think I would read the book Skram
12:39:13 <skram> i was doing a joke
12:40:47 <DoT|Phone> hmm
12:41:19 <skram> anyway
12:41:24 <skram> gonna go to work
12:41:26 <BioPone> It is evening, and it's the barracks my dude
12:41:40 <skram> burn the place down
12:41:54 <BioPone> Perhaps booting down the door in the enemy palace isn't a great idea
12:42:52 <DoT|Phone> all it takes is a bad stealth roll while trying to look inside
12:45:08 <DoT|Phone> and it's not a knock against you bio. your doing an amazing job and I'm having fun, some things on this module just give me such pause
12:48:21 <BioPone> That's fair. But I suppose with the scouting you all have lots of info.
12:48:57 <BioPone> And yall have a way to enter the castle without needing to stealth
12:48:59 <DoT|Phone> Yea. trying really hard to make use of it and come up with plans
12:49:25 <BioPone> After that? We shall see
12:50:18 <DoT|Phone> we where given initiate level entrance. I don't recall there being mention of patrols/gaurd points
12:50:31 <DoT|Phone> to block access to areas
12:50:40 <DoT|Phone> but will find out
