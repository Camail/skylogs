00:03:35 <Camail> Runbunny so far, changing poe to single threading has made the game run smoother
00:04:02 <Runbunny> I remember hearing something about that years ago.
00:04:05 <Camail> maybe they just suck dick at certain architectures? i'm using intel so i just cant imagine that being true
00:04:32 <Runbunny> They spent all the time and money on the xbox version.
00:04:56 <Runbunny> Also the horrible chineese trailer :P

21:46:00 <Zounds> nvm
21:49:26 <Bio> rip
21:49:30 <Bio> I may give it a shot
21:49:39 <Bio> i was super young when vanilla came out
22:14:13 <Zounds> Yeah I'm gonna give it a shot aswell
22:14:37 <Zounds> I remember classic WoW fondly and I do have more recent experience through private server and it still held up pretty well
22:14:55 <carcinization> bio https://twitter.com/art_miguelito/status/1107313740033212417
22:14:58 <Zounds> but part of me thinks maybe I've seen enough but I guess I'll find out
22:20:20 <DuBtop> I'm just over here playing OSRS with some cousins like a giganerd
22:24:33 <Bio> I only remember pom pyro
22:24:38 <Bio> barely
22:24:49 <Bio> didn't do much of any raiding
22:24:56 <Bio> I think I did molten core a few times
22:25:01 <Bio> but not super competitively
22:26:45 <Camail> Runbunny  switching to my ssd has made sucha  huge difference
22:26:50 <Camail> which is kinda sad
22:26:57 <Camail> because having so much I/O is just... bad
22:27:11 <Runbunny> Yeah.
22:27:19 <Runbunny> I think I pointed it out to you.
22:30:56 <Camail> i knew it was an option from the start
22:31:01 <Camail> i just didnt want to use ssd space
22:31:26 <Camail> i don't like putting stuff on it, but this was such an extreme case
22:31:38 <Camail> but such a stark difference, gong from minutes to seconds
22:31:54 <Camail> just shows that they rely WAAAAY too much in secondary storage

22:37:04 <skrm> Weh.
22:38:26 <Zounds> you'd find vanilla raids really easy bio
22:38:28 <Camail> i do use it, i have my os on it
22:38:59 <Camail> but its very easy to fill 250gb nowadays if you aren't careful
22:39:21 <Zounds> preparation and getting the proper gear and mobilising 40 guys was the harder part
22:39:35 <Zounds> mechanics wise most fights are a lot easier than modern wow
22:40:44 <Zounds> coming to a vanilla raid with todays meta knowledge means they get rolled and smoked
22:47:28 <Bio> I bet
22:51:08 <skrm> true zounds, getting ~60 guys to farm nature res gear for princess huhuran was a logistic nightmare
22:52:34 <Camail> oh also runbun i dont think i should be using vaal arc cuz its my main dps, right? and if it takes souls to charge it up then it might not be good
22:52:50 <Camail> i'm leveling it up just in case
23:03:30 <Runbunny> Use it.
23:03:48 <Runbunny> Vaal gems gives both the regular skill and the Vaal skill.
23:12:36 <Camail> oh, cool
23:12:42 <Camail> also, fucking RIP tolman
23:12:46 <Camail> he did not have a good life
23:12:50 <Camail> at any point
23:13:30 <Camail> i still gotta level it, its only 6 and i'm at 15 right now
