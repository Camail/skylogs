00:00:49 <carcinization> night all
00:00:52 <Camail> Runbunny  yup it's part of the monhun genre
00:00:57 <Camail> some of this stuff is funky tho

00:06:50 <Runbunny> I see.
00:06:52 <Runbunny> Odd.
00:09:03 <Camail> but like, down to the missions having like a 40 minutes timer, missions dropping monster parts
00:09:20 <Camail> its really just anime monhun with a few more mechanics on top
00:09:51 <Camail> i think god eater has been the franchise that's been pushing the innovation on the genre, but i miiight be misremembering

00:51:18 <Camail> the anime tiddies are a bit much
00:56:57 <Camail> i wonder if the critical role animation will have a good VO cast
01:06:27 <BioPone> The what now
01:07:56 <BioPone> Neat
01:08:18 <BioPone> I c the yoke camil
01:13:02 <Camail> it's almost better if it sucks
01:13:16 <Camail> also, anime tiddy in god eater 3

09:02:46 <DoT|Phone> Runbun you see hob is still streaming? any idea how the run is going? or did it die
09:03:01 <DoT|Phone> it was going well at midnight
09:14:21 <Runbunny> Yeah
09:14:34 <Runbunny> It's a sub-a-thon.
09:14:49 <Runbunny> So there is still 9 hours left.
09:15:09 <Runbunny> I think he ripped lots of runs.
09:21:47 <Runbunny> .tell Camail I also got Nightmare King Grimm down in Hollow knight. Took a solid 1½ hours of tries.

17:02:35 <Camail> oh, nice
17:02:43 <Camail> that boss is crazy
17:02:49 <Camail> took me a long time as well
17:02:54 <Runbunny> Indeed.
17:03:07 <Runbunny> but afterwards I did some godhome stuff.
17:03:09 <Camail> its weird, the "good" ending for the dlc doesn't let you fight him
17:03:28 <Camail> so it's like...fuck that let the grimm troupe eat the suffering, idc i wanna fight
17:03:28 <Runbunny> where you fight the regular version and my timings were completely fucked.
17:03:43 <Camail> i havent done any godhome stuff
17:03:57 <Camail> but yea having muscle memory work against you is the worst
17:09:54 <Camail> supposedly there's another ending after doing the godhome stuff... but i dunno it's just so arcadey
17:10:03 <Camail> completely takes me out of the game
17:13:17 <Runbunny> Yeh.
17:13:42 <Runbunny> I don't think I have ever enjoyed a boss rush in any game.
17:14:20 <reimeuk> dot cr|42 https://twitter.com/Brainmage/status/1100064104713211908
17:14:31 <Camail> like, the path of pain made sense, and it was amazing
17:15:12 <Camail> but grinding bosses feels weird, it kinda devalues the fights, they were one time things
17:15:55 <Camail> you can always have more platforming, remixing old compositions for fresh content. Doesn't work for bosses, at least for me
17:18:42 <Dot> skram https://imgur.com/gallery/aDlOpHi
17:20:50 <Zounds> I always kinda wanted a boss rush challenge in dark souls
17:21:00 <Zounds> I thought it would be fun to see if I could beat all bosses with one set of recovery items
17:21:12 <Zounds> but there's no way they could put it in without it seeming out of place and dumb
17:23:05 <Zounds> Though the Undead Match they made for PvP duels in 3 is really out of place and still fun so maybe
17:26:45 <Runbunny> There are also harder versions of the bosses.
17:28:15 <Runbunny> but some of the fights, the harder version is just "boss deals 2x damage"
17:42:41 <Camail> yea they did path of pain for people who like hard platforming and boss rush for people who like hard combat
17:43:03 <Camail> but in the end i NEED story to motivate me, especially in the setting of my favorite game
17:43:23 <Camail> but the story is just "this is a challenge"

18:32:59 <Camail> a fromsoft streamer who is trying to no-hit all their games
18:33:03 <Runbunny> https://www.twitch.tv/the_happy_hob
18:33:44 <Zounds> 30+ hours?
18:34:05 <Zounds> Streamers pls
18:36:32 <Camail> yea it's dumb and unhealthy, but if you only do it like once a year, sure
18:40:33 <Zounds> Aye
18:44:27 <Zounds> Dark souls 2 is kinda ugly and there is some real dumb stuff in the game but I do love it so
18:45:41 <Zounds> I bought that game 3 times x_x
18:48:04 <Runbunny> O:
18:49:55 <Camail> the complete dark souls 2 package is pretty good now
18:50:07 <Zounds> Scholar of the first Sin is still fairly active when I played through a few months ago
18:50:25 <Zounds> Was even ab;e to get mirror knight summons within 5mins
18:50:37 <Zounds> Or looking glass knight I should say
18:51:08 <Zounds> The trick to get summoned by him is to repeatedly spam your red sign, doing it once and leaving it doesn't seem to work as well :P
18:56:49 <Camail> Runbunny you gonna try out god eater?
18:57:18 <Camail> the weapon i'm using atm is dualblades that have a stance change that turn them into a double bladed pole arm thing
18:57:52 <Camail> the mechanics in this game are a bit more complex than monhun, haven't quite figured everything out
18:58:53 <Camail> but you can tell the money evaporated when it came to designing areas, it must be the engine's biggest flaw
19:12:32 <Runbunny> I am not sure.
19:12:39 <Runbunny> Probably not atm.
