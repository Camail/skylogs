14:09:08 <DoT|Phone> what is a ped then?
14:09:11 <DoT|Phone> I'm confused
14:09:35 <BioPhone> Pedestal, the check you need the three pendants to get
14:09:49 <BioPhone> Where you would get the master sword in vanilla
14:10:23 <DoT|Phone> I.never played any Zelda games
14:10:43 <BioPhone> You should, they are great

20:51:19 <Camail> ur a goof
20:51:42 <Camail> damn, 49 minutes hunt runbun?
20:51:45 <BioPhone> Also yes
20:51:46 <Camail> thats old school
20:52:41 <Camail> its partly because you literally just started using it, partly because it's kinda a shit solo weapon
20:52:54 <Camail> you went a long time without carting, which is nice
20:55:30 <Runbunny> I did cart twice.
20:55:43 <Runbunny> The last 2 minutes were super intense.
20:56:20 <Runbunny> Plus it janked out and slept in the acid. So I had to brave the waters to bomb it.
21:00:19 <Camail> haha
21:00:30 <Camail> i thought it slept in the acid all the time
21:00:40 <Camail> every time i've fought it, that happens
21:00:54 <Camail> it runs home, you fight it for a second in the acid, it sleeps
21:01:45 <Camail> vaal is easy with miasma because it lets you freely hit the stomach so you dont get blighted
21:02:08 <Camail> and when you are in the stomach none of the really damaging attacks hit you
21:03:48 <Runbunny> Usually it sleeps on top of the pile of bones
21:10:35 <Camail> i know in normal vaal it does, i just assumed it was a change cuz all 3 of my last phase fights started there

22:35:31 <Camail> Runbunny  i carted twice early on kirin, got it to limp 20 minutes later, then carted almost immediately in the last area
22:35:42 <Camail> though i am really close to soloing it
22:35:45 <Runbunny> Rough.
22:36:00 <Camail> i wasnt using the counter enough, i was playing it like IG
22:36:17 <Camail> but the safest place to be is right up next to it with LS
22:36:21 <Runbunny> Do you use thunder res decos?
22:36:29 <Camail> nah, antipara and steadfast
22:36:35 <Camail> then i get eledef from meal
22:36:49 <Camail> i have full resist coverage for allt he ailments
22:37:00 <Camail> but it just does so much damage so quickly sometimes
22:37:03 <Camail> especially solo
22:37:06 <Runbunny> Also if you pick up the dragon pods it drops you can hit it when it enrages and not bounce.
22:37:32 <Camail> i dont bounce off it?
22:37:38 <Camail> white sharpness
22:37:51 <Runbunny> well long sword has anti bounce mechanics as well. 
22:38:02 <Runbunny> You can still end the enrage.
22:38:11 <Camail> yea that sounds very helpful
22:38:18 <Camail> the enrage zig zag killed me
22:38:43 <Camail> i was hitting it next to a wall, countered a lightning and followed through, it started zig zagging towards the wall and immediately doubled back and hit me in the face
22:39:00 <Camail> i didnt even see it happen
22:39:08 <Runbunny> That sounds very jank :D
22:39:27 <Camail> it was fucked
22:39:33 <Camail> gonna try a few more times
22:39:37 <Camail> wanna do dailies in an hour

22:40:21 <Runbunny> Might have gone to bed. I just wanted to do 2 event quests to get some layered armor.
22:41:01 <Camail> i use like 30+ pots each kirin attempt >_>
22:41:18 <Camail> good thing i have 1k honey
22:41:27 <Camail> thats cool, maybe later
22:41:35 <Camail> i got the butterfly armor
22:41:49 <Camail> might use it on my SA build, if i ever use that weapon again...
22:42:29 <Runbunny> I am using the layered armor from kirin. A beautiful dress.
23:00:31 <Dot> its cold

23:11:12 <Camail> Runbunny killed angry pikachu
23:11:27 <Camail> only 1 cart, but i dunno how many times i wanna do that...
23:11:36 <Camail> might get the layered armor, if its actually nice
23:12:08 <Camail> ummmm Runbunny  i didnt get a kirin ticket...
23:12:17 <Camail> i thought it was a 100% drop
23:12:34 <Camail> oh nvm, i did
23:13:19 <Runbunny> I got 2 tickets when I did it.
23:13:45 <Runbunny> but the game keeps dropping my connection. Maybe it's because I alt tab all the time?
23:14:05 <Camail> if you do borderless fullscreen i dont see why it would
23:14:16 <Camail> losing focus doesn't do much at that point
23:15:03 <Runbunny> Yeah, but I think it's slow downs and such, like having a stream running plus youtube plus monster hunter.
23:16:03 <Golly> ooh rael gonna play ace combat on stream soon
23:31:02 <Bio> ?biostream
23:31:05 <Bio> turbo with skrm
23:33:02 <Runbunny> I swear the input reading is real Camail. As soon as you press perform the monster will drop whatever it was doing and come jumping straight at you.
23:33:50 <Camail> i mean, monsters do have ai to react to things like healing and sharpening
23:33:56 <Camail> it might be you, tho
23:34:14 <Camail> so i just had rock mantle on and got a face full of OHKO from kirin
23:34:33 <Camail> i dont think i can use it in a group, i cant control the attack patterns as well
23:37:34 <Runbunny> Rock mantle is also really bad against a lot of hits, since you don't get invis frames wearing it.
23:38:05 <Runbunny> So Bertelguze + rock steady mantle is a really really bad time.
23:45:24 <Camail> yea i'm aware, i usually avoid those attacks, or dont even fight those monsters
