01:08:35 <Runbunny> Welcome to weebness and denegeracy Bio.
01:09:25 <skrm> game looks friggin gorgeous though
01:09:29 <Bio> right
01:09:36 <Bio> you watch this story
01:09:40 <Bio> and tell me i'm wrong
01:09:56 <Bio> oh, but man, no cutscenes
01:10:11 <Bio> T_T
01:10:23 <Runbunny> :/
01:10:31 <skrm> what games do you have on your switch bio
01:10:40 <Bio> this one, zleda, and smash
01:10:45 <skrm> i need you to convince me to get one so i can play zeldor
01:10:56 <Bio> literally those three are worth it
01:11:15 <Bio> then 2019 is gonna have a bunch of nintendo 1st party games
01:11:26 <Bio> P I K M I N 
01:11:48 <Bio> Fire emblem, metroid prime, pokemens, and others
01:12:05 <Bio> also a non-poke game from Game Freak, which is interesting
01:12:10 <skrm> what about new pokemans
01:12:29 <Bio> yeah, gen 9 is coming 2019 on switch
01:13:07 <skrm> i was thinking about the lest go pikachu thing
01:13:16 <Bio> I WONT HOLD BACK
01:13:32 <Bio> LETS GET DOWN TO BUISINESS
01:13:45 <Runbunny> I was thinking of getting into Smash, but the "membership" to play online is discouraging.
01:13:56 <Bio> yeah thats a bit annoying
01:14:15 <Bio> especially since its just smash and splatoon for online right now
01:14:45 <skrm> i dont care about smesh
01:15:08 <Bio> gawd
01:15:37 <Bio> 90% of her charm is in the cutscenes
01:17:18 <Bio> Oh No... T_T
01:18:22 <Bio> best nerd as well
01:18:43 <Bio> with the standard protagonist complete obliviousness to attraction
01:19:53 <Bio> Got more than you bargained for! :)
01:20:44 <Runbunny> I was courious about octopath traveller, but I don't own a switch :/
01:20:46 <Bio> Pay to win with best grill Tressa
01:21:10 <Bio> honestly bun its really fun if you like jrpgs
01:21:26 <Bio> it reminds me a lot of a really pretty FF like 3 or 6
01:23:24 <Runbunny> I loved the shit out of Chrono trigger.
01:23:38 <Runbunny> but the only platform I own is PC.
01:23:43 <Bio> what a luck
01:24:05 <Runbunny> Technically I also have a Wii but I don't use it at all.
01:24:20 <Runbunny> Might be in the attic.
01:24:20 <Bio> yeh
01:24:32 <Bio> i really like my switch, i don't regret it at all
01:26:36 <Bio> one of my favorite things about this game is the OST
01:26:42 <Bio> each char has their theme
01:26:45 <Bio> but then
01:27:04 <Bio> when you get to a char's chapter boss, it like morphs from their theme into the boss music
01:27:15 <Bio> and its an A E S T H E T I C i rly love

21:24:19 <Camail> also too many people dont know that tempered creatures can only be flashed 4 times
21:24:35 <Camail> but it's understandable because none of these fucks flash at the right times anyway
21:25:16 <Camail> i have a bunch of gleaming streamstones, it's not too difficult to farm the normal tempered dragons

21:28:52 <Dot> he did it!
21:29:30 <Camail> the augment material for insect glaive is called Hero's Streamstone: Shaft
21:29:37 <Camail> so i got to augment my shaft with healing
21:34:55 <Camail> Kulve is so relaxing
21:39:13 <Runbunny> Kulve is really easy actually.
