16:56:46 <reification> wiki says "Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed."

20:18:00 <Camail> skram if he lies about where he lives, what else could he be lying about
20:18:06 <Camail> surely we must doubt his humanity
20:18:37 <skram> that is a good point
20:20:34 <Bio> i want a farkin pizza
20:20:41 <Bio> luckily i have monies
20:20:45 <Bio> to convert to pizza
20:27:47 <skram> it is good of you to mention pizza because it made me remember the one i put in my oven 30 minutes ago
20:27:51 <skram> its only lightly singed

20:33:19 <Camail> and he fled
20:37:30 <Camail> hmm, the poe community has become so much bigger since i last tried, i might try it again someday
20:37:38 <Camail> it's certainly not off the table like it used to be
20:37:59 <Camail> it was basically impossible for me to find meaningful guides and fundamental info when i first tried it

21:19:49 <Camail> no
21:37:08 <Golly> ooh, more day9 subnautica
21:38:08 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/day9tv
21:38:18 <Camail> he's gonna meet big boy
21:38:21 <Camail> really soon
21:38:39 <Phearlock> Oh I should watch that
21:38:51 <Phearlock> Oh yeah he's there
21:38:52 <Phearlock> haha
21:39:11 <Camail> ahahahaha
21:41:16 <Phearlock> I even replayed this lately and I had issues finding the entrance again haha
21:41:28 <Phearlock> Silly ship
21:41:38 <Camail> i never went underwater here
21:41:43 <Camail> didnt even know it was this big
21:42:16 <Phearlock> I usually do use this entrance he used cause it's technically faster, just easy to get a bit disoriented in where the entrance is

21:46:36 <Camail> and his fear is making this go really slowly
21:46:52 <Phearlock> That's ok xD
21:48:41 <Camail> he can avoid this boy, but he cant avoid the ghost leviathan
21:48:51 <Camail> so we will EVENTUALLY get what we want
21:49:15 <Phearlock> I usually only see mr snek when I exit the ship myself
21:49:34 <Phearlock> He just never hangs around when I zoom in.
21:50:09 <Camail> when i went around the ship to get to the entrance he usually said hello
21:50:40 <Phearlock> Such a nice snek.
21:50:51 <Camail> bitey, but nice
21:59:31 <Phearlock> lul
22:00:04 <Camail> sean please
22:06:24 <Phearlock> I mean he just has to get to the point where he realizes the stasis rifle invalidates pretty much any threat and... well he'll still be scared but not quite-as-scared.
22:06:50 <Phearlock> Actually it does not invalidate standing in fire.
22:11:55 <Camail> sean should be a bit more reflective on his own fear so far
22:12:03 <Camail> he used to be terrified of reef backs
22:12:14 <Camail> the mere profile of one made him scream
22:12:48 <Camail> but this game is a perfect lesson in using learning to combat fear
22:13:24 <Phearlock> Yeah

23:43:16 <Camail> subnautica devs did a smart move giving the base game for free then releasing an expansion
23:43:25 <Camail> i didnt put 2 and 2 together until just now
