09:50:34 <DoT|Phone1> hey Reif
09:54:49 <Cane> Hiya everyone. <3
09:55:13 <DoT|Phone1> hey cane <3
09:55:25 <Runbunny> Hai Reif and Cane.
09:57:49 <DoT|Phone1> cane, I'm constantly lost in dota, I just buy items that are recommended with no real idea about stat bonuses and effects
09:58:09 <DoT|Phone1> not to mention what builds into what so you can plan ahead
09:58:18 <DoT|Phone1> so many items
09:58:47 <Cane> DoT|Phone1, that's where most people are, they buy stuff "because it's in the recommended guide."
09:59:29 <DoT|Phone1> I hate it though. I need to know why but there is so much to try learn
09:59:50 <Cane> In Day[9] Learns Dota, in episodes 2-3 I believe they go over items and mechanics, especially episode 3.
10:00:01 <Cane> They talk about making item choices.
10:00:09 <Cane> But the problem is just, you need to know the various items in the game.
10:00:24 <Cane> I actually made my own guides for Broodmother, Invoker, and one other hero I forget
10:00:36 <Cane> Just so I could look at every single item and think about why I might want them.
10:00:45 <Cane> Using existing guides as starting points, but not set in stone.
10:00:57 <DoT|Phone1> yea. in about half way through ep 3, they talk a lot about it, but it's hard to follow without a knowledge of items
10:01:12 <Cane> Right, I watched the first 3 episodes when I was really new, and got SOME stuff out of it.
10:01:36 <Cane> Then I made several guides just to put together a whole ton of items, went to Dotabuff to find out what items are used on what heroes
10:01:53 <Cane> Then re-watched the first 3 episodes and it was like a whole new level of understanding.
10:02:03 <Cane> But that took several days.
10:04:33 <Cane> With Invoker mid, I have an idea of what items to get in the early game against what heroes, but that's about it.
10:05:04 <Cane> Once it gets to the lategame, my ONLY thought process so far is stuff like "if they have a lot of physical damage get Shiva's."
10:05:19 <Cane> Anything more detailed, don't have that yet.
10:05:30 <Cane> Oh, and if they have lots of stuns, get BKB.
10:08:14 <DoT|Phone1> isn't bkb spell immunity?
10:09:10 <Runbunny> Sure
10:09:13 <Runbunny> is
10:09:24 <Runbunny> But there are stuff that goes through BKB.
10:10:12 <Cane> Yep, so if you're up against a lot of disable spells that render you useless, BKB is better. If you're up against stuff like Doom or other single target damage crap that's hard to deal with, Linken's might be better.
10:10:59 <Cane> https://i.imgur.com/SZ0eUbi.png
10:11:02 <Runbunny> Lotus orb is also really powerful in that regard.
10:11:28 <Cane> Oh yeah.
10:13:09 <Runbunny> It can purge off stuns from allies but it can also be cast preemptively to reflect spells and discourage enemy spell usage.
10:13:54 <Runbunny> Dota boils down to one simple concept really.
10:14:20 <Runbunny> You need to trick your 4 teammates into defeating the 5 enemies.
10:16:20 <reification> hello dot, cane, runbun
10:16:29 <Runbunny> Reif :3
10:16:37 <Cane> Runbunny, yup.

10:18:38 <Cane> Hia reif. <3
10:19:36 <Runbunny> Dota would be great if it weren't for all the other people that have to voice their opinions on what you do.
10:20:13 <Cane> <Runbunny> Dota would be great if it weren't for all the other people
10:20:15 <Cane> You could have stopped right there.
10:20:35 <Runbunny> Yeah, I considered that :P
10:33:01 <Cane> DoT|Phone1, seriously let me know if you want to vs bots. We can talk items and maybe get more out of it.
10:33:09 <DoT|Phone1> this is why we need full stacks
10:33:49 <DoT|Phone1> yea cane. maybe tonight. last hight was my first game in years so needed to just even relearn buttons
10:34:10 <Rawr|Fone> I could play tonight maybe, I don't have a microphone anymore though
10:35:17 <DoT|Phone1> but I want to hear Rawr voice.
10:36:22 <Cane> Rawr micless is sad Rawr.
10:36:37 <Cane> You'll just have to type shit like a caveman.
10:38:00 <reification> i have overwatch scrim this evening but do ping me
10:47:31 <DoT|Phone1> Will do
10:50:54 <Cane> Wow, we could have 4 people sucking against bots instead of 1, what a night this will be.
10:51:26 <DoT|Phone1> I could bully Skram as well if you like
10:51:29 <DoT|Phone1> and dubs easy
10:51:48 <Cane> Dub can play with 150ms ping? Impressive.
10:59:16 <DoT|Phone1> easy
