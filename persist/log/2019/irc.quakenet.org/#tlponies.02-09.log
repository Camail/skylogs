11:43:25 <Runbunny> That is one massive lad.
11:44:09 <Runbunny> Cheese and bed sheets have always been a dangerous combination.
11:54:02 <skrm> oh lawd
12:56:10 <Rawr|Fone> üê¥üê¥üê¥
13:02:23 <Dot`> im back
13:02:30 <Dot`> skrm, i bought cheese
13:03:04 <Dot`> a chillie gouder from holland, a smokey chedder and a really good mature cheddar
13:09:50 <Dot`> i failed to get a haircut though
13:22:58 <Dot`> rawr, where is skram
13:31:20 <Runbunny> Yes.
13:31:24 <Runbunny> He went to get cheese.
13:33:14 <skrm> sometimes i do work
13:33:15 <skrm> when at work
13:34:16 <Dot`> nah
13:34:32 <skrm> whaddayamean nah
13:35:29 <Dot`> hearing about the cheese i bought is more important
13:35:49 <Runbunny> I enjoy a good Gouda, it has been years though.
13:35:55 <skrm> fair enough
13:40:55 <skrm> i managed to convice the light of my life, the lunch lady, to buy brie every week
13:47:01 <Runbunny> French peasant brie?
13:55:52 <Rawr|Fone> Dot cheese is the worst
13:56:14 <Dot`> rawr i worry for you
13:56:20 <Dot`> are you even a person?
13:56:28 <Dot`> no coffee AND no cheese
13:59:32 <Runbunny> Rawr is a dog.
13:59:36 <Runbunny> Can confirm.
13:59:50 <Runbunny> Good boy at that even.
13:59:59 <Rawr|Fone> üê∂üê∂üê∂
14:01:55 <Runbunny> I assume the emoji that I can't see is agree'ing with me.
14:02:06 <Dot`> is dogs
14:03:47 <Rawr|Fone> Cheese is the worst version of milk
14:06:45 <Runbunny> oh boy, you have never tried "k√¶rne m√¶lk" then.
14:08:16 <Runbunny> Google tells me it's cultured buttermilk in english.
14:08:33 <Dot`> so.. off milk
14:13:43 <Runbunny> Literally the worst version of milk.
14:14:35 <Rawr|Fone> That is not for drinking Anders
14:15:56 <reification> ppl drink skimmed milk and that is an abomination
14:21:04 <Runbunny> It was in elementary school.
14:21:27 <Runbunny> I think that english skimmed milk is different from the skimmed milk we have here.
14:21:54 <Dot`> runbun, one of the team leaders in my office is danish
14:22:23 <reification> what fat % does yours have runbun?
14:22:34 <Runbunny> Next are you going to tell me that he betrayed your family as well as he's sharing my name?
14:22:43 <Runbunny> Let me confirm Reif.
14:23:27 <Dot`> i think his name is Carson
14:23:50 <Runbunny> That's not very danish.
14:24:08 <Dot`> its probably proonounced very wrong by northern english ppl
14:24:44 <Runbunny> reification, the one I drink (eat on oatmeal) is 0,4%. when I was younger I got the 0,1%.
14:25:08 <Dot`> carston maybe actually... 
14:25:18 <Dot`> i havtn actually seen it written
14:25:20 <Runbunny> Which was probably promoted due to "fat" in food being a big no no back then.
14:25:24 <Runbunny> Karsten?
14:25:32 <Dot`> maybe that
14:25:36 <Runbunny> Is pretty danish.
14:25:53 <Dot`> english ppl dont like to pronounce t's
14:26:00 <Dot`> they save them all for Tea
14:26:03 <Runbunny> :D
14:26:08 <Rawr|Fone> Karsten Torbj√∂rn?
14:26:24 <reification> those are both terrible runbun. drinking that disgusting grey water is bad for your soul
14:26:28 <Runbunny> Dot is a Bj√∏rn.
14:26:35 <reification> drink proper full fat milk
14:26:38 <Dot`> funny tihng rawr, My brother is called Torben and I am Bjorn
14:27:04 <Rawr|Fone> ü§îü§î
14:27:31 <Runbunny> It's white though Reif.
14:27:42 <Runbunny> I think full milk is too much.
14:27:49 <Runbunny> What do you think Rawr?
14:28:29 <Rawr|Fone> Mellanmj√∂lk is perfect
14:29:11 <reification> all your ancestors drank proper milk so you could have lactose tolerance and now you spurn your inheritance runbun
14:29:17 <reification> smh
14:29:46 <Runbunny> O:
14:30:53 <Runbunny> "s√∏dm√¶lk" is too much though. I only really use it when I cook Rice porridge (1-2 times a year).
14:34:34 <reification> i assume it's called skummj√∂lk because you have to be scummy to sell it as milk
14:37:40 <Rawr|Fone> Pretty valid theory
14:56:20 <skrm> casuals
14:56:29 <skrm> i just put my face on some cow tiddies

20:45:23 <Dot`> i looke dit up, you actually cant buy it
20:45:38 <Dot`> one company owns the rights to LotR, one owns the game
20:45:43 <Dot`> so no one can sell it

22:07:33 <Micen> i did miss that!
22:15:14 <Micen> too many good RPG shows and RPG adjacent shows to watch!
22:17:21 <Dot`> i watched a bit of his DM prep but i know nothing of magic lore
22:20:25 <Camail> well, this is specifically ravnica lore
22:20:38 <Camail> there are a lot of planes and planeswalkers that aren't part of the scope
22:20:53 <Camail> this setting is about ravnica, their guilds, and their leaders
22:21:09 <Golly> is dimir like the most evil one?
22:21:18 <Camail> rakdos, probably
22:21:20 <Dot`> i didnt even know that much cam
22:21:30 <Camail> thats why i am telling you, dort
22:22:01 <Camail> rakdos is black/red and very angry at everything
22:22:30 <Camail> dimir is blue/black they are more calculating in their evilness
22:22:41 <Camail> which means they do less overtly evil rampaging
22:22:56 <Dot`> so guilds are each a mix of 2 colours? is there lore reason, do the 'colours' even exist in actual lore
22:23:10 <Dot`> or more that they will say angels and you will know they mean white
22:24:00 <Camail> colors are the magic mana colors
22:24:05 <DuB`> ANGELS
22:24:11 <Camail> they have "color identities" green is nature, big things
22:24:28 <Camail> white is healing, angels, protection, restraints
22:24:41 <Camail> blue is control, counterspells, wizardry
22:24:45 <Camail> stuff like that
22:25:12 <Dot`> my lore knowledge extends to, green nature, fire burn, black death, blue sneaky/hated, white angels
22:25:12 <Golly> also; bullshit
22:25:13 <Camail> each color has its own personality, and they mix together to influence the perosnalities of the guilds
22:25:59 <Dot`> ok, so the colours do have a direct correlation in actual lore
22:26:14 <Camail> very much so
22:26:15 <Dot`> and a guild is a mix of 2 of them?
22:26:17 <Camail> yup
22:26:25 <Dot`> that helps
22:27:11 <Camail> there are 10 guilds
22:27:48 <Bio> neigh
22:27:51 <Camail> there have been 3 sets in ravnica, so those stories have advanced as their own mini narrative inside the big scope of mtg as a whole
22:28:29 <Bio> theres 3 color guilds too
22:28:35 <Camail> not guilds
22:28:58 <Camail> the wedges have something associated with them
22:29:01 <Camail> clans, i think
22:29:08 <Camail> clans of tarkir? its been awilhe i cant recall
22:29:19 <Micen> clans yeah
22:29:28 <Micen> Tarkir is where i got into magic for a bit
22:29:36 <Camail> yea, thats a different plane
22:30:14 <Camail> ravnica wont go into tarkir stuff
22:30:54 <Bio> ?biostream
22:30:56 <Bio> rando
22:31:03 <Camail> Dot`  in general any time you see a guild where one of the colors is black, it's gonna be evil
22:31:23 <Camail> white is almost always good, white/black is complicated, especially now
22:31:30 <Camail> because their new leader is less evil(?)
22:31:42 <Bio> White black = the big S U C C
22:31:54 <Micen> White black is where i live when I play
22:32:19 <Golly> its pretty good in the newest set in draft
22:32:43 <Dot`> i only watch smooth jazz streams bio
22:32:44 <Camail> i haven't looked at draft much

22:35:30 <Dot`> its scary to think all the things i said that they took seriosly...
22:36:04 <Camail> dry sarcasm is hard to pick up on if you aren't that good of a friends with someone
