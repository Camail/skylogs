01:38:01 <skram> could we push it back about 3 hours maybe
01:38:12 <skram> i have some post-nap cat watching to do also
01:38:19 <Bio> hmm
01:38:22 <Bio> thinking
01:38:34 <Bio> skrm i've found myself in the part of the youtubes
01:38:40 <Bio> where the japanese guy makes knives
01:38:45 <Bio> outta weird shit
01:38:48 <skram> its my favorite part
01:38:52 <skram> did you see his milk knife yet
01:38:56 <Bio> yus
01:39:24 <Bio> hes making a knife out of smoke skrm
01:39:28 <Bio> S M O K E
01:39:30 <skram> what a cool dude
01:40:32 <Camail> turns out if you have professional grade whetstones, everything is knifeable 
01:40:42 <Camail> i am back, and better than ever
01:40:51 <Camail> cuz i'm a robot now
01:40:53 <skram> ill be the judge of that
01:43:36 <skram> I dont understand the steps in the milk knife video
01:43:50 <skram> whys he mixing milk with strong alcohol
01:44:06 <Camail> something something coagulation?
01:46:52 <skram> looks kinda like its curdled
01:47:46 <Camail> i'm guessing either the lactose is coagulating, or their is an actual precipitate in there
01:49:37 <skram> i suppose he's just dissolving the fats
01:49:55 <Camail> well he's using an acid, and milk is basic
01:50:06 <Camail> there's most likely some kind of chemical reaction happening
01:51:01 <skram> i suppose
01:51:17 <skram> acetic acid is just vinegar though i think
01:57:22 <Camail> well, its in vinegar
01:57:58 <Camail> most of the video isn't about making a knife
01:58:06 <Camail> which i guess is good
01:58:30 <skram> most of its about making a knife handle
01:58:31 <skram> i think
02:01:35 <DuB`> It's an important bit
02:01:47 <DuB`> Don't want your hand to get cut!
02:02:26 <skram> maybe i do

04:04:35 <Runbunny> Yeh.
04:04:39 <Camail> had a really good group and got sooo many shearclaws
04:04:48 <Runbunny> True gae bolg as well?
04:04:52 <Camail> ya
04:04:59 <Runbunny> I have only defeated it once :/
04:05:04 <DuB`> ur a gae bolg
04:05:09 <Camail> now all i need is handicraft decorations
04:05:27 <Camail> i've beat it twice, but i have probably tried more times than you run
04:05:38 <Camail> tbf doing the special event version is terrible
04:05:44 <Camail> none of the good players join those
04:06:00 <Camail> because there's by default one person who hasn't beat the fight
04:06:17 <Camail> once i started doing the optional mission the quality of player skyrocketed
04:08:06 <Camail> most of our damage came from shield boy mounting
04:08:10 <Camail> i wasnt in the air at all
04:08:25 <Camail> its just not worth it most of the time
04:10:05 <Camail> Runbunny  you really should wear the temporal mantle
04:10:15 <Camail> its essentially 60 seconds of invincibility
04:10:25 <Camail> it auto-dodges monster attacks
04:10:52 <Runbunny> Ah right.
04:11:26 <Runbunny> Does it dodge the ecliptic meteor?
04:21:11 <Camail> no
04:21:21 <Camail> it only dodges attack done by the monsters body
04:21:32 <Camail> so i think any kind of explosion still fucks you?
04:21:41 <Camail> haven't tried it vs basil yet

21:02:26 <Rawr|Fone> You are a neat pony zounds
21:02:50 <Zounds> thank you for your nonsense compliment rawr
21:03:35 <DuB`> Jeez https://twitter.com/ATLReign/status/1081656530108325888
21:04:51 <Zounds> fancy house
21:05:09 <Zounds> Teamhouses must be such a pain after a while though
21:05:11 <Zounds> fancy or not
21:07:19 <skram> yeh what a pain living in a friggin mansion
21:08:07 <Zounds> Yeah living with the people you work with
21:09:35 <Zounds> Imagine having family stay over or trying to have a romantic evening or something
21:10:09 <skram> well thats true
21:11:46 <Zounds> Apartments and a practice facility would be way preferable for me
21:11:58 <Zounds> However I'm a bit older than OWL players so that's probably a major factor
21:19:04 <Camail> people normalize to quality of life really quickly
21:19:15 <Camail> so a mansion quickly just becomes a house, whether we like it or not
21:54:20 <Runbunny> It would seem that upstair neighbours are determined to westle.
21:54:40 <skram> they probably fuckin
21:56:14 <Runbunny> Nah that sounds vastly different from this.
22:01:47 <reification> maybe they are either so inept or advanced you cannot recognise
22:07:14 <skram> yeah its not like in one of your animes
22:07:43 <Runbunny> Too bad.
22:07:58 <skram> its probably for the best
22:07:58 <Runbunny> Well I am going to go sleep.
22:08:13 <skram> no
22:09:07 <skram> how dare he
