01:38:39 <DuB`> It took like 40 minutes of flat our running but I finallyi reached the north end of the map, I think
01:38:51 <DuB`> Went through like 7 crazy biomes I hadn't seen yet
01:39:00 <DuB`> ... map is way bigger than I thought
01:39:04 <DuB`> And a miniboss fight!
01:39:19 <Dot> oh?
01:39:28 <Dot> there must be more weapons then
01:39:41 <Dot> that just the zap stick
01:39:47 <Dot> than*
01:39:57 <DuB`> I brought it down with zap, but went through like 40hp of healing :P
01:40:08 <Dot> hahaha

02:44:54 <DuB`> But so much to see!
02:45:13 <DuB`> Next time I'll make it there and back again
02:45:59 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/day9tv
02:46:02 <Camail> prime time freak outs
02:49:51 <DuB`> rofl
02:50:48 <Phearlock> What a guy
03:33:20 <DuB`> .tell skram These are lovely, v relaxe https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF8HpP-lEx8W9OlMSOW6kGA
03:36:47 <skram> dub i shouldve been in bed hours ago
03:38:10 <skram> now im looking at a 2 hour long video of some guy shoveling snow and a dog
03:39:00 <Camail> didnt you spend last night angrily shoveling snow
03:39:05 <Camail> why do you want to relive this
03:39:17 <DuB`> Go slepp
03:39:20 <DuB`> Watch tomoro :P
03:44:42 <Camail> dub would you want to try path of exile if we could start a group
03:44:51 <Camail> thinking of doing some research but i wanna gauge tlp interest
03:45:06 <DuB`> I did some with my brother last season
03:45:32 <DuB`> I always fall out of interest after playing like 10-15 hours, dunno why
03:45:40 <Camail> hmmm
03:46:05 <DuB`> Something about your entire build needing to be only a single skill and using literally only that for your entire playthrough...
03:46:33 <Camail> yea that sounds kinda garbo, which is why i want to look at a few builds and find a fun one
03:46:54 <Camail> though i do play condemn crus
03:46:59 <Camail> so like...thats basically the same
03:47:36 <Camail> d3 kinda has th same problem, thinking about it
03:47:49 <Camail> the skill progression through leveling is much more varied, tho

18:28:27 <Zounds> was no bother really
18:29:50 <Zounds> heard a lot more spoken welsh than I expected
18:30:03 <Zounds> must be some crossover between welsh die hards and rugby fans
18:30:13 <skram> what does spoken welsh sound like

18:30:30 <Zounds> if that makes any sense at all
18:30:42 <skram> no
18:30:50 <Zounds> Lots of y sounds

18:31:57 <skram> somehow a bit similar to icelandic
18:32:42 <skram> only spoken though, written it makes no sense at all and is probably a made up language
