01:45:11 <DuB`> skram why do I love this "1hr of random general chat with James May" video so much
01:45:18 <DuB`> I want JM to be my grandpa
02:03:54 <skram> james may is pretty funny in a weird old person way
02:05:37 <skram> He should do a podcast about old people stuff honestly
02:06:08 <skram> He's got some pretty cool documentary series about cars and one about assembling things
02:32:59 <DuB`> Watched all the assembler already haha

16:56:20 <skram> anyone else having trouble with steam
16:56:29 <Camail> mine seems fine
16:56:43 <Camail> usually the friends list goes offline if there are problems
16:56:49 <Camail> unless its a different kind of fuckery
16:57:18 <Camail> i'm guessing its an issue with eu servers
16:58:38 <skram> probably
16:58:45 <skram> wont let me go in offline mode either
17:03:42 <Camail> hmm, pretty much all non-us servers are offline
17:03:50 <Camail> go to singapore
17:07:04 <skram> hmm
17:07:17 <skram> i dont think i could change server region without actually opening steam
17:08:34 <Camail> usually if it fails to log in it lets you do offline mode, but if that roesn't even work then ur fucked
17:08:46 <skram> ya i dont have saved credentials on

17:17:37 <DuB`> I need to know
17:18:12 <DuB`> omg Runbunny lolol
17:19:48 <Camail> dont worry dub, you came out of the cryogenic tube after you were bought, and will be sealed in before returning
17:19:53 <Camail> you won't need to know

17:27:14 <Camail> skram get steam working so we can poe
17:27:45 <Camail> you might be able to start poe without steam, actually
17:31:43 <Runbunny> My friend doesn't run it through steam.
17:32:12 <Runbunny> It's very possible, has its own launcher and everything and doesn't take 10 years to apply a 20 mb patch.
17:32:46 <Camail> i dunno if the steam DLed exe hooks into the steam launcher
17:33:07 <Camail> it doesn't necessarily have to, i think i've run games straight through that file before but i cant remember
17:33:15 <Camail> but that might be because i have credentials remembered
17:33:35 <Camail> pretty sure it asks steam for stuff, still
17:34:23 <Runbunny> Yeah I think so. You would need to download the non-steam version.
