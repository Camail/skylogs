18:39:01 <Camail> the fact that apple owns me.com is saddening
18:39:23 <skram> Why's that, camail?
18:39:31 <Camail> its a cool email flex tho
18:39:38 <Camail> i dunno, it's just so simple and could be cool
18:39:41 <Camail> but it's just a redirect
18:40:49 <Camail> i was just emailing someone with an email that was @me.com and i was hoping it was an email service or something
18:41:08 <Camail> or that they were an old school windows ME fan
18:41:20 <skram> you should ask him because now i kinda want that too
18:41:33 <Camail> no, he must've took it when he worked for apple
18:42:14 <Camail> it's either a staff email network or an upper management one
18:42:28 <Camail> oh shit nevermind
18:42:48 <Camail> i think its just a proprietary apple thing
18:42:56 <Camail> but anyone might be able to do it
18:43:40 <reification> i'm sure me.com addresses were easily available from apple in the past at least
18:44:27 <Camail> @me comes from an app they bought out, apparently
18:45:59 <Camail> hmmm
18:46:10 <Camail> i think @me.com is deprecated
18:47:20 <Camail> yea apple bought mobileme and merged it into icloud, so maybe any me.com addresses are from people who had those accounts
18:47:51 <Camail> 2012 was the cutoff date
18:48:00 <Camail> mystery: solved
