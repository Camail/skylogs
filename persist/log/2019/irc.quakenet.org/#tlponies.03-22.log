20:42:05 <Runbunny> Best decision all week.
20:42:14 <Phearlock> Magical refrigerated materials for summoing pizza.
20:42:26 <Phearlock> summoning*
20:43:12 <DuB`> Some summoning rituals aren't high-level enough and fail to summon the pineapple along with the pizza, but are still serviceable.

20:47:40 <DuB`> Smoked gouda so smoky it makes ya cough
20:47:54 <Runbunny> That sounds horrid :/
20:48:11 <Camail> inject smoke directly into the cheese
20:48:17 <Rawr|Fone> Cheese also seems to be popular ponyfood
20:48:42 <DuB`> Just a teeny slice of that, and some more mellow milky cheese to make it satisfying
20:48:42 <DuB`> MM
20:48:45 <Camail> cheese is a popular white person food, and we are mostly white
20:49:32 <Camail> we lucked out on the lactose tolerance 3 thousand years ago

23:30:51 <Bio> 1 GAME
23:30:55 <Bio> 1 APEX CHAMPION LORD
23:35:44 <Bio> I LIKE EM BIG
23:35:47 <Bio> I LIKE EM CHUNKY
23:35:50 <Bio> I LIKE EM BIG
23:38:50 <Camail> Runbunny  the biggest change for me at this point is dropping fractured items from non-decaying memories
23:39:07 <Camail> having to do 3 laps just to start getting them is kinda annoying
23:39:16 <Runbunny> ahh yeah :/
23:39:18 <Camail> and really doesn't make sense from a lore perspective
23:39:38 <Camail> but then again, i havent done much of this league
23:39:47 <Camail> literally having to learn every old league's mechanics
23:40:11 <Camail> its intimidating but also incredibly fun
23:59:24 <Camail> skram would like delve because 1. he's a dwarf and 2. mine _shaft_
