19:49:45 <Dot> thats weird dub
19:50:36 <DuB`> I'm supposed to help out with a recruiting event on campus for my new company and need to look official :P
19:50:52 <Dot> ooo. fancy
19:50:55 <Dot> wear a tie
19:50:56 <Zounds> they already have you recruiting?
19:50:58 <Dot> and a scarf!
19:50:59 <Zounds> they act fast
19:51:09 <Zounds> are u sure it's a company and not a cult
19:51:10 <skram> DuB` did you join a MLM thing
19:51:20 <skram> are you working for mary kay or something now
19:51:52 <Zounds> "What's it like to work at $companyname?"
19:51:58 <DuB`> Just as a representative to stand there and say "hi yes the food is over there"
19:52:01 <DuB`> Basically
19:52:06 <Zounds> "No idea I've barely been there myself"
19:52:10 <DuB`> Haha
19:53:54 <Runbunny> Noes Dub. MLM's are bad.
19:54:25 <DuB`> Pretty positive PwC isn't mlm :P
19:54:28 <DuB`> preeeetty
19:54:40 <Runbunny> Well that is not certain.
19:54:50 <Runbunny> Is there like 1 guy who is the top dog?
19:54:51 <DuB`> o dear
19:55:13 <Runbunny> and he has tons of employees under him?
19:55:20 <DuB`> Uh
19:55:22 <Runbunny> and it shapes up to a pyramid.
19:55:25 <DuB`> Well there are partners
19:55:48 <DuB`> And they say to one partner "sure you can be the partner in charge but we are also partners"
19:56:21 <Runbunny> Do they refer to eachother and everyone else as "hun"
19:56:28 <skram> thats what they WANT you to think
19:56:30 <skram> hahah
19:56:34 <skram> anders pls
19:56:38 <DuB`> Certainly not in NYC
19:56:41 <DuB`> ;D
19:56:48 <Runbunny> Jonas, I have been to a MLM meeting once.
19:56:53 <Runbunny> I was nearly dragged in.
19:57:35 <DuB`> Did you get called "hun"?
19:57:42 <skram> eew
19:58:09 <Runbunny> I did not. This particular MLM sold "phone plans" or something like that.
19:59:05 <Runbunny> But it involved recruiting, and as I wasn't particularly inclined to join, I figured I would have a hard time getting others to join. 
19:59:18 <Runbunny> Plus most people have phone plans.
19:59:49 <Dot> Runbun, you are laready part of this cult, you cant join another
19:59:50 <Runbunny> It's too bad I don't recall the name. I would have liked to look them up now.
19:59:53 <Dot> its in the contract
20:00:03 <Camail> runbun hunt?
20:00:05 <Runbunny> This is a cult?
20:00:07 <Runbunny> Yes.
20:00:26 <Camail> getting water, then kill time
20:01:48 <Rawr|Fone> I remember an mlm selling energy drinks
20:01:54 <BioPone> Mlem
20:02:05 <Rawr|Fone> Some people I knew lost so much money
20:02:16 <BioPone> Sounds like a scam imo
20:03:41 <Rawr|Fone> Well spotted üÖ±Ô∏èio
20:03:55 <Camail> hmm, jury is still out
20:03:56 <Dot> well no one else wants to play dub :(
