14:04:47 <skram> mountain passes sometimes but some mountain crossings are kept open even 5 meters deep
14:05:56 <skram> but its snowing a lot each year so i guess we have more infrastructure to deal with it
14:06:00 <DoT|Phone> every side road, back road, suburb road is always open and gritted?
14:06:03 <Zounds> skram add z0undz on Origin when you get a chance

22:25:03 <Dot> cris
22:25:43 <Cane> So some days ago, Miracle played Juggernaut offlane and went for a magic damage build with Radiance and EBlade. Ladder was apparently busted for days with people trying it.
22:25:56 <Cane> A few hours ago, OG played Invoker position 4 roaming support.
22:26:09 <Cane> So now there are offlane Jug and Invoker players.
22:26:16 <Cane> And ladder is fucked and I'm dying laughing.
22:26:27 <skram> I trust miracle- to decide whats best for me
22:29:20 <Runbunny> People in mobas have always been prone to do what the pros do. They just fail to imitate the teamwork and communication aspect and instead focus on "player did this with this hero, surely this is the new way to play said hero"

22:52:14 <Zounds> though obviously you miss more pellets
22:54:04 <Runbunny> Peacemaker has deceptively long range, especially if you get the charge thingy for it.
