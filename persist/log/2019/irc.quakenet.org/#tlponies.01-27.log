00:51:04 <Runbunny> I don't think it's too bad.

01:04:14 <reification> though not technically an answer to my question :p
01:06:29 <Runbunny> I haven't been drinking.

16:53:09 <Runbunny> Dot I will teach you a famous technique.
16:53:21 <Runbunny> First thing you do is search for traps.
16:53:30 <Runbunny> Then you search for invisible traps.
