08:16:28 <DuB`> Dot!
08:16:53 <DuB`> I realized just as I was about to head to bed that 2/3 classes tomoro are cancelled, only have the 5pm one :P
08:16:57 <DuB`> So I stayed up late ;D
08:20:46 <DoT|Phone> you rebel
08:21:15 <DoT|Phone> what you been up to dub
08:25:43 <DuB`> Nuffin
08:27:38 <DuB`> School is kinda funny
08:27:57 <DuB`> While the content has gradually gotten more "advanced" over the last few years, the work has gotten far easier
08:28:22 <DuB`> All I had over the weekend was a pair of 200ish-word writeups >_>
08:34:05 <DoT|Phone> easy life

08:51:20 <DoT|Phone> hi Micen
08:51:31 <DoT|Phone> Rawr, they are making a wheel of time series
08:51:39 <DoT|Phone> should I panic now?
08:51:44 <Micen> hasnt that been in production hell for years?
08:52:00 <Micen> or is this the amazon one?
08:55:04 <DoT|Phone> I recall hearing about one ages ago, but this news seems new
08:55:50 <Micen> yeah, i think its amazon that has okayed it. But they also okayed a Dark Tower series at a similar time
08:56:12 <Micen> i need to finish WoT
08:58:38 <Micen> I think i got into book 6. 
08:59:52 <DoT|Phone> Yea. the series really slows down around book 5/6
09:00:10 <DoT|Phone> but starts to pick back up and the last few are amazing
09:00:10 <Micen> my book backlog is huge right now
09:00:46 <DoT|Phone> while it's a tragedy he died before finishing the books, his choice of authors to finish it was perfect
09:00:55 <Micen> I have WoT, Sword of Truth, Kingkiller Chronicles, book 2 of Ratcatchers. 
09:01:09 <DoT|Phone> and they really have New life to the series while sticking to his themes
09:06:40 <DoT|Phone> you also need to go practice last hitting Micen
09:07:17 <Micen> i do, apparently 12 years of not having to need that specific control kills those skills. 
09:07:43 <Micen> League and hots both require so much less skill and focus in that reagard
09:07:49 <Micen> regard*
10:11:29 <Rawr|Fone> DoT DoT DoT
10:11:51 <Rawr|Fone> I doubt it is going to be a good series
10:19:00 <DoT|Phone> I do too :(
10:27:51 <DoT|Phone> how are you today Rawr
10:28:13 <Rawr|Fone> Goooood goood

16:32:21 <DoT|Phone> great to hear cane
16:33:24 <DoT|Phone> I was down the whole of last week, I blame the lack of Sun, just couldn't get any real joy from anything
16:35:16 <Cane> Aw, that sucks to hear. Lack of sun is normal to Norwegians so that's not what's been causing it for me. I dunno what did it exactly.
16:35:49 <Cane> I was hoping playing a bunch of Dota with TLP this weekend would help, but it didn't really.
16:36:02 <BioPhone> Moar memes imo
16:36:19 <DoT|Phone> inhouses are never a great solution to sadness
16:36:49 <Cane> One day I'm going to acquire incredible power, whether through dark magics or alien visitors showing up in my back yard and telling me I'm the chosen one.
16:36:59 <Cane> I will use my powers for benevolence, and to destroy memes, which is more benevolence.
16:37:28 <Cane> That's what I think of your memes Bio.
16:37:38 <Cane> Your streams are still fun tho.
16:38:12 <Cane> And DoT|Phone, apparently not.
16:38:25 <Cane> I'll stick to playing when I'm not miserable, I think.
16:38:36 <Cane> Which is most of the time, thankfully.
16:39:03 <skram> evenin pals
16:39:06 <DoT|Phone> I think going vs real ppl as a full stack will be fun
16:39:20 <DoT|Phone> but vs eachother , meh
16:39:31 <Cane> Ello skram.
16:39:34 <DoT|Phone> Did you have work Skram?
16:39:41 <skram> not yet
16:39:57 <BioPhone> Pls sir, not my memes
16:40:00 <skram> i leave in like 4 hours
16:41:59 <DoT|Phone> That means we won't get to game this week
16:43:07 <Cane> Man, Broodmother is just forever a last pick only thing. If you pick second last, there are way too many heroes that just hard counters her.
16:43:35 <Cane> And most of the time those heroes are in meta anyway.

16:58:02 <Cane> Rough weekend.
16:58:20 <skram> thats why winter is the best part of the year
16:58:30 <Cane> Hell yeah.
16:58:45 <Cane> Well, fall for me, since I can take my midnight walks without freezing to death.
16:59:26 <skram> Boy let me tell you about a thing called a jacket :p
16:59:28 <BioPhone> I have a new SNES controller coming this week. Ensures PB rando runs. Look forward to that bois
16:59:46 <Cane> skram, det finnes ikke d√•rlig v√¶r, bare d√•rlige kl√¶r.
16:59:56 <skram> This is the truth
17:00:23 <skram> wait do you live far enough north for the darkness 4ever thing?
17:01:22 <Cane> Yup.
17:01:38 <Cane> Winter means zero sun.
17:01:42 <Cane> Hence my vitamin D deficiency last year.

17:02:28 <skram> Even I have to take vitamin D supplements and im just a dang s√∏ring :D
17:03:19 <skram> There were almost 5 hours of sun today
17:03:22 <Cane> Yeah, I learned last year that the ministry of health recommends that *all* people in Norway take daily vitamin D supplements since we actually just don't get enough sun.
17:03:23 <skram> Maybe. I was sleeping then.
17:03:36 <Cane> The sun has returned here too! Most of the day is still pretty dark though.
17:03:56 <Cane> Currently pitch black.
17:03:58 <skram> I do tran
17:04:09 <skram> its the worst part of my day but its good for you apparently
17:04:10 <Cane> Same, or those pill equivalents.
17:04:19 <Cane> I hate the aftertaste and the burping of tran.
17:04:31 <Cane> So yeah, not fun, but it's that or be so lethargic you can't function.
17:06:25 <Runbunny> Tran is just omega-3 no?
17:06:52 <Cane> Essentially, so I usually take them in pill form, to avoid the aftertaste and burping.
17:07:01 <Cane> Apothecary assured me it works equally well so.
17:07:02 <DoT|Phone> all I have is multivitamin, maybe I should get just straight vitamins-D supplement
17:07:26 <skram> Yeh tran has vit A and D too
17:07:38 <Runbunny> oh it does?
17:07:52 <Runbunny> My omega 3 only has omega 3.
17:09:39 <Cane> Our omega 3 supplements have additional stuff added to make it as good as tran.
17:09:42 <Cane> But they're more expensive.
17:09:51 <Cane> So with tran, you get more for your money.

21:05:24 <BioPhone> I have some legit skins for heroes in that game
21:07:05 <BioPhone> I took a long lunch to pley smash bros at werk with the lads, so I still got like 1.5h to go
21:16:13 <Camail> hey monster hunter is 34% off if anyone caresssss
21:18:41 <Cane> Camail, I heard Capcom produced a good game, can you confirm?
21:21:42 <Golly> i can as far as the resident evil 2 remake is concerned
21:27:04 <BioPhone> Oi
21:27:19 <BioPhone> The Phoenix Wright games are fantastic
21:27:23 <BioPhone> üòã
21:27:36 <Camail> Cane  the one that i put 260 hours into? yea is good
21:27:54 <Camail> it's nearing my sf5 numbers
21:30:17 <Camail> Cane if you've never played a monhun game and have no idea if you'd like the genre, Dauntless is a f2p of the genre that's a pretty good intro
21:30:26 <Camail> but tbh, its basically just like a dark souls boss rush
21:30:38 <Camail> thats the entire genre's core mechanic
21:30:51 <Camail> with a bunch of other cool stuff around it, but that's the heart
21:32:07 <Camail> and if you actually like being good at killing DS bosses vs just beating it once using all your estus and scrapping it out, then monhun is your genre
21:34:32 <Cane> Wow, that might be the best description of a game I've heard since Phear said "Starsector is like Mount & Blade in space".
21:34:39 <Cane> That turned out to be completely right.
21:37:47 <Camail> :)
21:49:21 <Cane> lol that's a first pick Terrorblade.
21:49:30 <Cane> Like, yeah, we're going TB, what are you gonna do about it bitch

21:50:18 <reification> to be fair that sounds pretty terrorblade
21:51:34 <Camail> dont make me slap u
21:51:40 <Camail> with my blade
21:51:41 <Camail> of terror
21:51:42 <Dot> im still amazed how bad the crit role caste are at knowing dnd rules
21:51:49 <Camail> dot no
21:51:51 <Camail> dont be that guy
21:52:05 <Camail> they literally do not read the rules, its no surprise
21:52:16 <Dot> cam soemtimes... i just want ppl to know thier own characters
21:52:22 <Camail> they DO
21:52:28 <Camail> they know how they feel, their motivations
21:52:32 <Camail> thats the character
21:52:37 <Camail> you want them to know their class
21:52:47 <Camail> which is secondary, even tertiary
21:53:01 <Camail> the only important part of dnd that they use is the d20
21:53:09 <Camail> the thing that can defy or reinforce narrative
21:53:47 <Camail> there are dnd streams that care about rules, but they're boring
21:54:26 <Camail> tal just makes sure no one dies, that's good enough
21:56:02 <Dot> cam, this is clearly a tochy subject for you, i was litrally just  meaning like recaling disingage works, im all up for thier narrative and weird things
21:57:06 <Camail> it's not touchy, i'm just being thorough
21:57:51 <Camail> but you dont seem to want to engage, which is fine
21:57:51 <reification> cam has exact opinions on things dot
21:58:13 <Camail> its kinda what i got my degree in
21:58:52 <reification> i'm afraid i can't remember what your degree was in...
21:59:03 <Camail> analytic philosophy
21:59:18 <reification> ah right that would make sense
22:03:03 <Dot> i just feel your on a diffrent tangent cam, im not knocking how crit role plays at all
22:03:22 <Camail> no i'm saying that you are expecting something from them that you shouldn't
22:03:33 <Camail> because their core interests don't line up with learning the game
22:04:19 <Camail> they dont remember to disengage because they aren't thinking about mechanical strategy, ever
22:04:28 <Camail> and i dont hold them to that standard
22:20:46 <Zounds> good degree for arguing on the internet
22:22:09 <Camail> I wish, good arguments are constructive and cooperative
22:22:30 <Camail> you aren't gonna have those on the internet, so i never engage with random people
22:25:30 <BioPhone> Time to come home
