15:19:31 <Rawr|Fone> I eat about 4500 calories a day and I'm barely gaining weight
15:19:56 <reification> runbun: do compound lifting of heavy weights; HIIT and hiking
15:20:11 <reification> that's quite impressive rawr
15:21:13 <reification> are you sure you haven't ingested tapeworm eggs at some point?
15:21:40 <BioPhone> Eat a shit load of sugar, that's how I gained weight lelel

15:22:09 <Rawr|Fone> Well I can't be sure reef
15:23:39 <Runbunny> Well I think my weight is pretty average for my height, but I want to improve constitution and overall strength.
15:24:03 <Runbunny> I'd chop lumber all day but I live in the middle of the city with no access to lumber.
15:28:17 <Rawr|Fone> Then do compound lifts

19:38:57 <Camail> once it hits 1.5 they are making the animation 44 minutes instead of 22
