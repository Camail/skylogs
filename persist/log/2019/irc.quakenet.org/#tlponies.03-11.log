23:03:47 <Camail> oh, apparently geek and sundry downsized after the split
23:04:01 <Camail> that company isn't gonna make it through the year
23:04:11 <Camail> which, in it's own way kinda sucks
23:04:56 <Camail> it played a key role in putting ttrpgs and table top games in general back into fashion
23:06:25 <DoT|Phone> That's rough
23:07:03 <DoT|Phone> do they really not have any other main shows now?
23:07:34 <DoT|Phone> did they all just slowly get ended during the time crit role had been on?
23:07:50 <DoT|Phone> with nothing new taking their place
23:13:23 <Camail> i mean, i think they put all their effort into CR i guess
23:13:25 <Bio> none of the shows were good, compared to CR
23:13:43 <Camail> because they had Wil wheaton's stuff
23:13:52 <Camail> the first few years had a lot of felicia day's friends
23:14:01 <Camail> then she stopped showing up, and they stopped showing up
23:14:24 <Camail> and CR happened at the perfect time, then they used that money to experiment with other nerd shows
23:14:55 <Camail> they tried A LOT of stuff, but the viewers just didn't want any of it
23:16:21 <Camail> in good news, the kickstarter is at ~7m so the penultimate episodes are 100% gonna be funded
23:16:35 <Camail> and the final 2 days will probably fund the last 2 episodes
23:17:08 <Camail> because that is A BIG incentive to fund the ending instead of leaving a cliffhanger
23:17:50 <Camail> seeing Vex get lasered on the ziggurat has to happen
23:18:31 <Camail> they probably won't animate the divine penises shredding mr briarwood
