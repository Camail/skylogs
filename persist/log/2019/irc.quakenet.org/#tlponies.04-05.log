20:04:27 <Camail> i got a bicep cramp from holding my phone so hard...i hate interviewing so much
20:05:04 <DuB`> O dear
20:05:34 <DuB`> I'm sure the interviewer was impressed by the sheer power of your grip which transmitted through the connection
20:06:14 <Camail> hopefully
20:09:26 <Dot`> maybe cam was the interviewer
20:09:31 <Dot`> very intimidating grip
20:09:56 <Camail> my handshakes crush souls
20:10:08 <Camail> and if i miss, soles
20:11:15 <DuB`> I'm imagining you going for a handshake, tripping, grabbing their ankle and squeezing their foot right off
20:11:40 <Camail> yes that was the image i had in mind
20:12:05 <Camail> maybe grabbing the arch and squeezing like a tube of toothpaste
20:12:21 <Camail> also a 30 minutes first interview felt like a 4 hour DM session
20:12:30 <Camail> i should really do some better prep
20:12:39 <Camail> is their a module for jobs
20:13:02 <DuB`> Become one with the stress
20:15:25 <Dot`> just do so many to the point you stop caring

20:22:35 <Camail> lasers are a fun weapon type
20:22:47 <Camail> the auto-aim girl + lasers = op
20:23:15 <Camail> the way they balance laser beams is that the recoil is impossible to handle, her special is an aimlock that negates it entirely
20:25:11 <DuB`> I don even remember the characters
