08:46:16 <DoT|Phone1> <3
08:47:33 <Cane> Hiya. <3
08:48:14 <DoT|Phone1> now I want to try Dota again cane, why have you done this?
08:48:26 <Cane> This rabbit hole is big enough for both of us.
08:49:08 <DoT|Phone1> May do some bot games when I get home and see how it feels
08:50:55 <DoT|Phone1> I ended up watching day9 learning dota last night too
08:53:29 <Cane> Yeah I'm still going through that series, while watching other Dota videos too.
08:53:33 <Cane> If you want to stomp some bots together let me know.
08:54:20 <Cane> Maybe we can get DuB to join us if he doesn't mind the lag.
08:54:24 <Cane> Since he offered to vs bots too.
08:54:50 <DoT|Phone1> Will do. and this is all your fault

12:41:57 <Cane> Hahaha you didn't know?
12:42:12 <Cane> Yeah, there's a swashbuckling duelist now.
12:42:15 <DoT|Phone> there are a fair few new hero's
12:42:37 <Bio> he has a sword!
12:42:56 <Bio> tiem 4 werk
12:43:04 <DoT|Phone> he is so fancy
12:43:10 <Cane> Pangolier's a really good Offlane hero, good mid and support too.
12:43:56 <skram> Its so windy out that i was almost unable to make the fire in my fire box :O
12:44:04 <skram> Is this what its like living on the coast, Cane?
12:45:13 <Cane> I'm not quite on the coast, we're at the end of a fjord and there's hills around us so it's all good.
12:47:07 <skram> sounds better, I moved to the top of the hill because waow i can see so far but who spends time lookin out the window anyway
12:47:30 <DoT|Phone> go live in a whole in the ground Skram
12:47:32 <Cane> DoT|Phone, I should try the new heroes like Pangolier and Dark Willow.
12:47:41 <Cane> The latter, everyone seems to be sleeping on, or not sure what to make of yet.
12:47:44 <DoT|Phone> it will be warmer too
12:47:55 <Cane> But it's a mischevous fairy with a wisp in a lantern.
12:47:57 <Cane> How could you go wrong?
12:48:09 <DoT|Phone> she does look fun cane
12:48:18 <skram> Probably dot. It was +7c in my bedroom this morning
12:48:34 <skram> was kinda nice actually but my nose was very cold
12:52:13 <Cane> skram, it's nice when the bedroom is really cold but I never want to get out of bed.
12:52:17 <Cane> "But it's cold out there."
12:53:07 <skram> Its not that useful if you actually have to get up :P
12:53:20 <Cane> It's a problem.
13:00:53 <CockRoach|42> did you sleep in a tent, skram?
13:02:21 <skram> i promise its an actual house
13:02:49 <CockRoach|42> 7C is a bit nippy
13:03:21 <skram> Windows are >100 years old and kinda shitty :(

13:07:23 <Cane> But skram, you're Norwegian, you should have heated floors anyway.
13:07:35 <Cane> Heated floors are actually the best thing ever.
13:07:58 <Cane> It's like -15* outside and I'm walking around barefoot, curling my toes against the warm floor.
13:08:13 <skram> The jerks that built this house in the late 1800s didnt put heated floors in :/

19:23:57 <Cane> Hell your Twitch was Bio_HoN for the longest time or something.
19:24:04 <BioPhone> It was fantastic
19:24:37 <BioPhone> It was at that moment where dota 2 wasn't a thing, and my dota interest was just climbing
19:25:09 <BioPhone> And I hadn't played war3 dota for a long enough time

19:28:05 <Zounds> I had played War3 dota but didn't really know wtf was going on

20:21:01 <Dot> skram
20:22:34 <skram> dot
20:22:41 <Dot> hows it going?
20:23:09 <skram> well enough lad
20:23:13 <skram> hows your day bean
20:23:21 <Dot> i played a solo bot game on dota, i even won
20:23:36 <Dot> work was fine, im just writign FDS's this week though
20:23:41 <Dot> all the documentation
20:25:51 <skram> whats FDS
20:26:04 <skram> FIRE DYNAMIC SIMULATION?
20:26:15 <Dot> Functional design schematic i think....
20:26:36 <Dot> its the thing we write to send back to the cutomer saying what thier thing will do in proper terms
20:26:57 <Dot> includes all alarms and set-points and things
20:27:08 <skram> never heard of such a thing
20:27:19 <BioPhone> What a good engineering document horse
20:28:01 <skram> so its sorta like a function block diagram
20:28:30 <Dot> i dont tihnk so
20:29:18 <Dot> they client sends a URS that states what they want it to do, and the processes involved, a list of all the intruments, drives and valves
20:29:51 <Dot> then we put it all in a document with the wording now lining up with what the code will do 
20:31:38 <skram> So its not a logic schematic but just a document that says what buttons do?
20:31:42 <Dot> "If the Washwater Break Tank Level Trasnmitter (LT76903) is High the Assist Motor (M54001) will be requested to start"
20:31:50 <Dot> stuff liek that
20:32:23 <Dot> but you might include that the High level is a operator adjustable set poin (CW_HIGHSRTLVL)
20:32:50 <Dot> the things in brackkets are the actual tags that will be used in the code
20:35:00 <Dot> so its not amazingly intresting
20:35:00 <skram> so its like a logic schematic sorta but with words
20:35:39 <Dot> its the process step by step put into words, so kinda
20:35:40 <skram> well you have to use your brains which is sorta neat
20:36:36 <Dot> then there is a fault section where you say if X (like a motor failing)happens, Y will happen (an alarm is sent to the SCADA and the duty is cycled)
20:37:13 <Dot> then you list everytihng involved
20:37:32 <skram> what sort of tag is LT76903 though
20:37:41 <skram> how many dang level transmitters does this stupid thing have
20:37:41 <Dot> Level Transmitter
20:37:53 <Dot> and then numbers are decided by the client
20:38:11 <Dot> it SEEMS to be to deperate areas and also very random
20:39:35 <skram> You should tell them to use KKS
20:40:29 <Dot> is that a norwegion thing?
20:40:51 <skram> Its what power stations use to tag components
20:41:18 <skram> its an actual system
20:42:53 <Zounds> A standard skram?
20:42:59 <Zounds> that is too useful a thing to have
20:43:39 <skram> its a bit like cheating

20:48:45 <Dot> latest*
20:49:22 <Dot> skram https://imgur.com/gallery/j9d1Lwo
20:49:42 <Camail> yea, it's  kinda amazing
20:49:55 <Camail> lul Runbunny  ikr
20:50:12 <Runbunny> I was so close.
20:50:15 <Camail> i dont know how people can fuckin play these games if all of g rank is like that
20:50:35 <Camail> i guess you get people who are all decent
20:50:54 <Runbunny> But I suggested that we lured the guy of his lair. That place is ass. 
20:51:03 <Runbunny> But 2 guys just didn't.
20:51:36 <Camail> i've never had issues in the lair
20:51:46 <Camail> save your temporal mantle for that part
20:52:11 <Camail> but really you just avoid the middle lava geysers right, that's the only stage hazard
20:53:06 <Camail> i actually top DPSd my latest teostra kill, by like 100 damage, but still :P
20:53:23 <Camail> i almos tknow at tesotra as well as i know some ds3 boss fights
20:54:14 <Runbunny> I just cycle between temporal and fireproof mantle.
20:54:33 <Runbunny> The only thing I really cart on now is when there is bullshit.
20:55:04 <Runbunny> Like if he attacks me and I block and he then goes into super nova there is nothing I can do.
20:55:35 <Runbunny> Can't block super nova, can't dodge with weapon out and it takes too long to sheathe and dodge.
20:55:41 <Camail> i think you can block the nova
20:55:45 <Camail> you cant?
20:55:49 <Camail> i swear i saw someone do it
20:56:00 <Runbunny> well I have died every time I tried.
20:56:06 <Runbunny> Only tried once tho.
20:56:17 <Camail> you need guard up
20:56:24 <Runbunny> and I think I was wearing the fireproof mantle as well.
20:56:49 <Runbunny> Well there you go.
20:57:00 <Camail> you might have a deco
20:57:18 <Runbunny> I think I do.
20:57:39 <Camail> i would guess its almost required for gunlance
20:58:35 <Camail> i put earplugs in for teostra and i am honestly not sure if its worth it
20:58:54 <Camail> its nice not dying to a hit,roar,hit combo tho
21:01:03 <Runbunny> Yeah, that's a bit of bullshit a well.
21:01:39 <Camail> but yea, it takes awhile but you are able to read animations eventually
21:01:52 <Camail> the biggest thing i learned is that when he jumps away, he always jumps back soon
21:01:58 <Camail> so dont chase
21:02:44 <Camail> also IG users who have a blast knisect are assholes
21:02:57 <Camail> 1. it does no damage 2. healing is way better
21:03:23 <Camail> peak performance and not having to run to heal increase your dps way more than a fucking 12 damage blast
21:03:52 <Camail> and the blast bugs look exactly like teostra's blast auras
21:06:07 <Runbunny> :D
21:06:12 <Runbunny> I don't have the decoration
21:06:24 <Runbunny> Need to farm that I guess.
21:06:40 <Runbunny> It has a pretty low drop chance but then again you only need 1.
21:07:27 <Camail> or just switch out a piece of armor
21:07:39 <Runbunny> ?
21:07:42 <Camail> or use the charm, more likely
21:07:51 <Camail> something else has to have guard up
21:07:52 <Runbunny> Still haven't done that quest.
21:07:55 <Runbunny> Yeah
21:08:03 <Runbunny> It's a 3 piece set armor.
21:08:26 <Runbunny> or the charm, which requires the white winds of whatever quest.

21:40:54 <Dot> where you been
21:41:08 <Cane> Hai Dub. =)
21:41:28 <Cane> Dot, what hero did you play? Pango?
21:41:38 <Runbunny> I got one just now
21:41:45 <Runbunny> Made the charm and all.
21:41:47 <Dot> windrunner
21:42:38 <Cane> I wish she was meta, she's fun,.
21:42:48 <Cane> She doesn't show up much in tournaments right now.
21:42:54 <Dot> she isnt meta? silly
21:44:39 <Cane> I've been trying to find high level games with Night Stalker and it's actually impossible.
21:44:53 <Cane> He's so un-meta right now that if you search for live games where he's played, you get like four.
21:45:52 <Dubtop> I been school, dot!
21:46:25 <Dubtop> Mon and Wed are awful schedules -- an 8am class, a 12:30 class, and then 5pm class... -.-;
21:46:37 <Zounds> fuck that
21:46:38 <Dubtop> Lots of hours sitting around on campus.
21:46:55 <Dubtop> I just read a book :P
21:47:09 <skram> is it a book about BUTTS
21:48:06 <Camail> books are for nerds, dub
21:50:47 <Dot> he is a silly hero cane
21:51:12 <Dubtop> All u need is bointy and lina

21:55:41 <Cane> You mean Invoker and Broodmother obviously.
21:55:53 <Cane> Also it took me a second to realize what you meant about bointy.
21:56:02 <Camail> dub go play dota on ur laptop
21:56:02 <Cane> I've half a mind to call him that now.
21:56:18 <Camail> who called him bointy first
21:56:23 <Camail> was it bloodynoob?
21:56:31 <Camail> its one of the dota gang
21:56:39 <Cane> So he's just Bointy now.
22:02:01 <Dubtop> Ye bloody
22:02:10 <reification> he steals your monies now D:
22:02:10 <Dubtop> "Was it worth it bointy?"
22:02:31 <Dubtop> Spidermom is also the good, you're not wrong.
22:03:25 <reification> cane has impeccable taste in dota heroes
22:03:38 <Cane> What other heroes are awesome reif?
22:04:35 <Cane> I've been playing Phoenix and Io too. And I want to be good at Rubick because spell steal is so fun.
22:04:56 <reification> rubick io 
22:05:13 <Cane> So basically we're just on the same page forever.
22:05:34 <Zounds> What's your opinion on my boy Lion
22:05:43 <Dubtop> A lesser Lina
22:06:08 <reification> does lina ult get better the more you kill with it tho?
22:06:17 <Cane> Lion is like the 2nd most popular hero right now, it's ridiculous.
22:06:35 <Zounds> Lina can't mana drain people into hating themselves and everything dub
22:06:42 <Dubtop> Lina does pewpewpew
22:06:43 <Zounds> pluss less cc
22:06:47 <Dubtop> From 10 miles away
22:06:54 <Cane> Lina with refresher orb is a bit silly.
22:07:10 <Cane> And then you right click someone and her attack is a gatling gun, it's great.
22:08:24 <Zounds> I was a bit partial to Magnus when I played
22:08:46 <Zounds> reverse polarity was all the rage back then
22:09:07 <reification> magnus is super powerful now
22:09:18 <Cane> It's his Empower that's broken at the moment.
22:09:34 <Zounds> Looks like i played dota2 a few years too early
22:09:35 <Cane> Giving Cleave to a carry AT WILL is some insane shit.
22:09:39 <Zounds> I was just ahead of my time I guess
22:09:53 <Cane> He's often banned and often picked.
22:10:10 <Cane> I looked up old "metas" by looking up TI pick rates.
22:10:19 <Cane> Apparently 2012 was the year of Invoker, if ever there was one.
22:10:32 <Zounds> He's a real pubstomper
22:12:01 <Zounds> yeah the magnus cleave and the draw-in of shockwave was not a thing when I played magnus
22:12:15 <Zounds> empower was just more damage
22:12:27 <Cane> Oh was it?
22:12:30 <Cane> Yeah, he gives Cleave now.
22:12:48 <reification> free battle fury good ability

22:37:00 <Rawr|Phone> Dub don't be a snitch
22:38:10 <reification> Legendary Gambler Tetsuya is another option but it's far more about *cheating* at mahjong
22:38:18 <Runbunny> oh boy.
22:38:29 <Runbunny> Zounds, is watching saki?
22:38:46 <Runbunny> Say hello to the taco loli from me.
