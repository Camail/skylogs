00:31:47 <Bio> silly birbs
00:54:48 <Camail> i keep trying to get into dmc5 but i just cant stand the controls
00:55:06 <Camail> character action conventions are just...not my thing
00:55:30 <Runbunny> Switch to the live action cutscenes.
00:58:56 <Camail> it feels like most of the game revolves around you being stylish, but i'm kinda getting bored of the movesets. I like interesting enemies more than interesting characters
01:00:45 <Camail> and everyone seems to think this is like, the best character action game
01:13:33 <Runbunny> As far as I know the game is fairly easy unless you play on "Dante must die".
01:13:45 <Runbunny> How far are you in the game?

17:50:46 <Camail> so the csgo economy is kinda broken as fuck now
17:51:09 <Camail> the in-game one, not the skins one
17:51:52 <Runbunny> It's an interesting change.
17:52:02 <DuBtop> O, so
17:52:07 <carcinization> https://twitter.com/hinazoumomo/status/1105773018247094273
17:52:09 <DuBtop> Eh, will chat in sec dot heading home now
17:54:36 <Camail> i like the thought
17:55:21 <Camail> because money resetting would actually ruin an even match up
17:55:52 <Camail> if both teams are evenly matched it favors whoever happened to get the win streak
17:57:43 <Camail> it's such a big change we just need to see how it plays out, but i am skeptical
18:00:57 <Camail> i'd prefer if they just got rid of the 1400 bonus
18:01:11 <Camail> remove double ecos from the game, cool
18:01:58 <Camail> but money fucking was an important part of csgo, if your round win was a fluke from a single persons performance then you should be punished if you can't keep that going
18:02:46 <Camail> and it also makes comebacks less likely from disparities like 4-14
18:03:40 <Camail> get up to 9-14, go 9-15, money fuck to 10-15 and get to overtime

21:57:07 <skram> because bio couldnt control his fuckin' pizza hunger
21:57:35 <Camail> so selfish
21:58:36 <Camail> i feel like there are three versions of me: the one you guys see, the one everyone else sees, and the one rimworld sees
21:58:54 <skram> i dont think i want to see rimworld cam??
21:59:01 <Camail> because my current conundrum is that i cant harvest all of my prisoners' organs because then their labor isn't as effective
22:02:40 <Zounds> An organ here or there wont go amiss
22:03:21 <skram> i feel like keeping them inside your pals for more effective labor is a better long term strategy
22:03:37 <Camail> but they sell for a decent amount
22:04:17 <Camail> i haven't done THAT many terrible things in all my other playthroughs
22:04:18 <Zounds> Harvest visitors organs
22:04:41 <Camail> see, that makes trading difficult
22:05:03 <Zounds> idk harvest the merchant and he might be willing to pay a tidy sum for his lungs back
22:05:25 <Zounds> not much of a long term strategy though I'll admit
22:05:49 <Camail> if you take both lungs they die
22:05:59 <Zounds> take his tounge so he can't warn the others
22:06:14 <Camail> which gives normal colonists the "prisoner organ-murdered" debuff which is super bad
22:06:33 <Camail> luckily that wont be an issue this game

22:16:23 <Bio> harvesting organs is a valid strategy
22:18:43 <Camail> yea, in my latest normal colony i had harvesting days
22:19:09 <Dot> sounds like a fun celecration
22:19:22 <Camail> because the debuff can only stack 5 times, so if you have 5 prisoners you can stack like 20 surgeries in 2 days and be really efficient about it
22:19:35 <Dot> Dorf fort has organ doning. Goblins donate organs to the ground
22:20:33 <Dot> mermaids use to donate large amount of head gones to the cause

22:47:02 <Runbunny> I have never used bttv. I block all my ads using ublock origin.
22:47:18 <Runbunny> What does bttv change? I thought it was just extra emotes.
22:47:44 <Runbunny> That is practical Reif.

22:49:38 <Bio> bttv has a bunch of options
22:50:53 <Camail> they block the twitch notifications, stream extensions, streamer suggestions on the bottom left
22:51:40 <Camail> they can change eastern language usernames to their original ones
22:51:43 <Runbunny> I don't even see those. I placed objects in front of my screen.
22:52:29 <Camail> it adds zebra stripes to chat
22:52:47 <Camail> lets you force theater mode when opening a stream, that one's nice
22:52:54 <Camail> dont have to click that every time
22:54:00 <Camail> tons and tons of little things, it also allows you to prevent messages from being deleted, or to purge <message deleted> from chat
23:04:48 <DoT|Phone> what happened to bttv though?
