10:19:02 <Cane> Winning, but they're on the other team so it's hard to gauge.
10:20:27 <CockRoach|42> https://imgur.com/gallery/cX2qHvE
10:33:15 <Cane> HAHAHAHAHA HOLY SHIT
10:33:32 <Cane> Well I'm getting a 2070.
10:39:41 <Golly> how many arms/legs did it cost
10:41:55 <Cane> My three year old 980 Ti died and that's the replacement they're sending me. I'll take it.
10:42:15 <Cane> I was expecting like a 1070 or something.
10:42:27 <Golly> nice
10:42:38 <Golly> ive been sitting on this 970 gtx for a while
10:42:56 <Golly> rough market these days
10:43:09 <Cane> My friend still has a 760. Rough times.
10:44:32 <DoT|Phone> I went from a 9600.. I think it was, to the  970 I have when it broke. and the 970 was yolteotls extra with a dodgy fan
10:44:42 <DoT|Phone> free card is free though
10:45:11 <Cane> Oh hell yeah, I remember you getting the upgrade back in the day.
10:45:15 <Cane> That was great stuff.
10:45:27 <Cane> Operation "Get DoT A PC So He Can Play With TLP."

10:50:51 <DoT|Phone> How's your sleep schedule doing cane? maybe dies l dota this evening if your awake
10:51:12 <Cane> I'll be gone tonight, unless we play in the afternoon some time.
10:51:16 <Cane> Got shit to dooooo.
10:51:53 <DoT|Phone> I finish work about 4:30 English time
10:52:02 <DoT|Phone> so probably not home in time
10:53:21 <Cane> We might get a few games in, we'll see. <3
10:53:27 <Cane> I'll need to try out Visage a bit.
10:54:19 <DoT|Phone> he looks fun
11:01:53 <Cane> I wish he was still support I guess. Most people play him as safe carry/core now because his familiars are so freaking good late game. Get Solar Crest and melt someone's armor, Grave Chill them to slow them down, and Familiars are just SO FAST that everything melts.
11:02:16 <Cane> He's like a core that doesn't need tons of items.
11:02:46 <DoT|Phone> so offlanish then?
11:03:06 <DoT|Phone> everything is offlane to me
11:03:27 <DoT|Phone> besides hard carrys
11:26:45 <Cane> It's odd. He's mostly position 1 right now, sort of hard carry until level 10-15 where he starts doing super well in team fights.
11:26:57 <Cane> And then weird shit happens and lanes change.
11:27:07 <Cane> So I guess at the top level you have to know how to play around that.
