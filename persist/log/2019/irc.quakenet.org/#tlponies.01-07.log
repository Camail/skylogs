00:25:40 <skram> looks tasty
00:25:47 <skram> probably costs a million dollars
00:25:56 <Cane> I'll ask for that one when they realize my GTX 980 Ti is dead and they don't have one in stock and they need to send me an equivalent replacement.
00:26:06 <Cane> I'm sure it's roughly in the ballpark of my busted 980.

22:22:44 <DoT|Phone1> what a Monday!
22:25:52 <Zounds> I read that ana short story
22:26:05 <Zounds> I guess getting a bit more insight into characters is nice
22:26:19 <Zounds> still spinning our wheels in the same place as ever though
22:26:31 <Zounds> I think Overwatch is just never gonna advance in story
22:27:19 -!- BioPhone [~androirc@mobile-107-92-123-115.mycingular.net] has joined #tlponies
22:28:02 <Zounds> Wasn't much insight gleaned either to be honest x_x
22:36:45 <Camail> i honestly dont think they have story writers on staff for overwatch
22:37:15 <Camail> like, character writers sure, but i doubt they are even attempting to write something long form
22:37:38 <Camail> writing has never been blizzards strength, so it doesnt bother me
22:37:41 <Crisium> OW story has no future
22:37:46 <Crisium> its all past 
22:38:03 <Crisium> only new plot since the launch of the game was doomfist escaping
22:38:16 <Camail> the best they will ever do is team fortress style stuff
22:38:49 <Crisium> i think they should just lower the budget and do in game engine stories more frequently, like the junkertown animation
22:39:06 <Crisium> instead of 2 movie quality level shorts a year
22:39:25 <Camail> thats what makes blizzard...blizzard
22:39:26 <Crisium> but look, this was just a short story and its the first plot in months
22:39:31 <Crisium> so its not budget
22:39:32 <Camail> they do animatics
22:40:08 <Crisium> this was the biggest plot reveal in years if you ask social media tho
22:40:16 <Crisium> because soldier
22:40:17 <Camail> they'd be more satisfying if they had more story content, and now just character features
22:40:26 <Camail> not*
22:40:56 <Camail> but the fact of the matter is that a story doesn't mesh with the gameplay
22:41:26 <Crisium> what do you mean. OW, Talon, and Junkers teaming up to fight a mirror match doesnt mesh with story?
22:41:45 <Camail> thats what they tried to figure out for like a decade
22:42:04 <Zounds> I don't really care if it matches gameplay
22:42:12 <Zounds> Just an ongoing story in the background would suit me
22:42:26 <Zounds> Like they one they started then stalled for a couple of years
22:43:00 <Camail> they aren't gonna make an overwatch extended universe
22:43:49 <Zounds> Too bad really
22:43:54 <Zounds> No reaper redemption arc ever
22:44:06 <Crisium> Warcraft has 2 genres, StarCraft almost had 2.  theres a chance
22:46:46 <Zounds> I do wonder what the heck Micheal Chu does at work all day
22:47:40 <DuB`> Haha
22:48:02 <Zounds> I'm not kidding
22:48:07 <Zounds> What is a day in the work life of Micheal Chu
22:48:12 <Crisium> yeah it is weird that he is a full time employee and makes story elements ~5 times a year
22:48:24 <Crisium> 2 CGI shorts, and like 3 comics/ stories a year
22:48:29 <Crisium> thats his life
22:48:35 <Crisium> well and voicelines
22:48:44 <Crisium> writing voiceline interactions in the spawn room must be a hard life
22:49:03 <Crisium> 'Lucio's dad works for Symmetra's evil company"
22:49:06 <Crisium> nice job Chu
22:49:10 <Crisium> was that a weeks work?
22:49:17 <Zounds> Useless twat tbh
22:51:38 <Crisium> the sad thing is the voicelines have had more plot reveals lately than anything else
22:52:12 <Crisium> and budget wise are virtually free
22:52:28 <Crisium> for the writing staff anyway, i guess you gotta get the VAs again
22:52:49 <Crisium> but its like 3-4 sentences total per interaction
22:53:57 <Zounds> I'm suspicious that the entire point in that short was to reveal S76 as gay
22:54:05 <Zounds> And if that's the case...wut?
22:54:37 <Crisium> new ana skin maybe
22:54:50 <Crisium> or prague as a future uprising style event
22:54:57 <Zounds> Ana just entirely handwaves why she didn't reveal herself to Pharah
22:55:10 <Zounds> Why the heck would her daughter be expecting "captain amari" and not her mother
22:55:25 <Zounds> Your daughter would just be happy to see you either way no
22:55:32 <Bio> neigh
22:55:45 <Crisium> but despite being one of the most inclusive shooters ever, the "sjws" (yes i used it, get over it) got on Blizzard hard for Ashe not being black so they wanted to throw a bone
22:56:04 <Crisium> im saying that in the most apolitical way i can, i truly mean the woke people gave blizzard a hard time for Ashe being white.
22:56:22 <Zounds> That's a battle you can't win I think
22:56:45 <Crisium> but i dont think that was the point of it
22:56:49 <Crisium> thats just all social media focuses on lol
22:57:59 <Crisium> the Ana in the twitter post has to be a skin
22:58:07 <Crisium> https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1082351191072202753
22:58:28 <Zounds> Yeah there's a render of it in the short story
22:59:04 <Zounds> https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/rk/RK25WEUAJIPO1546649730105.pdf scroll to the bottom
22:59:17 <Crisium> oh ya there ya go
23:02:34 <Zounds> But yeah there is a side to overwatch fanbase especially on twitter that loves overwatch for its inclusivity and apparent progressiveness most of all
23:02:35 -!- BioPhone [~androirc@mobile-107-92-123-115.mycingular.net] has joined #tlponies
23:02:49 <Zounds> And there's those who just want a fun video game
23:02:58 <Zounds> and some who are both probably =P
23:03:15 <Crisium> i like both.  i think its more fun that way, but some ppl are militant
23:03:41 <Crisium> like china is 1/5 of the world, and has 1 character out of 29.  they should be raising hell but I dont think they care lol
23:04:03 <Crisium> give Mei a husbando!
23:04:14 <Zounds> A diverse team just makes sense in overwatch universe so I'm not really bothered much
23:04:20 <Bio> I am an attack helicopter, there are no apache chars. FUK U BLIZRD
23:04:34 <Zounds> Crisium: I will be her husbando!
23:04:40 <Crisium> hero 30: Zounds
23:04:48 <Zounds> \o/
23:04:53 <Bio> a perfect 5/7 char
23:04:56 <Bio> would main
23:05:01 <DuB`> :D
23:05:56 -!- skram [~skram@82.147.53.123] has joined #tlponies
23:06:05 <Bio> oho
23:06:07 <Bio> a wild skrm
23:06:45 <Zounds> I wonder if we'll ever get a Scottish hero
23:07:00 <Camail> Runbunny people are really bad at tempered kushala
23:07:07 <skram> well we have you, zounds
23:08:17 <Zounds> We've already got an English one that might count as close enough for blizz
23:08:38 <Crisium> they're both British... technically
23:08:59 <Crisium> so you have Great Briain and Irelend repped
23:09:08 <Zounds> Yeh
23:09:35 <Zounds> Maybe a Norwegian then
23:09:56 <skram> theres already 2 swedes
23:10:05 <Crisium> yeah sweden is basically everything north of Germany to americans
23:10:55 <Bio> how many vikings does a game need smh
23:11:27 <Zounds> One of those swedes is torb though
23:11:36 <Zounds> joke character that should be removed
23:11:41 <Crisium> sweden is 0.13% of the world and has 2/29 characters.  pls remove brig
23:11:45 <Crisium> pls remove brig
23:11:45 <Zounds> or at least made to not literally be a warcraft dwarf
23:11:48 <Crisium> pls remove brig
23:12:47 <Zounds> Then who would I switch to when I'm playing badly
23:12:49 <Zounds> brig must stay
23:12:55 <skram> torb is next best hero
23:13:15 <skram> brig is basically freyja come to midgard
23:13:34 <Zounds> The most over represented location is the Moon though
23:14:15 <Zounds> Or the USA since they have 3
23:18:02 <Crisium> usa has 4 thank you very much
23:18:10 <Crisium> reaper, soldier, ashe, mccree
23:18:38 <skram> is reaper american though
23:18:51 <Crisium> Gabriel Reyes is
23:18:52 <skram> well i guess he was in the army so probably
23:18:58 <Crisium> yeah hes a Soldier too
23:19:14 <Zounds> skram: born in los angeles
23:19:25 <Crisium> but per nation's population Sweden is the most over repped
23:19:38 <skram> if its in america why is the name spanish
23:19:43 <skram> amerika exprain
23:19:57 <Crisium> cause like 15% of the country speaks spanish
23:20:09 <Zounds> It was founded by a spaniard
23:20:19 <Crisium> we did conquer half a mexico once
23:21:42 <DoT|Phone1> Skram
23:21:59 <skram> aye lad
23:22:19 <DoT|Phone1> I'm failing to sleep again
23:22:47 <skram> go to bed, bud
23:25:39 <DoT|Phone1> I did. over an hour ago
23:25:46 <Zounds> TIL scotland has a higher population that Norway
23:25:49 <Zounds> than*
23:25:52 <Zounds> not by much but slightly
23:27:56 <Zounds> Significantly more people live in London itself than in Scotland overall
23:27:58 <Zounds> what a hellscape
23:28:32 <Runbunny> Camail I am not surprised.
23:29:18 <skram> Zounds, Glasgow is a pretty big city too yeah?
23:29:55 <Zounds> Compared to london it's nothing
23:30:43 <skram> ya i suppose
23:30:44 <Zounds> 600,000 vs 8.136 Million according to google
23:31:04 <skram> thats about the same size as oslo
23:32:28 <Zounds> Our countries are quite comparable when it comes to cities and stuff like that
23:32:37 <Zounds> As long as we stay away from happiness and quality of life discussions
23:35:02 <skram> the secret is antidepressants
23:36:29 <Crisium> https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/overwatch-ptr-patch-notes-january-7-2019/281458
23:37:18 <Crisium> reaper finally OPAF
23:37:27 <Crisium> brig, dva, armor nerfs
23:38:11 <Zounds> 50% lifesteal wow
23:38:23 <Crisium> and nerfed armor too
23:38:43 <skram> finally your favorite boy is relevant zounds
23:38:49 <Crisium> OPAF
23:38:58 <Zounds> I was gonna say the 50% doesn't help when you do no damage to armor and die anyway
23:39:06 <Zounds> but yeah the armor change ontop of the lifesteal
23:39:19 <DuB`> OAAAAAA armor nerf oooo
23:40:04 <DuB`> They're trying hard to kill GOATS before OWL s2 starts :P
23:40:20 <Zounds> If this doesn't help best boy Reyes I don't know what will
23:40:23 <DuB`> And they'd better, goats v goats for an entire stage of owl would kill it outright
23:40:48 <skram> GOATS is the best thing since tank meta
23:41:34 <skram> Friggin 9 minute team fights is infinitely better than nanoganja 5ks
23:41:45 <Crisium> theres no doubt reaper can fight goats now
23:42:41 <Crisium> this is the OWL patch most likely
23:42:44 <Crisium> since its next month
23:45:20 <Zounds> So what do we think instead of GOATS
23:45:28 <Zounds> Double sniper?
23:45:57 <Zounds> It shall be interesting to find out
23:46:10 <Crisium> it'll just be dive
23:46:21 <Crisium> dive includes widow on some maps
23:46:52 <Crisium> alternatively you can run 3 tank, 2 support + widow still
23:46:55 <Crisium> since widow can OHKO reaper
23:46:57 <DuB`> Unless dmatrix and rally limit nerfs aren't enough to kill goats :P
23:47:45 <skram> dmatrix is sorta minor but the armor nerf is big
23:47:49 <Crisium> theorycrafting Rein (Winston on some maps), Zarya, Dva, Ana, Zen, Widow
23:47:50 <skram> rally too
23:47:53 <Zounds> yeah
23:48:03 <Crisium> goats with Widow instead of Brig
23:48:25 <Crisium> maybe not Zen+Ana, its unorthadox
23:48:29 <Crisium> but basically 3:2:1
23:48:43 <Crisium> Lucio more likely
23:59:55 <Camail> carcinization they put modding into StP
