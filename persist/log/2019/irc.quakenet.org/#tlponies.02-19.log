19:41:23 <skrm> Good to see your fae
19:41:26 <skrm> face
19:42:51 <Dot> fae too
19:46:55 <Rawr|Fone> I ebjoy seeing your face here too skrammypants
19:47:03 <Rawr|Fone> Enjoy
19:48:28 <Camail> never trust the fae
19:48:46 <Dot> they are so friendly though
19:50:00 <Camail> they are, for awhile
19:50:30 <Camail> so dot is the IRA chomping at the bit to start the troubles again?
19:50:43 <Camail> because no deal brexit is scarily close
19:51:41 <Dot> i havnt heard anything about them, but they are always an unhappy bunch
19:52:16 <Camail> you should find another country to move to, maybe third times the charm
19:52:27 <Camail> canada is mostly fine
19:52:39 <Camail> other than the economy and the corruption scandal
19:52:47 <Rawr|Fone> You can live with me dot
19:52:56 <Camail> DONT TRUST THE FAE
19:54:30 <reification> i doubt the ira is gonna seriously start up again after they managed such a perfectly timed exit from terrorism into politics
19:55:13 <Runbunny> No one wants border control points.
19:55:15 <Dot> just look at rawr cam, the fae is great
19:55:59 <Camail> lets just hope the policy can actually be enacted
19:56:15 <Camail> i'm more worried for the uk than the us, at this point
19:57:10 <Dot> i saw Mr Berny is going to run again in the US
19:57:35 <Dot> Bernie*
19:58:09 <Camail> yea, 2 years is a long time, normal americans ignore the race until like 6 months out
19:58:11 <reification> this time he doesn't get a free ride as not hillary
20:03:13 <Zounds> I cringe at the mention of the IRA
20:03:20 <reification> labour being the party to fracture over europe is kinda funny though. it's 1981 all over again
20:03:36 <Zounds> Spend too much time at celtic football club with scotsmen LARPing as Irishmen
20:03:44 <Golly> checkpoints in ireland again is a no no
20:04:50 <reification> it's basically a lot of brinksmanship
20:04:59 <Runbunny> but that will have to happen on the border of ireland and northen ireland no?
20:05:09 <reification> but such misjudgements are how the whole brexit thing happened
20:05:10 <Runbunny> in case of brexit
20:05:59 <Camail> only for a no deal brexit
20:06:51 <Camail> they have the opportunity to set up a transition timeline, thats what the theresa may deal was
20:07:09 <Camail> but that was shot down harder than literally anything ever
20:07:59 <Camail> most of the options they have end in political suicide so everyone is frozen in fear
20:09:42 <reification> no actual option has majority support in parliament and anyone with *any* foresight immediately fled power as soon as the vote results were in
20:17:55 <Runbunny> Just do the no brexit option and take the suicide.

20:56:14 <Dot`> hows you two
20:58:23 <Phearlock> Quite alright
20:58:37 <Phearlock> I bought way too much cola today but it was on sale
20:58:47 <Phearlock> I won't drink it all in one go
20:59:51 <Dot`> quiter talk
21:00:46 <Phearlock> Yeah I think something will quit if I drink 9 liters of cola in one go.
21:00:59 <Phearlock> Heart, liver, bladder, not in that order
21:01:39 <skrm> well you never know unless you try
21:02:49 <Camail> DuBtop  i always pictured you as a bottom
21:04:24 <Zounds> No man who collects scarves at any point in their lives is a top
21:05:00 <skrm> how do you know zounds
21:05:18 <Camail> arnold schwarzenegger has scarves
21:05:33 <Camail> are you saying he's lived his life as a power bottom?
21:05:44 <Zounds> Not even a power bottom
21:05:48 <Camail> wow
21:06:04 <Zounds> In the bedroom is when he can finally relax and give up the facade
21:06:12 <Camail> but he's too bulky
21:06:17 <Camail> its like trying to move a sofa
21:06:33 <Camail> it takes at least two other people to get anything done
21:07:23 <Zounds> lol cam
21:07:30 <Zounds> almost spilt my drink there, moving a sofa
21:07:34 <Zounds> funny shit
21:07:38 <Camail> ty ty
21:07:46 <Camail> its the only fitting analogy
21:12:55 <Runbunny> You guys know that feeling when you're incredibly bored but you don't want to do anything either?
21:13:21 <Dot`> life?
21:14:00 <Phearlock> Yeah I know that feeling runbunny
21:14:41 <Camail> Runbunny  want to fill the void with apex?
21:15:03 <Runbunny> No thanks :/
21:15:03 <Dot`> wow cam
21:15:14 <Runbunny> Think I'll go for a walk.
21:15:17 <skrm> Think im gonna go home soon and fill it with whiskey instead

22:28:17 <DoT|Phone2> am I being a bigger dick than normal recently? I don't know, I've been on and off depressed for months and I guess New job is stressful. I thought I was holding it together rather well apart from a few instances. but I feel it from ppl that I'm just wearing them all down.
22:29:06 <Zounds> Haven't noticed dot
22:32:50 <Zounds> most of the euros in this chat are grumpy butts so a little more edge would fly under the radar
22:33:14 <Zounds> haven't worn me down at all at least :P
22:33:39 <carcinization> ^
22:35:26 <Crisium> iv never seen dot being a dick
22:38:07 <Camail> yea, there hasn't even been a real fight in here in years
22:38:49 <Camail> no dicks here
22:38:57 <Zounds> I love recettear Camail 
22:38:59 <Zounds> jkjkjk
22:39:12 <Camail> many people love garbage
22:39:23 <Camail> anime exists, after all
22:39:50 <Zounds> Pute a cute girl and sexy fairy in a game and drooling retads like me will line up its true
22:40:49 <Camail> meh, if anyone feels i have bad blood with them then it isn't true
22:40:55 <Camail> i just ignore people who i dont like

22:41:19 <Camail> runbun pls
22:41:30 <Camail> feeling better?
22:41:58 <Runbunny> oh I am fine. Just feeling mellow. 
22:42:07 <Runbunny> Upcoming funeral and all.
22:42:22 <Camail> ah, shit. yea. it hurts
22:43:01 <Camail> just had my grandmas first birthday in 65 years without grandpa. it's rough
22:43:14 <Phearlock> =(
22:43:30 <Runbunny> :/
22:43:36 <Camail> these are the things we deal with
22:43:39 <Camail> unending march of time
22:44:22 <DoT|Phone2> I don't know, I sit and I think that ppl I grew up with are the kind that hurl meaningless abuse at each other all the time, theirs was usually strings of swearing, my replies where acidic sarcasm, and I just worry if I'm not careful it'll just be dickish all the time too ppl.
22:44:53 <DoT|Phone2> but really nothing in dealing with even comes close to loss of a family member
22:45:11 <Camail> well i can only speak for myself, and me and you are good
22:45:27 <Camail> i've learned to be more compassionate the last 2 years or so
22:45:40 <Camail> it's helped with my relationships quite a bit
22:45:56 <DoT|Phone2> almost lost my last grandmother a month ago, the close call was terrifying enough
22:46:40 <Camail> pain is incomparable, i've never found solace in knowing my pain is lesser or greater than others
22:46:50 <Camail> and i've never truly understood that method
22:47:16 <Camail> being stressed about yourself is just as valid, it's all pain
22:50:16 <DoT|Phone2> well I'm glad I haven't managed to offend anyone here. it helps a lot
22:50:27 <Camail> yup yup <3
22:50:29 <Zounds> gonna hit the hay pons
