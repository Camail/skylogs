12:27:26 <Runbunny> why is this marked as sensitive material?
12:29:49 <carcinization> the bot marks everything like that so it doesn't get in trouble with twitter
12:34:21 <Runbunny> Oh.
12:34:54 <Runbunny> Just usually there is straight up porn behind those "sensitive material" prompts.
12:39:03 <Runbunny> DoT|Phone, https://i.imgur.com/wIJHIp2.mp4
12:39:13 <Runbunny> To brighten your day.
12:39:52 <carcinization> a surprise, but a welcome one
13:17:58 <DoT|Phone> it's a good gif
13:54:55 <Runbunny> I really like ESA a lot more than GDQ. It's a lot more relaxed and runners seems to have more fun with the runs.
13:56:17 <DoT|Phone> gdq use to be very relaxed and fun
13:56:41 <DoT|Phone> it's still good but I think they feel a lot more responsibility and expectation now
13:57:45 <skram> guess you gotta be sorta serious when you pull millions of dollars in a week
13:58:11 <skram> i do think its anti-fun reputation is mostly undeserved though
13:59:12 <DoT|Phone> I think it's a lot of ppl recalling select parts from early gdq's
13:59:27 <DoT|Phone> as is normal for ppl
14:41:17 <Cane> There definitely was a period of transition with AGDQ that was really bad.
14:41:35 <Cane> The year after they got really big, they felt like they needed to read out every donation, and all of them were about people dying horribly of cancer.
14:41:44 <Cane> So the mood was just completely shot, and I couldn't watch it.
14:41:55 <Cane> They immediately rectified that the next year, and ever since they've been getting better.
14:42:08 <Cane> I think the latest AGDQ was one of their best ever, even though it's definitely changed from how it used to be.
14:42:36 <Cane> And from what I've read, even people critical of AGDQ's push towards being more serious, "more about money than speedrunning" etc, really liked this year's incarnation.
14:43:32 <Cane> I think they've found a good balance finally.

19:54:49 <Camail> it feels like doing things with my left hand
19:55:27 <Dot> yea, apex seems to require reguluar playing to keep in the right feel for it
19:55:29 <Dot> for me at least
