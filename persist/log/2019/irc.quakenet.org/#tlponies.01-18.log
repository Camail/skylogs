00:34:14 <Camail> might try other weapons, will probably just do the new content as it comes out
00:34:25 <Camail> and then wait for more people to get the game
00:34:53 <Camail> then run through it  with low rank weapons like runbun did with me
00:37:19 <Camail> its definitely a game i'd get for other people, once i have money

16:23:38 <Fleischy> have you guys gotten over your fetishes yet and become proper human beings
16:24:10 <Cane> You seem so bitter.
16:24:12 <Cane> Are you ok in life?
16:24:20 <Fleischy> no but lets face it who is
16:24:29 <Cane> You could be.
16:24:50 <Cane> It's just odd to me that your life is so miserable that you need to ridicule other people for a bit just to feel a tiny bit better.
16:24:53 <Cane> That's no way to exist.
16:25:13 <Cane> You really do deserve better than that.
16:25:41 <Fleischy> it hardly changes anything for me so you could say ridiculing other people is just a way of life at this point
16:26:04 <Fleischy> in any case I dont see any familiar faces from the ancient days so I guess some people actually did get over their fetishes and move on
16:26:18 <Cane> Well, for what it's worth, I'm sorry if your life is crappy. That shouldn't be happening.
16:26:20 <Fleischy> also the size of the channel is about a third of what it once was
16:27:01 <Fleischy> it's just a phase after all
16:27:07 <Cane> You'll be alright man.
16:27:13 <Fleischy> you know back in my day I was into star wars a lot
16:27:19 <Fleischy> but it was just a phase mom
16:27:34 <Fleischy> also gen is probably dead but I guess nobody from this crowd remembers him 
16:27:51 <Cane> That sucks if it's true.
16:27:56 <Fleischy> I'm sure wikt remembers wherever he is
16:28:07 <Fleischy> that old scrooge
16:28:12 <Fleischy> used to ban us on sight

16:29:29 <Fleischy> anyway give wikt a good slap from me when you see him
16:29:31 <Cane> People change. Not saying he did, but some times people realize wait, what the hell am I doing.
16:29:36 <Cane> Wasn't he a kid?
16:29:50 <Cane> lol sure. Bye Fleischy.

16:37:44 <DoT|Phone1> also cane, thoughts on force staff over blink dagger in support. more utility for loss of better instant move which can be stopped if hit
16:38:28 <DoT|Phone1> and easier to get force staff
16:40:15 <Golly> depends a bit on if you can initiate fights i would think
16:40:47 <Cane> Yeah I'm with Golly. It depends on if you initiate. Blinking into position and hitting a solid spell combo vs using it strictly as an escape tool, or to get team mates out of trouble.
16:42:08 <Cane> So if you're backline support Force Staff gets you out of trouble.
16:42:14 <Cane> If you're an initiator, Blink Dagger all the way.
16:43:00 <Cane> On the flip side, at our level Blink Dagger lets you reposition better.
16:43:12 <Cane> Since we're not good at positioning in combat ahead of time yet.
16:43:23 <Cane> And Blink Dagger is a good "shit I should be over here right now" ability.
16:43:30 <Cane> So I almost always just go Blink.

22:06:50 <Zounds> just remember to tornado units your team has set up for kills
22:07:13 <Zounds> also spending your time trying to snipe kills with sun strike is the best thing you can do
22:07:19 <Zounds> ice wall and cold snap are bad don;t use them
