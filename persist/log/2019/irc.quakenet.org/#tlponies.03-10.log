19:19:45 <DuB`> In 2019!
19:20:09 <Zounds> nice
19:20:15 <Zounds> I've been kinda wanting to play a bit lately
19:20:49 <Crisium> Bio i am in discord
19:28:16 <DuB`> OW should be especially nice when current PTR goes live
19:28:55 <DuB`> Only thing I worry about is lucio being perhaps marginally less speedyfun
19:29:02 <DuB`> Not sure how that change is gonna actually work
19:42:13 <Zounds> you should pit your friend stacks against each other
19:42:15 <Zounds> see which is the strongest
19:42:32 <DuB`> Oh I already know that :P
19:42:49 <Zounds> How do the ponies measure up
19:42:54 <Zounds> Or are we too variable within the stack

19:43:35 <DuB`> One is a a bunch that just started this year and is all < lv40, the other have a couple hundred hours and are all gold-plat
19:43:55 <DuB`> So... bronze v gold
19:45:17 <Zounds> Must be kinda fun playing with the newbies though
19:45:25 <Zounds> You are a God to them
19:45:47 <DuB`> It's been fun, I just lucio or something most games
19:46:07 <Zounds> Implying Lucio isn't a murdering monster who wins every 1v1 in lower skill matches
19:46:41 <DuB`> ;D
19:51:17 <Crisium> yeah slow lucio on ptr sucks
19:55:11 <Runbunny> Did the change the game so that I would find it enjoyable or is it still a ult fest? 
19:59:18 <Zounds> I think it's that way by design Runbunny
