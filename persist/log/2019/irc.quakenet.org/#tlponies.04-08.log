20:18:23 <Camail> are they just powering through it?
20:18:38 <Camail> if i could ignore bleed that'd be great
20:20:01 <Runbunny> I think there's a few ways to get immune to bleeding.
20:20:26 <Runbunny> Check the pantheon, it might help as well.
20:20:35 <Camail> yea, i am looking at the wiki and i really dont think they have those
20:20:44 <Camail> one was a trickster, the other an elementalist
20:22:38 <Camail> oh, it can be a corrupted jewel implicit 
20:33:18 <Camail> yea i think that's the big difference
20:35:29 <Camail> gonna buy one of those
