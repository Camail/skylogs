03:24:57 <Camail> the Chonk major
03:25:09 <Camail> relevant meme material
03:25:21 <Camail> who is the chonkiest team
03:26:09 <DuB`> All I know is that I rage a little inside when a team is drafting all brown/orange/red heroes and then lastpick a blue/green hero or vice-versa...
03:26:13 <DuB`> The WORST
03:31:13 <Camail> its an accent hero
03:31:31 <Camail> lrn2pallet 
03:32:01 <DuB`> At least pick it 3rd so it's in the middle and symmetrical
03:34:15 <Camail> true
03:34:44 <Camail> this asymmetric fashion trend is too try hard
03:58:25 <Camail> liquid isn't that chonky
03:58:46 <Cane> Welp.
03:58:54 <Cane> Liquid just doesn't make any plays.
03:58:59 <Cane> They just play lanes and get ganked.
04:13:10 <skrm> damn did liquid get 2-0'd?
04:13:20 <DuB`> ye
04:13:27 <skrm> too many legs
04:17:04 <DuB`> Need Miracle :(
04:17:38 <DuB`> ... or at least a standin who understands english 
04:17:49 <skrm> language is overrated
04:18:18 <DuB`> All languages except english are overrated
04:19:22 <skrm> You spent like 9 years of your life learning japanese??
04:19:34 <skrm> Are you telling me you wasted your life, dub?
04:23:01 <DuB`> TWO years!
04:26:44 <Camail> other languages ARE garbage tho
04:29:58 <skrm> Hva faen er det du sier til meg, din jÃ¦vla fitte? Jeg vil at du skal vite at jeg at jeg er den beste ulvjegern pÃ¥ jaktlaget og har vÃ¦rt med pÃ¥ utallige tjuvjakter og har over 300 ulvepelser i vedboden
