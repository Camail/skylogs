08:14:33 <skram> good morning
08:15:02 <DoT|Phone1> how you
08:16:20 <skram> well enough
08:16:47 <skram> had to go to the tire shop after work and spend like 500¬£ 
08:17:27 <DoT|Phone1> that's many monies
08:17:41 <skram> cars are dumb and cost too many money
08:18:17 <skram> But driving on almost bald tires is both dangerous and illegal
08:18:49 <DoT|Phone1> very consensus of you
08:18:59 <DoT|Phone1> that's probably not how you spell that
08:19:10 <skram> entirely selfish i promise
08:19:20 <skram> i dont want to die and i dont want to lose my driving license
08:19:55 <DoT|Phone1> hmm.
08:20:32 <skram> but wait theres more
08:20:59 <skram> had to book an appointment at a garage to replace the timing belt because if you dont your engine will explode
08:21:11 <skram> god i love spending my hard earned skrilla on CAR THINGS
08:21:14 <skram> >_>

08:32:11 <DoT|Phone1> this weekend I may have to start pulling together notes for Waterdeep: Dragon heist

08:34:35 <DoT|Phone1> there's like over 50000 dragons. way more than bios campaign
08:35:04 <skram> hmmm
08:35:07 <skram> that might be too much dragon
08:35:15 <DoT|Phone1> heresy
08:53:13 <Camail> skram you should play as a dragon
08:54:07 <skram> dont be gross
08:57:44 <DoT|Phone1> Skram only plays as himself, a grumpy dorf
09:02:23 <DoT|Phone1> Skram, which is the dumbest visual, a loxadon or centuar monk

09:39:33 <Camail> runbun you are on a diet?
09:40:27 <Runbunny> Nope.
09:40:43 <Camail> ah, why the calorie counting, then
09:41:23 <Runbunny> But my brother was involved with a diet thing, and the institute that was testing it out, had a bunch left over. So it's basically free food.
09:41:49 <Runbunny> Like I just replace a meal once in a while with a shake or something.

16:27:49 <skram> ooooh n0tail
16:29:53 <skram> oh cane i went to some vw shop to get my car done and they had a porsche 917 rear clip in the gulf oil livery standing in the lobby
16:30:02 <skram> because the owner of the shop is building a replica
16:30:17 <Cane> skram, dude that's awesome!
16:30:44 <Cane> Did you become best friends?
16:32:20 <skram> I wish
16:32:24 <Bio> liquid krubick
16:32:54 <skram> The guy that owns it is like a somewhat well known vintage VW builder person
16:35:27 <Cane> I booted up the game to watch in-game the second I saw Liquid Rubick.
16:35:40 <Cane> Loooona
16:35:54 <Bio> if its kuro rubick
16:35:57 <skram> kuro rubick!
16:36:01 <Bio> its a good dude to pick up tips from
16:36:14 <skram> is this 2013
16:36:16 <Bio> his positioning is almost always perf
16:37:00 <Cane> People keep saying Kuro is the weak link on Liquid, game wise. I don't know enough about it to comment though.
16:37:12 <Bio> eh
16:37:17 <skram> hmm
16:37:23 <Bio> he's captain, so he's always playing the whole map
16:38:00 <Cane> Yeah that's the thing, I feel like maybe the people who are saying that are disregarding how important he is as shot-caller and captain with his map awareness.
16:38:07 <Cane> Because he's not "flashy" he's not as good as other supports.
16:38:12 <Cane> But yeah I dunno.
16:38:14 <Cane> I'm new.
16:38:30 <Bio> yeh
16:38:32 <skram> he just a lil 5th pos support
16:38:52 <Bio> i'd much rather be the "weak link" on one of the best teams in the game, than the best on a crappy team imo
16:39:02 <Cane> For sure.
16:39:09 <Cane> And I mean this is his team.
16:39:20 <skram> i mean they did win ti7
16:39:45 <Bio> and only didn't win last year because something something china year
16:39:47 <Cane> Kuro was removed from Secret because "you'll never amount to anything and we need to shake things up", so he literally made his own team with blackjack and hookers and Liquid was all "want to play for us?" and then they won TI. True story.
16:40:06 <skram> though kuro did write a whole thing about how he is kinda unmotivated because he did the thing he wanted to do
16:41:31 <Bio> kuro pls
16:41:35 <Bio> become win 2 ti
16:41:44 <skram> yas

22:15:04 <DuB`> Pasta something!
22:15:24 <DuB`> Or at least something warm for a cold winter evening.
22:15:57 <skrma> eat a fish, cane
22:16:01 <skrma> it is good for you
22:16:39 <Cane> I don't think I'm actually Norwegian skrma, I don't like seafood much.
22:17:06 <skrma> cane you live in the place where fish comes from??
22:17:36 <Cane> Yeah but we sell it to you idiots because it's gross and dumb.
22:17:41 <DuB`> Haha
22:17:47 <DuB`> No SOOSHI?
22:18:05 <Cane> I don't mind fish patties though, depending on ingredients.
22:18:13 <skrma> what about salmon
22:18:19 <DuB`> I hated all seafood until I had good sushi...
22:18:20 <Cane> Hmm, DuB` sold me on warm and comfy pasta today, it's really freaking cold in Norway.
22:18:20 <skrma> its the only fish i like
22:18:31 <DuB`> :D
22:18:40 <Cane> Smoked salmon is amazing on sandwiches, and very average as a dinner food. It's just kinda dry.
