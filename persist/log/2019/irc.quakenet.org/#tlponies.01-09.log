16:01:38 <Camail> Runbunny i installed a dps meter for mhw, but it takes like 10 fps off, which is weird
16:01:51 <Camail> but you can run it at the end of a hunt
16:13:39 <Runbunny> I don't want to know how bad I am doing :P
16:32:22 <reification> lol
16:35:42 <Camail> i want to, so i can change how i play
16:35:59 <Camail> if staying alive is my only metric then i cant improve
16:52:27 <Runbunny> I know my most optimal combo. So all there is left is movement and positioning.
16:53:10 <Runbunny> Also finally got the gunlance that I wanted.
16:53:35 <Runbunny> Only took like 20 Katie kills.

17:02:00 <Camail> optimal combo is like the easiest thing to learn, the other 90% is more complicated
17:02:46 <Camail> unless you play ranged
17:02:59 <Camail> then its just time invested and shot sequences

18:03:55 <Camail> we should try codenames with a strict 1 word rule, even if you want to say a name

18:13:27 <Camail> its legit great
18:13:38 <skram> yeh we've not played it enough
18:13:40 <Camail> you could play on your phone too
18:13:50 <Camail> skram is addicted tot he rush of people guessing his logic
18:14:10 <Camail> which is a lot of the appeal for both sides
18:14:11 <skram> its the only joy i feel
18:16:32 <Camail> skram Dot  Runbunny should we play now?
18:16:49 <Runbunny> What are we playing?
18:17:01 <Camail> codenames
18:17:02 <skram> sure
18:17:16 <Runbunny> Oh. nah. I am not game atm.
18:19:16 <skram> u rude
18:24:08 <BioPhone> I prolly shouldn't play at work
18:25:02 <Camail> lul
18:25:06 <skram> you probably should
18:25:07 <Dot> lies, you play board games at work bio
18:25:08 <Camail> it would be pretty obvious
18:25:15 <Dot> i was making food
18:25:22 <Dot> its soup from a tin
18:25:29 <Dot> im a gourmet chef
18:25:39 <Camail> we could play co-op with skram as spymaster
18:25:48 <Camail> when bio gets home we can teach him
18:26:11 <Dot> nah, im havnt slept well past 2 nights, really sleepy
18:26:21 <Camail> try drugs
18:26:36 <Camail> skram see, now you feel my pain
18:26:41 <skram> eat actual food
18:27:16 <Runbunny> Try dropping a brick on your head.
18:27:20 <Runbunny> Instant sleep.
18:27:57 <Dot> come cook for me skram, i really cant care enough about food to do it
18:29:05 <skram> just buy 9 pounds of bacon and 39 eggs
18:41:33 <Camail> easy stuff can taste good and be healthy
18:41:54 <Camail> like, making a good sandwich is so damn easy
18:43:21 <Runbunny> Lick on grass to fill your stomach and guts with specific bacteria that release enzymes that can break down cellulose and just eat grass.

18:50:45 <Phearlock> Btw dub Nexelerin update is out for starsector, if you want to do the whole conquering planets instead of just blowing them up.
18:50:57 <DuB`> Oooh
18:50:58 <Phearlock> Also factions invading each other
18:51:07 <DuB`> Was waiting on that one
18:51:08 <Phearlock>  #mod_updates channel on the discord
18:51:12 <DuB`> Yeah
18:52:09 <Phearlock> Had a great moment where I'd founded my first 2 colonies (in the same system so better fleet defense) but got invaded by a massive hegemony fleet before I had star fotresses up.
18:52:39 <Phearlock> So was stuck with small patrol fleets, 2 battlestations and my own 1 capital ship and a few cruisers versus about 20 hegemony attack fleets.
18:53:03 <DuB`> Uh oh
18:53:35 <Phearlock> I managed as they didn't all attack at once so had a chance to use my nearby colony to repair CR between each set of like 2-4 fleets.
18:53:44 <Dot> Hey phear, dub <3
18:54:00 <Phearlock> Still, lost several cruisers and my capital was blown up once (recovered thankfully)
18:54:12 <Phearlock> And my battlestations were basically ruined
18:54:17 <Phearlock> But hey, fought them off.
18:54:19 <Phearlock> Good times
18:54:40 <Dot> i think you underestimate how little i care for food cam
18:54:58 <Camail> its kinda important
18:55:08 <Dot> yea and a pain
