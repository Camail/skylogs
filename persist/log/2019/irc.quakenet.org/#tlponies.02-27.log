01:47:34 <Bio> hej
01:47:38 <Bio> my internets return
01:56:09 <DuB`> :D
01:56:30 <Camail> gj
01:58:02 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/evo
02:10:33 <Bio> yeah cam
02:10:37 <Bio> but whens mahvel
02:28:37 <Camail> hmmm, i know there are a lot of shitty people on both sides that are gonna take the lack of melee as a slight
02:28:49 <Camail> i hope it's less than i expect
02:30:35 <Camail> but it is weird
02:30:43 <Bio> yeh, it helps that ultimate is pretty well regarded
02:30:51 <Camail> i'd have like it in, having two smash games would be fine
02:30:55 <Bio> by most people
02:31:20 <Bio> but yeah, melee is so classic
02:32:16 <Camail> it's tough, because melee fans have a different perspective than the fgc
02:32:44 <Camail> objectively, it's still a strong community and there's no reason to take it out? i dunno
02:33:12 <Bio> yeah idk why take it out either
02:33:19 <Camail> but also, evo cycles out games regularly
02:33:46 <Camail> it's just what they do, and when a new game comes out people typically leave behind the old game
02:34:17 <Camail> but for the melee community it is the ONE game
02:34:45 <Bio> yarp
02:34:49 <Camail>  the only reason marvel died is because a new game came out and it sucked
02:36:31 <Bio> the gem one?
02:36:47 <Camail> stones, but yea
02:36:55 <Camail> the gem one is a different marvel game
02:37:02 <Camail> 2, actually
02:37:13 <Bio> mm
02:37:30 <Bio> the infinity gauntlet stuff right
02:37:46 <Camail> yup
02:38:35 <Camail> its cool that uniest gets a spot
02:39:05 <Camail> sam sho is a weird choice
02:39:19 <Camail> but the devs 100% paid for it, so that's whatever
02:39:37 <Camail> prepiering games dont actually take up a spot because thats not an empty spot, they made it with money
02:40:05 <Bio> screw the rules i have money
02:40:14 <Camail> and i have no opinion on blazblue, i'd prefer mele
02:40:33 <Camail> no, it's not an exception thing, it's literally just hiring more staff that wouldn't be there
02:41:21 <Camail> the only spots that are actually in flux are blazblue and uniest
02:41:37 <Camail> uniest earned their spot, easily
02:42:04 <Camail> BB then, is the only free spot and i have never even watched it so i cant say anything
02:43:01 <Camail> part of it must also be that nintendo fucking HATES melee
02:43:14 <Camail> they want it to die so badly
02:44:44 <Bio> could be
02:45:01 <Camail> i mean, they tried to ban it at evo 2 years ago
02:45:15 <Camail> so yes, we know their preferences
02:45:37 <Camail> or whenever smash4 premiered

21:09:02 <skrm> are you calling zounds a witch
21:10:32 <Camail> i am
21:10:39 <Zounds> We liked to call people witches here back in the day
21:11:06 <Zounds> even men sometimes
21:11:30 <Camail> those are warlocks, now
21:12:00 <Camail> we got rid of that class because it was unbalanced
21:12:10 <Camail> we couldn't use the excuse that they were women as a reason to kill them
21:13:43 <skrm> whats the difference between a wizard and a witch
21:14:05 <Camail> witches do black magic
21:14:20 <Camail> curses, hexes, etc.
21:15:06 <Camail> poisons too
21:16:35 <skrm> i found the facts https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-differences-between-a-wizard-and-a-witch
21:18:03 <Camail> by a professional witch
21:18:43 <Camail> no better expert than someone who thinks witch is a substantive term

23:02:16 <Runbunny> Ofc you want that Jonas.
23:02:32 <Runbunny> I'll also accept "not the danes" as a valid answer.
23:03:07 <skram> I like Astralis though
23:03:13 <skram> or those other guys
23:03:22 <Runbunny> But they're danes!
23:03:39 <Runbunny> You have been hanging out with Benny too much.
23:03:50 <skram> Anders is this some weird BDSM thing?
23:04:48 <Runbunny> Not at all. Camail was being all "Everyone are enemies" and stuff, so I figured he'd need a friend in these dark times.
23:04:59 <skram> oh
23:05:01 <skram> he's fine
23:05:02 <Runbunny> Who better than you Jonas?
23:05:10 <skram> like so many
23:05:23 <Runbunny> Name one.
23:05:36 <skram> yer mum
23:06:31 <Camail> skram smells like feet
23:06:34 <Camail> can i have someone else
23:07:00 <Runbunny> Don't put your feet on him then!
23:07:11 <Camail> but he yells at me if i don't
23:09:27 <Runbunny> That can't be helped.
23:09:39 <skram> dont blame your foot fetish on me, pal
