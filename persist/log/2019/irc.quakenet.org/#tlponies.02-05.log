18:20:32 <Dot> you ready?
18:22:43 <Cane> https://www.twitch.tv/dreamleague Team Liquid vs Team Secret! Let's goooo.
18:22:55 <carcinization> that makes it sound like dub is playing in the game dot
18:23:09 <Dot> he may be
18:23:41 <Cane> I just tested out Bloodseeker. Dude's fun when your team snowballs a team fight.
18:24:16 <Dot> ri pliquid, they picked a 2 headed hero
18:24:38 <Cane> It's cool, they'll pick Ogre Magi and be up to 2 extra heads, that'll cancel it out.
18:24:43 <carcinization> he goes so fast cane
18:25:32 <Cane> Zooooom.
18:25:43 <Cane> How to win against Bloodseeker: Be healthy.
18:27:49 <Dot> HORSES
18:27:55 <carcinization> horse strat :O
18:28:05 <Dot> so many legs
18:28:20 <Cane> Team legs vs team heads.
18:28:23 <carcinization> oh no luna ban
18:29:22 <Dot> ruined
18:29:24 <carcinization> lifestealer infest lets everyone have multiple heads!
18:29:39 <skram> whoa
18:29:48 <skram> is this gonna be a puppey chen game
18:29:53 <skram> what a blast from the fuckin' past
18:30:33 <carcinization> wait isn't naix supposed to be garbage tier now?
18:32:08 <Cane> Not any more. 7.21 reverted the boot changes, and he got +15 movement speed.
18:32:10 <Cane> Dude's insane now.
18:32:19 <Cane> +5*
18:32:20 <Cane> not 15
18:32:23 <Cane> 15 was Bloodseeker.
18:32:45 <Cane> Wait no, it is +15, I was right.
18:32:55 <Cane> I should stop second guessing myself and just realize I'm awesome.
18:32:57 <Cane> And he got +2 armor.
18:33:05 <Cane> So yeah, big buff.
18:33:13 <Cane> Uh oh, Ursa.
18:33:17 <Cane> And now I'm worried.
18:33:20 <Cane> Ursa is huge now.
18:33:28 <Dot> Bears are great
18:34:32 <reification> ursa stomps tide?
18:34:45 <skram> ursa stomps anyone that has to get in melee range
18:34:47 <skram> :P
18:34:50 <Cane> ^ Basically.
18:35:12 <Cane> Ursa also got +15 movement speed in 7.21
18:35:32 <Cane> He basically just runs down your supports and you can't escape.
18:35:54 <skram> you can deal with ursa with laser
18:36:27 <skram> so basically team liquid needs to control engagements, but if they do they should be able to win
18:36:45 <skram> between laser, ravage, and ice path
18:37:12 <Cane> Liquid can definitely do it, but Secret has been looking really good lately.
18:37:14 <Cane> Should be a good game.
18:37:28 <skram> counter attack with ursa/pa is pretty devestating
18:38:59 <Cane> Omg OD.
18:41:28 <Cane> And there's Ursa.
18:41:37 <Dot> roar roar roar
18:42:05 <Rawr|Phone> Dot snela
18:42:18 <Dot> :P
18:43:57 <Dot> well then
18:43:59 <Cane> Liquid getting rekt.
18:44:06 <Cane> Getting nippy in here.
18:44:09 <skram> lil bit
18:48:30 <Cane> Heh that's Ursa.
18:48:33 <Cane> Free Rosh.
18:54:03 <Dot> A KILL
18:58:13 <Cane> Yeah, the second they got Ursa I got worried.
18:58:17 <Cane> New Ursa is terrifying.
18:58:22 <Cane> Has like a 60% win rate across all ranks atm.
19:03:11 <Cane> This went from nippy to kind some time ago, and I fear we'll have langur soon.
19:11:51 <Cane> I'm calling the next game a win for Liquid. Somehow.
19:12:12 <Dot> optimism, i like it
19:13:06 <Dot> and at this point,. liquid loses and we are all sad or they win and you tell us you called it
19:13:07 <Dot> :P

21:10:06 <Camail> bunny girls are the new hotness
21:10:18 <Camail> and by new hotness i mean the old hotness that everyone desperately wants
21:10:38 <Dot> i thought it was racoon girls now?
21:10:44 <Camail> proof that FFTA is the best final fantasy game
21:10:53 <Camail> racoon girls are for plebians
21:11:00 <Camail> simple folk
21:11:01 <Runbunny> O:
21:11:05 <Runbunny> How dare you ?!?
21:11:13 <Camail> put her in the trash
21:11:25 <Runbunny> Put you in the trash.
21:11:35 <Zounds> I've always liked bunny girls
21:11:40 <Zounds> in almost all forms
21:11:40 <Camail> put YOU in the other trash
21:11:47 <Runbunny> You probably like Myne, Camail.
21:11:58 <Runbunny> You're probably one of those.
21:11:58 <Camail> viera's are fantastic snipers
21:12:27 <Camail> i dont know who that is
21:12:48 <Camail> google is telling me about akame ga kill, but that show sucked so it couldn't be
21:14:21 <Zounds> I never played FFTA but FFXIV kind of made me want to now
21:14:33 <Zounds> the alliance raids were based upon it this expansion
21:16:33 <Camail> the only people who dont like it are the people who thought it would be a sequel to FFT
21:17:08 <Cane> Bointy is pretty fun. He feels so, so much stronger than Riki.
21:17:19 <Zounds> oh it's a different game I thought it was just a weird abbreviation of FF Tactics
21:17:27 <Zounds> Well I'd be happy to try either
21:17:30 <Camail> totally different
21:17:37 <Camail> its a GBA game

21:17:43 <Runbunny> Literally the worst.
21:17:49 <Camail> better than ur trash, probably
21:19:01 <Camail> te racoon girl doesn't even look like a racoon in any way

23:12:43 <Micen> boo. 
23:15:34 <Camail> so auto chess looks fun
23:15:45 <Camail> but downloading dota is too much work
23:20:04 <BioPhone> There's something about it cam
23:20:33 <DuB`> A whole button click or two!
23:20:40 <Camail> its a deck building game, really
23:21:22 <Camail> DuB` i'm accounting for the future scenario of being 2 less clicks away from actually playing dota
23:21:34 <Camail> which is just too much of a risk for both body and mind
23:22:03 <DuB`> Heheh
