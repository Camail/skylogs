16:06:23 <reification> "my horse can't even walk 6 foot without toppling"
16:07:14 <Zounds> nice Runbunny 
16:07:31 <Zounds> maybe they were 3 grouped and could not comm each other
16:07:41 <Zounds> or maybe you did a good job
16:08:37 <Zounds> I was playing split screen CoD:MW2 with my bro like ye olde days
16:11:38 <Zounds> BioPhone: tanks are better dps than your typical dps players if my experiences are anything to go by
16:12:30 <Zounds> FFXIV has shite players of any role in droves though so I don't discriminate
16:15:05 <Runbunny> O:
16:15:20 <Runbunny> I had a horrible tank a few days ago.
16:15:43 <Runbunny> or rather my black mage cat ass was tanking all the mobs except for 1.
16:18:47 <Zounds> yes
16:19:00 <Zounds> I don't even know how somebody is bad at tanking in ffxiv but it happens
16:19:19 <Zounds> turns out pressing your aoe threat ability every so often isn't easy
16:20:03 <Zounds> being a strong tank is all about dishing out as much dps as you can the actual threat holding is pretty easy
16:20:24 <Runbunny> Well It does some like Gladiator has a bit worse AoE than Marauder/Edgelord.
16:21:02 <Zounds> flash is kinda comparable to unleash for DRK
16:21:12 <Zounds> overpower is ez threat forever as warrior though

23:43:51 <Runbunny> 2.8 hp is very low.
23:46:22 <Camail> yea, for like, the big end game stuff
23:46:34 <Camail> but i do have mind over matter so my effective hp is higher
23:47:20 <Runbunny> How much mana do you reserve?
23:48:35 <Camail> like98%, but i have EB and 1k shield
23:48:59 <Camail> i have like 15% res in fire and lightning
23:49:05 <Camail> that's my biggest thing
