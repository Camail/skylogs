10:00:54 <DuB`> Hehe
10:01:13 <DuB`> Evil for the GREATER GOOD and because the good guys also are jerks

14:13:09 <Cane> DoT|Phone1, make something new STALKER related come out so I can justify installing it again.
14:13:16 <Cane> Call of Chernobyl is still on the same version. =(
14:14:33 <DoT|Phone1> when I was looking a few months back ppl seemed to be focusing on 2 other mods that had come out
14:15:42 <DoT|Phone1> when I say focusing, I mean most of the posts on reddit where error fixing
14:16:30 <Cane> I want to live in a world where STALKER is easy to mod and has tons of people doing it, Skyrim style.
14:16:47 <Cane> Even Mount & Blade has infinity overhaul mods because it's easy to do a full conversion.
14:17:00 <DoT|Phone1> skyrim stalker mod gogo

20:48:14 <Zounds> is it because there's parts of it that are kinda red

22:16:09 <Zounds> how come you're getting free food BioPone 
22:21:07 <Camail> Dot`  i was thinking that if we want to warm up in apex we should do some quick dives for a few rounds
22:21:22 <Camail> warming up is important if we're gonna stake a 10 minute loot session on the very first fight
22:22:40 <Dot`> always been te biggest part of battle royals, is getitng good at the game can be really frustrating when you loot for 20 minutes, die in your first fight
22:22:45 <Dot`> repeat
22:22:55 <Dot`> sometimes dont see people till final 4 and die first fight
22:23:09 <Dot`> becuase you are not gettign the feel for the gunplay
22:23:29 <Dot`> i feel part of what makes apex populour is the quick action
22:23:59 <Camail> yea, and we can make it even quicker
22:24:28 <Camail> it also makes you figure out certain strategy of quickly finding loot, and if you dont, running to your big brother who got a gun
22:24:40 <Camail> and punching is a legit strat in a 2v1
22:24:43 <Dot`> we should follow a group land near them, with a few houses to loot between us
22:24:56 <Camail> yup
22:25:10 <Camail> on top of getting better, it just helps you lossen up and warm up
