09:38:23 <DoT|Phone1> wtf
09:38:31 <Camail> my house is fucking making noises

09:43:45 <DoT|Phone1> your just a bit south of Chicago right? somewhere around there
10:38:41 <Cane> GPU arrived, yeeee.
10:39:10 <DoT|Phone1> another one?
10:39:22 <DoT|Phone1> didn't you get one like last year?
10:46:40 <DoT|Phone1> you try dead cells yet cane?
10:49:12 <Cane> No, my old one *died* last year,.
10:49:29 <DoT|Phone1> oh, ouch
10:49:42 <DoT|Phone1> what you do to the poor things?
10:50:12 <Cane> My GTX 980 Ti was under warranty so I sent it back to the retailer. They were like "yup, is busted", and since nobody stocks 980 Tis any more, they're sending me an RTX 2070.
10:50:14 <Cane> Which is a SLIGHT upgrade.
10:50:20 <Cane> So yeah. I get to pick that up later today.
10:51:53 <DoT|Phone1> I'm sure you will humbly accept this trying situation of dealing with a different gpu.

11:26:26 <Runbunny> And what does armour do Dot?
11:26:32 <Runbunny> It protects you!

12:55:14 <Kittybunny> .tell Camail I played around with the Hunting horn a bit more. Apparently you can link everything into a hilt stab, and one of your attacks can add another note if your timing is good. 4 notes melodies deals a lot of damage if you play them from neutral.
12:56:47 <DoT|Phone> sounds complex
12:58:13 <Kittybunny> It's actually not too bad.
12:58:47 <Kittybunny> Rather fun. and you get to smack monsters in the face with your giant mace.
