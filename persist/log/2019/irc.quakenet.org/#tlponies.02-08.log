08:45:56 <DoT|Phone> well yea cam, it was sad he stopped, but apparently the anxiety had gotten really bad leading up to shows, plus the time it took from his work
08:47:03 <DoT|Phone> hey skrm
08:47:09 <Camail> i heard that they plan on ramping up aq inc stuff and he didn't really want to do that, and the traveling was already too much
08:47:18 <Camail> doing a game at every pax was fine when there were 2 pax
08:47:27 <skrm> sup dot
08:47:30 <Camail> but now there are 4

09:02:22 <Camail> that spot is in frequent rotation, the only true constants are omin and jim
09:02:28 <Camail> viari is there most times
09:02:36 <Camail> and the 4th spot changes almost every event
09:03:12 <DoT|Phone> Will see how look long Patrick survives without Perkins
09:03:14 <DoT|Phone> Haha
09:03:36 <Camail> jeremy has already let him get away with some things just to fuck with jerry
09:04:13 <Camail> it's more theater than dnd at this point, it's a very loose game
09:04:52 <Camail> the scale is like, DCA is all the way into real dnd land, CR is in the middle, and aq inc A and C are really far to the right
09:05:08 <Camail> some times they aren't even dnd
09:05:23 <Camail> well i guess adventure zone is the farthest right
09:05:34 <Camail> to the point where they abandoned the game altogether
09:06:36 <Camail> so yea, dont think anyone's dying any time soon

20:40:49 <Runbunny> tried a KT siege with the insect glaive. Other weapons are so yolo compared to gunlance/hunting horn.
20:41:25 <Camail> blocking is for cowards
20:41:30 <Camail> just be good
20:41:32 <Camail> forever
20:41:36 <Runbunny> O:
20:41:45 <Runbunny> How do you even block with a hunting horn O:
20:42:04 <Camail> by running away and playing music
20:42:22 <Runbunny> That's not what you do.
20:42:42 <Runbunny> Playing melodies is like your hardest hitting attacks.
20:42:49 <Camail> RUN AWAY
20:43:21 <Camail> i've been playing a bunch of water bow, consistently doing like 40% damage on lavasioth
20:43:37 <Camail> but its still faster in a group for me because i dont have tow orry about that dumb OHKO move
20:43:56 <Camail> that boy took my 17 minutes to kill first time with LS, was rough
20:44:04 <Runbunny> There's a OHKO move?
20:44:13 <Camail> the charged up fireball
20:45:14 <Camail> its pretty easy to dodge but i'm trying to get my damage in and my animations are so fancy and big sometimes

21:12:29 <Runbunny> Ample opportunities for failing.
21:12:58 <Camail> it looks fine
21:13:34 <Camail> i dont think anything is terribly complex, they're just complex enough to be fun
