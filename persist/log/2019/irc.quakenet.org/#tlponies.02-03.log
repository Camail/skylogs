19:47:45 <Micen> there it is!
19:47:55 <DuB`> Aha
19:48:01 <Dot> i knew we had one somewhere
19:48:03 <Dot> haha
19:48:10 <Cane> Wait, what's the saltlist? I don't remember that lol
19:48:15 <DuB`> It doesn't even have Cris on it!
19:48:20 <reification> i here
19:48:22 <Micen> it was people who got OW beta keys back when
19:48:29 <Cane> AHA right!
19:49:55 <Runbunny> Did I have a beta key?
19:50:06 <Runbunny> I think I only bought it on release.
19:51:58 <Micen> maybe it was those that didnrt
19:52:01 <reification> it's ppl who didn't bun
19:52:05 <reification> hence the salt
19:55:12 <Camail> it was the people who didnt have thme and wanted them
19:55:20 <Camail> i dont think many people in here got them
19:55:23 <Camail> or anyone
19:56:39 <Runbunny> oh
19:56:40 <Camail> i wonder if salty as a term would even exist in mainstream without twitch emotes
19:57:10 <Camail> it's lost some of the nuance, which is a shame
19:57:47 <Micen> salt predates twitch, doesnt it? originated on /v/ i think 
20:19:12 <Camail> i'm not talking about the origin ( which isn't 4chan)
20:19:27 <Camail> talking about its mainstream breakthrough
20:37:27 <Dot> skram
20:54:23 <Zounds> I first heard salty from salty bets
20:55:34 <Zounds> well except from salty seamen but I think that's a bit different
20:57:17 <Zounds> that's more like experienced than angry/irritated
21:13:01 <Camail> salty at this point just means mad because of a failure
21:13:37 <Camail> but the BEST version of salty is the fgc version, which is the act of shitting on the skills of the person who just beat you
21:14:22 <Camail> its the definition of going down with the ship, willing to call yourself trash just so you can call the other person trash
21:14:29 <Dot> sad cus bad
