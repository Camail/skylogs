00:09:10 <Camail> it is time for dot to sleep
00:10:45 <Dot`> no sleep, only regret
00:12:11 <Camail> why not both
00:12:20 <Camail> dream of regret
00:13:15 <Dot`> the regret is in not sleeping though
00:14:16 <Camail> yea, so you can get the self-hate and the self-love in your dreams
00:14:27 <Camail> so whichever one is good for your mental health, you have it covered
00:18:22 <Dot`> hmm

18:37:50 <Zounds> don't get shot, friend
18:38:09 <Dot> gl!
18:38:52 <Camail> it's surpisingly easy to not get shot
18:38:57 <Camail> i've been doing it for years
18:39:31 <Dot> overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer
18:40:52 <Runbunny> Hai Zounds.
18:40:56 <Runbunny> Welcome back Camail.
18:41:08 <Zounds> IF some
18:41:23 <Zounds> If somebody* is rolling down their window as they drive past then dive out of the way
18:41:46 <Camail> just down go farther south than china town
18:41:54 <Camail> and dont use the red line
18:42:00 <Camail> thats all you gotta do
18:42:21 <Runbunny> .tell reification https://i.imgur.com/Gau7cG9.jpg
18:42:39 <Runbunny> Isn't it America? If someone shoots at you, you just shoot back?!?
18:42:45 <Zounds> I suppose the triads are more interested in chopping up other chinamen than random folk
18:42:52 <Zounds> at least that's what they do here
18:44:53 <Runbunny> You have triads?
18:45:17 <Zounds> yes
18:45:24 <Zounds> Not in very great numbers at all but they exist
18:46:19 <Zounds> Mostly harmless unless you're into people smuggling or unauthorised gambling
18:50:50 <Runbunny> As in they do that or they are after people who do that?
18:51:08 <Camail> rip n0thing
18:51:28 <Camail> both, runbun
18:51:33 <Zounds> yes both
18:51:35 <Camail> criminals are self policing
18:53:07 <Runbunny> I see.
18:53:37 <Runbunny> So if you don't trafick people according to standards they get really mad.
18:54:14 <Camail> as in, if you do it at all
18:54:21 <Camail> competition is frowned upon, i'd guess
18:54:53 <Camail> organized crime is essentially just a completely free market, right
18:55:01 <Runbunny> I don't have knowledge about organized crime at all.
18:55:17 <Dot> sure runbun
18:55:29 <Camail> well, no law seems to be the case
18:55:29 <Dot> apart from your blood smuggling
18:55:33 <Camail> ^
18:55:43 <Camail> you are a diseased vampire
18:56:02 <Camail> who only steals sickly blood
18:56:03 <Runbunny> I don't smuggle that.
18:56:27 <Camail> it's legal smuggling
18:56:43 <Camail> "the illegal movement of goods into or out of a country."
18:56:54 <Camail> so clearly legal smuggling is just moving
18:57:03 <Runbunny> goods are already inside the country.
18:57:14 <Camail> you are part of the shipment chain tho
18:57:36 <Runbunny> I just take it out of people and stick it in the freezer.
18:57:51 <Runbunny> Also
18:58:00 <Runbunny> There's a thing I want to build.
18:58:16 <Camail> ...a blood thing?
18:58:19 <Runbunny> However it's illegal in all parts of the world except for Florida.
18:58:25 <Runbunny> wait
18:58:33 <Runbunny> The other florida...
18:58:39 <Runbunny> California.
18:58:45 <Camail> oh boy
18:58:52 <Camail> good thing we dont have anyone from cali in here
18:58:54 <Camail> they would not be happy
18:59:00 <Camail> with that comparison
18:59:22 <Runbunny> But the people from florida would be exstatic. So it balances out.
19:00:27 <Camail> what do you want to build
19:00:31 <Camail> a weed farm
19:00:35 <Runbunny> a stem cell line.
19:00:50 <Camail> oh, china likes that too, right
19:01:07 <Runbunny> Maybe? China is werid though
19:01:22 <Runbunny> The whole world would like that.
19:01:26 <Camail> wait are all stem cells still sensitive, i thought the big deal was fetal stem cells
19:02:52 <reification> i assume if you know the right people in china you can do pretty much whatever human enhancement experiments you want runbun
19:03:04 <Camail> yea, go find the triads
19:03:15 <Runbunny> essentially stem cells can differentiate to any cell. But's really hard to keep them from doing so.
19:03:21 <Camail> and tell them you wanbt to make an ubermensch 
19:03:30 <Dot> then cat girls can be yours runbun
19:03:44 <Runbunny> That's more a russian thing I think Camail.
19:03:52 <Camail> german, but yea
19:04:13 <Runbunny> I don't think germans are like that anymore.
19:04:15 <reification> wasn't china just in the news over "accidental" genetic intelligence enhancement of babies?
19:04:22 <Runbunny> Yeah
19:04:32 <Camail> yea, "aids resistance" 
19:04:46 <Camail> or hiv, most likely
19:04:51 <Runbunny> But the guy who did it was berated a lot by the scientific community.
19:05:07 <Camail> yea because he's kind of a fucking monster
19:05:33 <Camail> it's kinda pandora's box
19:05:48 <Runbunny> and sat the field back a bit as well.

20:56:46 <Runbunny> Zounds, the FFXIV updater is pretty slow :/
20:59:14 <skram> because he fuckin' sucks zounds :(
20:59:45 <skram> doesnt help i get put with ancient lads in my calibration matches either, i should probably be archon
21:01:35 <Zounds> Never really noticed Runbunny.
21:02:07 <Runbunny> compared to steam this, gives me 1/20th of the speed.
21:02:23 <Zounds> I think the crappyness of the Daybreak/SOE launcher made me happy for it to work at all though
21:02:45 <Runbunny> :D
21:03:24 <Runbunny> The league of legends launcher was also pretty slow. I dreaded patch day back when I played.
21:03:29 <reification> only jugg is more picked than lich at divine plus skram
21:03:38 <reification> so i'm pretty sure he is strong
21:05:54 <Zounds> looks like they changed lich quite a bit from when I last played him
21:06:05 <skram> well that would mean im the bad one
21:06:08 <skram> i dont want to believe that
21:06:16 <Zounds> ice armour and sacrifice made him one of the easiest to get value out of
21:06:36 <skram> they redid ice armour and removed sacrifice
21:06:44 <Zounds> yeah was just reading about it
21:06:57 <skram> also he doesnt have any gpm talents??
21:06:59 <skram> whats up with that
21:07:20 <reification> death prophet least picked feelsbadman
21:07:25 <Dot> all you do is ult and win
21:09:04 <Zounds> Steam is fairly good consistently and Battle.net seems okay for the most part too
21:09:10 <Zounds> other launchers tend to suxxors
21:09:29 <skram> bnet launcher has sucked a bunch for me honestly
21:09:48 <skram> gets stuck when finishing downloading updates and stuff
21:11:35 <Dot> .tell phearlock https://www.deviantart.com/yakovlev-vad/art/A-bit-of-friendship-sketch-786909678
21:11:38 <Runbunny> PoE on steam is really bad for me.
21:12:10 <Runbunny> For whatever reason it downloads the update in like 0,01 seconds and then takes 15 min to apply it.
