00:40:31 <Camail> you can mess around with other weapons
00:40:59 <Camail> i went from ig, to ls, to ls/bow, i'm just using whatever i feel like at the time

20:15:28 <Runbunny> I looked into a few things. 
20:15:38 <Runbunny> Like how I am going to make it happen and such.

20:17:54 <Camail> Runbunny  RIP
20:18:04 <Runbunny> Hai Camail.
20:18:15 <Camail> getting warped stones is still a good consolation prize tho
20:18:30 <Runbunny> I guess. I got nothing good today though.
20:19:05 <Camail> i haven't had anything good drop form him yet either
20:19:22 <Camail> havent had a new r7 or r8 in a long time
20:19:37 <Camail> i have all 3 artillery decos which is nice, tho
20:20:35 <Runbunny> I got Mighty today. Which is okay I guess.
20:20:46 <Runbunny> At least I think it was today.
20:23:06 <Camail> mighty is nice, having one of a 3 level skill always gives you more charm flexibility
20:23:32 <Camail> i've got a few sharpness protector ones but i feel like they dont matter since master's touch came into the game
20:24:17 <Camail> also, bow meta uses r6 rath armor, which is funny
20:24:33 <Camail> went full circle with my sets, there
20:24:54 <Camail> just the chest piece tho
20:25:18 <Runbunny> Yeah. Handicraft is also kinda overkill depended on weapon. Since it's you essentially just need 1 hit of white sharpness.

20:46:14 <Runbunny> I am not surprised.
20:53:10 <Camail> apex legends looks interesting
20:53:21 <Camail> and it's made by the titanfall devs
20:53:29 <Camail> we should try it at some point
20:56:33 <Runbunny> Hmm.
20:56:57 <Runbunny> I am intrigued by it. But it's on origin right? 
20:57:04 <Runbunny> I guess it's free to play.
20:57:46 <Camail> yes to all accounts
20:57:56 <Camail> i dunno if i care about origin
20:57:58 <Camail> like, yea it sucks
20:58:03 <Camail> but w/e
20:58:12 <Runbunny> I just don't like EA. 
20:58:14 <Camail> it's not as bad as it was the first few years
20:58:17 <Runbunny> Been boycutting for years.
20:58:18 <Camail> ea does suck dick
20:58:23 <Camail> but they buy studios i like
20:58:33 <Runbunny> and run 'em to the ground!
20:58:35 <Camail> and i dont want to see them fail just cuz they were bought
20:58:59 <Camail> if they make a good game i want to support them, regardless of the publisher

21:00:06 <Runbunny> I don't recall my last EA purchase. 
21:00:29 <Runbunny> I really hope that there are colorblind options in Apex legends. 
21:00:57 <Runbunny> Who, in their right mind, thought that red was an excellent color for a crosshair.
21:01:12 <Camail> red dots are like...a real thing
21:01:58 <Runbunny> but they're usually more glowy?
21:02:18 <Runbunny> I'll download the game.
21:02:27 <Runbunny> Lets explore it together Camail.
21:02:36 <Runbunny> Like true Nakamas.
21:02:46 <Camail> kk
21:02:49 <Camail> its a 3 perosn game
21:02:52 <Camail> Dot`  you there?
21:02:58 <Camail> oh wait you dont want to BR anymore
21:04:02 <Camail> DuB`  wanna try?
21:04:13 <DuB`> Oooh shoots
21:06:18 <DoT|Phone> I'll dl and try it at some point
21:07:31 <Camail> DLing now
21:07:41 <Camail> had tor eset password because i forgot it >_>
21:07:46 <Runbunny> :D
21:08:13 <Camail> add me through my email account adamborgo@gmail.com
21:08:21 <Camail> i dont feel like dealing with nonsense origin names
21:09:23 <Runbunny> I need to figure out my account. I am certain I have one for something but I'll deal with that when origin is installed.
21:10:13 <Camail> sounds about right
21:10:45 <Camail> i have ~16 minutes on the game DL so i'll just get a snack in the between time
21:12:33 <Camail> dub do you know anything about apex
21:12:38 <Camail> its a class shooter br
21:12:42 <Camail> with a respawn mechanic!
21:12:51 <Runbunny> Dub is a master already.
21:12:57 <Camail> thats honestly the most interesting part of the game, that and location pinging
21:13:11 <Runbunny> Location pinging is amazing.
21:13:24 <DuB`> I've watched it
21:16:56 <DuB`> What on earth
21:17:27 <DuB`> Doing password recovery and I had to do the "Select squares with traffic lights, etc" things for 5 minutes straight
21:17:31 <DuB`> Like 20 in a row
21:17:35 <Camail> yea me too
21:17:41 <Camail> i think its because i had a bike one
21:17:48 <Camail> but one of the pictures was a sign with a bike on it
21:17:52 <Camail> and that IS NOT A BIKE
21:18:08 <Camail> i had a philosophical disagreement with the software
21:18:55 <DuB`> A bunch of mine were just like closeups of sidewalk... no, no buses or motorcycles there...
21:19:00 <DuB`> skip skip skip skip
21:19:11 <Camail> Runbunny i think dub is a robot
21:19:14 <Camail> dont tell him that we know
21:19:24 <DuB`> Haha
21:19:31 <Camail> ha....ha...heh
21:19:42 <Runbunny> You should have told me in pictures!
21:20:01 <Camail> or put a line through my text
21:20:10 <DuB`> Yep yep
21:24:30 <Dot`> robot character is obviosly best
