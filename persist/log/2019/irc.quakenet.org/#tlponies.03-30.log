20:00:23 <skram> Archnemesis.
20:00:51 <Zounds> skram my good compeer
20:01:29 <Runbunny> I am not your archnemesis Jonas.
20:02:10 <Runbunny> We both know that for a fact.
20:02:12 <skram> aye zounds pal
20:02:24 <skram> mortal enemies, runbun
20:02:44 <skram> just like in your animes
20:02:50 <Rawr|Fone> Sounds like what an archnemesis would say anders
20:03:01 <Runbunny> I'm not going to have sex with you Jonas.
20:03:06 <skram> o h
20:03:49 <Rawr|Fone> Rude
20:03:52 <Runbunny> oh right it's saturday. That means the upstairs wrestling match will commence shortly.
20:04:02 <skram> so early
20:05:01 <Runbunny> They always talk in loud voices and wrestle on saturdays.
20:05:46 <Runbunny> Anyhoo why do you seem me as your enemy Jonas?
20:07:59 <skram> every adventurer needs a nemesis, anders
20:08:38 <Runbunny> I have always felt like Scandinavia would band together against the world if needed.
20:09:08 <skram> is denmark frodo
20:12:18 <Runbunny> I don't think so. Hairy feet are present though.
20:13:12 <Zounds> you guys hairy at all
20:13:15 <Zounds> i'm very much not so
20:13:41 <skram> yeh a bit
