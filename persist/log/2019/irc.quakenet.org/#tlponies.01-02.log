00:09:31 <Cane> Speaking of starting when everyone else did, have you guys heard of this game called Dota? It looks pretty fun.
00:09:49 <reification> it's funny you should say that cane
00:10:42 <reification> i have decided to start playing dota now
00:11:13 <Cane> Well I'll be damned.
00:11:43 <DuB`> Dota is fun if you remove humans from it -- I only enjoy bot games :P
00:12:14 <reification> well i might need some ppl to come and tell me exactly how i'm being terrible
00:12:27 <Cane> Play with humans, they'll be glad to tell you reif.
00:12:41 <Dot> People are so helpful
00:13:29 <reification> i'm afraid they seem more prone to rage and insults than actually helpful explanations of what to improve
00:14:41 <Cane> I think if I pick it up I'll name myself something appropriate so people know to make fun of me.
00:17:48 <DuB`> Well if you ever need someone to come kill bots I'm here for you. :P
00:19:19 <Runbunny> I played a few weeks ago but I was very discouraged when I queued into the same guy twice on my team. 
00:19:29 <Runbunny> I uninstalled and haven't looked back since.

01:16:22 <skram> dont remember if we left after
01:17:00 <Dot> we lost control of the troll, as the spell was displed by Talis
01:17:11 <Dot> leader of the white cult splinter group
01:17:36 <Dot> we went back out to the woods to try regroup
01:17:40 <Dot> and think
01:18:07 <Dot> then i got that message in my head from her asking us to come talk
01:18:43 <Dot> oh yea, and those trolls attacked us as we rested

15:38:29 <Dot> like arma cross stalker in feel, though currently only raids on maps of various sizes, no complete world map yet
15:38:41 <Cane> No, the company behind that is shit.
15:38:49 <Cane> I had my mind on it until then. =/
15:38:54 <skram> :(
15:38:55 <Cane> Thanks anyway.
15:39:03 <skram> Is it EA
15:39:15 <Dot> no no, its a dodgy rusian company
15:39:17 <Dot> :P
15:39:28 <skram> I thought you liked dodgy russian companies Cane
15:39:30 <Dot> actually i tihnk they are polish, cant recall
15:39:32 <Cane> Russian studio abusing YouTube DMCA stuff to silence YouTubers.
15:39:40 <Cane> That's not the jank I want.
15:39:49 <Cane> I want a Russian studio making shoddy products, not BEING shoddy.
15:40:04 <skram> I get it
15:40:20 <Dot> hmm, i hadnt heard anything about the youtube thing
15:40:34 <skram> youtube is pretty shoddy as well honestly
15:41:31 <Cane> Yeah, a YouTuber who specialized in doing videos for the game did an expose on the devs possibly leaking user information, so the company issued DMCA strikes on all 47 videos he ever made of the game.
15:43:40 <Cane> They also ban you for whatever reason they want.
15:44:00 <Cane> "You were caught having a program installed on your computer that our anti-cheat has deemed unacceptable. Perma banned."

15:45:21 <Cane> But it's mostly the DMCA stuff that makes me too antsy to play it.
15:45:43 <BioPhone> Tarkov... I should try that game. But I've got lots of new stuff to play
15:51:25 <Dot> well i have key bio for 2 week trial if you want, expires on the 6th on Jan i believe

19:10:09 <Camail> yea, the best part is that people probably made an alt just to try hacks, but it's gonna fuck with their main account
19:10:47 <Camail> just because valve doesn't hardware ban doesn't mean they dont care what accounts are one your pc

19:23:03 <Camail> i'm guessing vacnet, but no clue
19:23:19 <Camail> these are steam-wide stats

19:52:42 <Camail> 19 minutes and 20 seconds, close enough
19:52:58 <Zounds> Steam says I've played dota 2 for 144 hours
19:53:03 <Zounds> there's literally zero chance that's correct
19:53:17 <Dot> steam counts menu time
19:53:18 <Camail> too high or too low
19:53:23 <Dot> always telling lies
19:53:28 <Camail> and if you watched TI in client
19:53:31 <Zounds> Though it also says I've played CS:GO for 160 which is just BS of the highest horder
19:53:33 <Zounds> highest order*
19:53:34 <Zounds> too high
19:53:37 <Zounds> way too high :P
