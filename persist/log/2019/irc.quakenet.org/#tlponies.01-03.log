20:09:32 <Camail> i tried like 10 times, and killed it once
20:09:48 <Camail> but it died as we all carted to ecliptic sooo
20:09:59 <Camail> but it counted for the weekly!
20:18:53 <Runbunny> lel.
20:19:36 <Runbunny> I can't get the weapon I want till next Kulve Taroth.
20:20:32 <Camail> we had a chinese guy on support
20:20:54 <Camail> despite the charge lance not knowing how to tank, he kept us alive,  aggressively 
20:21:03 <Camail> most of the time i was back to full before i hit the ground
20:21:46 <Camail> also had a run where a chinese guy was showing off and trying to jump every ecliptic meteor, and it cost us the run T_T
20:22:19 <Camail> these 200 HR boys are weird sometimes
20:25:32 <Runbunny> Indeed.
