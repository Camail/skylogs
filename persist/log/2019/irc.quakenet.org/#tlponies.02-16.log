00:40:12 <Bio> more proof on the mountain that anime was a mistake
00:40:16 <Camail> 1X scopes are king
00:40:38 <Camail> anyone using 2x or higher on an smg/rifle are cowards
00:42:25 <Runbunny> buff snipers.
00:53:42 <skram> buffing snipers would be a mistake i think
00:54:24 <Camail> snipers shouldn't be that good
00:54:49 <Camail> even with the dumbed down movement, its still enough hitbox manipulation to make sniping really hard
00:59:30 <Camail> snipers are good if the other team is forced to change positions
00:59:40 <Camail> you can punish it from just about any distance
01:01:46 <Camail> do we wanna apex more?
