00:54:30 <Dot> pretty good. hows your holiday between jobs?
00:55:02 <Crisium> well i dont start holiday foi almost 2 weeks, gotta go through the notice period
00:55:14 <Crisium> how is your job going.  been a few months now right?
01:02:10 <Dot> yea, 3 months, its great, i get to actually do intresting stuff
01:02:23 <Dot> program control PLC's
01:20:06 <DuB`> Been looking forward to seeing mario oddysey run, never seen one.
01:39:50 <Runbunny> Camail, have you done all the side quests in order to get handicraft III charm?
01:40:11 <Camail> now, doesnt it just require the voucher thing?
01:40:15 <Camail> you can SOS to get that
01:40:25 <Camail> no*
01:40:36 <Runbunny> idk.
01:40:44 <Camail> i honestly tried to start 100% but some ome the optionals missions take too long to get
01:40:45 <Runbunny> What do I SOS to get that?
01:41:02 <Camail> something something wind
01:41:06 <Camail> it has like 4 monsters
01:41:22 <Camail> https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/The+White+Winds+of+the+New+World
01:41:46 <Camail> just filter your sos to these stats
01:42:02 <Runbunny> I have done everything up till rank 7. I have done most of the rank 7s. 
01:42:15 <Runbunny> But there's a hidden rank 4 one I haven't done either.
01:42:17 <Camail> its too much of a pain to get orange complete on all stars
01:42:28 <Runbunny> Yes.
01:42:31 <Camail> the only rank 4 one i dont have is a monster hunt
01:42:45 <Camail> and i dont feel like hunting LR tobi 5 times
01:43:13 <Camail> how many times have you beaten at teostra
01:43:21 <Camail> i have like a 5% success record...
01:43:47 <Camail> well, around 2 out of 20, so more like a 10% record
01:44:53 <Runbunny> I haven't even tried.
01:45:05 <Runbunny> I want to get the augment for my gunlance but it doesn't drop
02:14:07 <Runbunny> Yo Camail.

02:16:29 <Runbunny> idk
02:16:30 <Camail> wtffff
02:16:39 <Runbunny> but that is one of the worst things I have watched.
02:16:42 <Camail> i was not expecting that
02:16:53 <Camail> i mean, at least there was tiddy
02:17:01 <Runbunny> True.
02:17:10 <Camail> tsundere tiddy, the best kind

02:24:48 <DuB`> :D
02:34:05 <Camail> we should division after you guys dnd tomorrow
02:35:47 <Camail> Runbunny  we could run some tempered dragons if you want
02:36:36 <Runbunny> I figured I should go sleep.
02:36:44 <Runbunny> Mayhaps tomorrow?
02:40:16 <Camail> kk
02:40:31 <Camail> i played lbg mostly today, gonna go back to ig
02:40:54 <Camail> tbh everying other than at tesotra feels like a joke now
02:41:10 <Camail> even behemoth was just like... w/e
02:41:25 <Camail> still a fun fight tho
02:41:49 <Camail> the flash immunity will be fun on extremoth
02:42:28 <Dot> cam, i have work so will need to go sleep right after
02:42:41 <Camail> boo, thats fine
02:52:10 <Runbunny> Ugh.
02:52:16 <Runbunny> That's going to be bothersome.
02:52:26 <Runbunny> The wind takes up so much space.

03:30:06 <Camail> hm?
03:30:31 <Camail> oh right, behemoth
03:30:38 <Camail> it's not that bad if you play around it
03:30:50 <Camail> just make sure to have the person it's chasing run away to the walls
03:31:08 <Camail> you can get like 4 of them before that start really constricting space
03:31:29 <Camail> its just the dummy DPS who keep fighting and spawn one in the middle
03:43:58 <Runbunny> What do you save the flashes for then?
03:44:52 <Runbunny> You can reset aggro. But I, for one, would love to have aggro.
04:15:56 <DuB`> That $200k in 20 minutes on AGDQ to hit $2m :D
04:25:17 <Runbunny> Pretty crazy.
04:31:21 <Runbunny> Also Anime is real, confirmed.
04:36:46 <Camail> you dont flash anything
04:37:10 <Camail> flashes aren't terribly useful once you start doing tempered stuff
04:37:32 <Camail> generally you get 4, and in behemoth's case you get none
04:37:51 <Camail> and something like teostra is just too fast to reliably sheath and flashbang
04:41:20 <Runbunny> I have solo'd a bit of tempered Teostra recently. And I have done just that every super nova.
04:56:40 <Camail> AT tesostra is waaaay quicker
04:56:44 <Camail> teostra*

12:36:26 <Dot> relax
12:38:23 <Cane> Dot, there's Dota right now.
12:38:33 <Cane> https://www.twitch.tv/pgl_dota2
12:38:44 <Cane> Grand finals of this qualifying minor tournament.
12:38:49 <Cane> Gambit vs Ehome. They already knocked out OG.
12:38:58 <Cane> This is the first game of the finals about to start.
12:49:22 <Dot> i dont recignise half the heros because of skins cane, lol
12:50:28 <Runbunny> Dot I sent you a thing. pls respond
12:50:39 <Dot> oh, thing!
12:50:45 <Dot> AARDVARK
12:51:15 <Dot> as much as you want, dont let them hug you
12:51:15 <Cane> Yeah skins are annoying.
13:00:28 <Dot> though the pgasus is pretty
13:00:34 <Dot> Alicorn when?
13:00:45 <Dot> then remove the old guy
13:00:53 <Dot> 3 step plan to get celestia into dota
13:02:26 <Cane> Dot, you've never played it you said?
13:02:39 <Dot> i played a bit of dota
13:03:00 <Cane> Why did I think you never played it? I think I misunderstood something you said about it.
13:03:09 <Dot> but i missed the main TLP ship due to exams, so everyone was already far beyond me
13:03:16 <Dot> im REALLY bad
13:03:32 <Dot> so "playing dota" might be generous :P
13:03:59 <Dot> i was also in South Africa at the time, so 250+ ping 
13:04:05 <Dot> sometimes 380
13:04:30 <Cane> Oof.
13:05:11 <Dot> i met the full might of dota toxicity 
13:05:35 <skram> dota toxicity is equally present at all skill levels Dot
13:05:55 <Dot> i dont doubt, but having 300 ping gets it focused on you
13:06:08 <Dot> and playing with ppl that pull you to far higher ranks
13:07:19 <Dot> i did really enjoy tlp full stacks though
13:08:07 <Cane> Yeah, I'm sad I'll never experience one of those.
13:08:46 <Rawr|Fone> I started playing pretty much when everyone quit
13:09:14 <Rawr|Fone> I'd like to play again if more people wanted to probably
13:09:45 <Dot> rawr pls, you dont play on PC anymore
13:09:50 <Dot> your too old for that now
13:10:08 <Cane> Yeah, I've just been watching tutorials, tournaments, replays, and playing a lot of bot games, mostly because I want to understand what the fuck is going on in the particle-effect mess that is Dota 2 team fights.
13:10:10 <Rawr|Fone> I don't play on console either
13:10:15 <Cane> Not to mention the subtleties of the laning phase.
13:10:49 <Rawr|Fone> I think you learn best by just playing lots of games
13:11:16 <Dot> if we tried i bet we could get TLP occasional dota stacks
13:11:18 <Cane> I disagree. I think I would *never* know a lot of the subtleties of the laning phase and item management if Purge hadn't done a ton of tutorial videos.
13:12:50 <Dot> i think like most things, you need to play a lot to put into practice what you see in tutorials otherwise it wont do anything
13:13:00 <Dot> but videos allow you to notice a lot you wouldnt otherwise
13:34:13 <Dot> skram, what doing?
13:39:22 <Cane> Dot, what heroes did you mess around with when you played? =)
13:39:34 <Dot> hmm, got to recall names
13:39:42 <Rawr|Fone> Treeeee
13:39:43 <Dot> crystal maiden because easiest hero
13:39:51 <Dot> i was never good enough to play tree :(
13:40:00 <Dot> wind runner was fun
13:40:02 <Cane> Crystal Maiden is the best hero that one of your team mates, never you, can play.
13:40:05 <Cane> That aura. <3
13:40:17 <Cane> She's pretty fun.
13:40:20 <Dot> a bit of wisp
13:40:27 <Cane> Io is so good.
13:40:36 <Cane> Dot support 4 life huh
13:40:42 <Cane> Still Gorge, even in Dota 2.
13:40:44 <Dot> haha, yea, i enjoy the supports
13:40:59 <Dot> i tried some omni, was bad
13:41:25 <Cane> Back when Omni was super meta?
13:41:42 <Dot> i mainly stuck to supports
13:41:43 <Cane> I haven't seen him ONCE in any game since I started watching Dota.
13:41:45 <Dot> bought those wards
13:41:49 <Cane> Yeah man.
13:41:52 <Cane> Ward up the map.
13:42:08 <Dot> catties enjoyed using me as bait
13:43:29 <Dot> i also really enjoyed, cant recall the name... can swap places with heroes, has a nice aura
13:43:42 <Rawr|Fone> Vengeful spirit
13:43:46 <Dot> thats the one
13:44:15 <Dot> you cane? what you enjoy playing?
13:45:03 <Cane> I haven't messed with Vengeful Spirit yet, but I like her abilities a lot. She's on my list of heroes to check out soon(tm).
13:45:32 <Cane> I've been picking loads of characters I was interested in. I mostly nailed the ones I thought I'd like.
13:45:39 <skram> Being useful with Vengefuls ult is really really hard
13:46:01 <Cane> Like for support, Phoenix and Io. I looked over their abilities and look and everything, and when I played them, they clicked more than when I played other supports.
13:46:14 <Cane> But, and I hate to be so fucking predictable
13:46:22 <Cane> Of course I like what everyone else likes.
13:46:36 <Cane> You can guess it in 3 probably.
13:46:50 <Cane> Just, stereotypical fan favorite cool hero.
13:46:56 <Rawr|Fone> Is it pudge
13:47:03 <skram> theres like 150 of them, cane!
13:47:18 <Cane> There's 150 of them, and 145 is not in the top 5 most played heroes list, and this one is.
13:47:33 <Cane> Not Pudge.
13:47:56 <Cane> I should try him though.
13:48:23 <skram> Is it yurnero
13:48:57 <skram> or kunkka maybe
13:48:57 <Dot> pheonix was put in right after i stopped, he did look fun
13:49:12 <Cane> Oh is Jug super popular?
13:49:18 <Cane> I'll be damned, I guess he is.
13:49:21 <Cane> Spin too good.
13:49:27 <Dot> i did play crystal maiden sister a fair bit
13:49:28 <skram> spin2win bby
13:49:29 <Dot> starts with an L
13:49:37 <skram> Lina?
13:49:38 <Cane> Lina.
13:49:40 <Dot> yea
13:49:44 <Dot> names are hard
13:49:47 <Dot> BAZZAP
13:50:06 <skram> Lion also has BAZZAP
13:50:21 <skram> Is Axe one of them cane
13:50:37 <Cane> Nope, but he is top 10.
13:50:51 <Cane> Top 5 are Pudge, Lion, Phantom Assassin, Juggernaut, and Invoker as of writing.
13:51:06 <Cane> I was surprised to see Lion up there.
13:51:13 <skram> Invoker then
13:51:17 <Cane> There you go.
13:51:19 <skram> He has the most buttons and you like buttons
13:51:24 <Cane> And you know me.
13:51:25 <skram> excellent reasoning.
13:51:51 <skram> Invoker real fun though
13:51:56 <Cane> He's so great.
13:52:10 <Cane> Invoker + Agh's = lol
13:52:36 <skram> I usually go quas/exort and rush double fire friends
13:52:58 <Cane> "Throughout the eons I have been known by many names... but my true name of power... is Carl."
13:53:28 <skram> voice lines in dota are pretty great
13:54:29 <skram> https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/dota2_gamepedia/d/d2/Wind_kill_06.mp3
13:55:59 <Cane> LOL
13:56:01 <Cane> That's fantastic.
13:57:34 <Cane> And fun fact, the voice of Invoker is also the voice of Spy and Pyro in TF2.
13:57:42 <Cane> So, yeah. I'm just picturing Pyro hmmhmming his way through Dota now.
13:59:12 <skram> Many of the TF2 VAs got voices in dota2
13:59:29 <skram> john patrick lowrie (who did sniper) got 5 or 6 i think
13:59:38 <skram> ES, SF, pudge, doom
13:59:48 <Cane> Oh shit, he's Doom? That's great.
14:00:01 <Cane> Now that you mention it, I definitely hear it a bit in Pudge.
14:00:44 <skram> His wife did Death Prophet
14:00:54 <skram> and also GLaDOS
14:01:43 <Cane> Yup, Ellen McLain.
14:01:51 <Cane> She's also Brood. I know that because I also play Brood.
14:02:00 <Cane> She's probably my 2nd most played atm.
14:02:02 <skram> you jerk
14:02:33 <skram> Brood is the bane of my existance regardless of what I play somehow
14:02:40 <Cane> So my heroes are top 5 newbie trap man and annoying as fuck bottom tier.
14:02:56 <Cane> Broodmother has so many counters but damn she's fun. And good.
14:03:23 <Cane> Also RIP Rubick. =(
14:03:27 <skram> My most played is Windrunner by a lot
14:03:37 <skram> She's also the hero that I have the lowest winrate with ...
14:03:49 <Rawr|Fone> Hmmm
14:04:00 <Rawr|Fone> Jonas snela
14:04:22 <Cane> What position did you play her in?
14:04:28 <Cane> She can do a bit of everything.
14:04:40 <skram> solo offlane usually
14:06:50 <skram> I usually rush MBoots and mek and then fuck up in midgame because no damage :p
14:08:53 <Dot> has anti-mage ever stopped being populour?
14:08:57 <Cane> Hahah I haven't seen a Mek since I started playing. It's one of those mythical items of the past metas, I think.
14:08:58 <Dot> in tournies
14:09:06 <Cane> Dunno, he's always been around while I've been watching.
14:09:18 <Dot> mek was the best! how did it drop off
14:09:23 <skram> think so?
14:09:51 <skram> Many things have changed since I played a lot, Cane :P
14:10:10 <Runbunny> Mek is build into guardian greaves now
14:10:40 <Runbunny> I see picked up often enough.
14:11:19 <Cane> Still only 2% of games Runbunny.
14:11:23 <Cane> It's fallen off tremendously.
14:11:53 <Runbunny> Hmm.
14:13:51 <skram> Im sorta sceptical of this thing, salve <1% and tango 2%?
14:15:08 <skram> Usually you'd do min 3 tangos per game, no? Maybe 6 if you're 4-6 pos
14:20:00 <Dot> this new dota scares me skram, too many changes
14:20:42 <skram> its not that different dot
14:20:47 <Cane> That's Dotabuff, the problem it has is it only counts the items in your inventory at the end of a game, so of course no one has Tangos then.
14:20:56 <Cane> So it's only good for checking common items people have when the game is done.
14:21:24 <skram> Yeh thats true
14:22:09 <skram> Greaves might be more likely to be in your inventory at the end anyways, as its 5700 cost iirc vs. a mere mek which is 2700 (??)
14:22:49 -!- DoT|Phone [~Dot@50.115.159.143.dyn.plus.net] has joined #tlponies
14:22:51 <skram> 5375 vs 2275 actually
14:23:01 <Runbunny> that explains the low prevelance of mek
14:23:47 <Cane> If you go for Mekansm and therefore Greaves as an upgrade, it would be super rare that you'd then sell it for something else. So either way, people rarely end the game with Mekansm (1.21% of games) or Greaves (2% of games).
14:24:05 <Cane> But also mind that it's a support item.
14:25:27 <skram> Support items are for SUCKERS
14:25:49 <skram> 1st item midas on every hero
14:30:25 <Cane> I always hate to see Io losing.
14:30:38 <Cane> He's the most selfless hero.
14:33:03 <Cane> ...
14:33:23 <Cane> Okay good job but the mega creep will eat your face now.
14:33:53 <skram> believeeeeeee it

14:41:43 <Cane> There we go.
14:43:46 <skram> hahah
14:43:51 <skram> 71 fucking minutes into the game
14:45:46 <Cane> I've also been watching the 22 minute recap of the "200 Min longest pro game" cast.
14:45:58 <Cane> From like 2015.
14:46:14 <Cane> Casters growing increasingly frustrating.
14:47:40 <Cane> Went so long the map started glitching out.
14:51:30 <Dot> lol
14:52:25 <Cane> Is C9 just a meme in like every game?
14:52:48 <Cane> In Overwatch it means everyone jumps off the objective when you're winning and lose.
14:53:58 <Cane> In Dota it was the 200 minute game where they refused to end it and ended up losing.
14:58:49 <Cane> Hurry up and pick heroes, I've got food coming.
14:58:59 <Cane> Also there's a Jakiro.
14:59:06 <Cane> Which I now associate almost entirely with Jakiroshy lol
14:59:16 <Cane> Ooh, Luna.
14:59:17 <skram> hahah
14:59:18 <skram> samew
14:59:40 <Cane> Or, as she says it, Luuna.
14:59:50 <skram> looona
15:00:45 <skram> patience, nåååva
15:01:01 <Dot> rawr
15:01:03 <Dot> its a meepo
15:01:07 <Cane> OOOOOOOOOOOH YEAH
15:01:16 <Cane> We're doing this.
15:01:16 <Dot> who is far left?
15:01:22 <Cane> On what team? lol
15:01:28 <Dot> far far left
15:01:33 <Dot> gambit
15:01:36 <skram> Elder...Guardian?
15:01:40 <Cane> Elder Titan.
15:01:44 <Dot> dont know him
15:01:51 <skram> Titan yes
15:01:59 <skram> Think he was introduced before phoenix
15:02:54 <skram> He's got ghosts and stomps his feet sometimes
15:03:41 <Cane> I still love this picture. http://i.imgur.com/tQWJBO2.jpg
15:03:42 <Dot> a stompy boi?
15:03:52 <Dot> hahaha cane
15:04:04 <Cane> That was at a League of Legends tournament. The other side of the sign says "Pick Meepo".
15:04:08 <Cane> Rael is such a fucking troll, I love it.
15:04:21 <skram> He's basically earthshaker but with ghosts
15:04:38 <skram> thats rael? hahah, didnt even realize
15:05:05 <skram> how could i forget such luscious locks
15:05:06 <Cane> Hahah yup.
15:06:15 <Cane> Definitely time to watch Meepo though.
15:06:42 <skram> Meepers is such a nightmare if he gets going
15:06:55 <Cane> So hard to play too.
15:07:03 <Cane> I like micro heroes though.
15:07:26 <skram> I can barely control one boy, who do you expect me to control FOUR?
15:09:31 <Cane> I wish micro heroes were better, but you rarely see them in big tournaments.
15:10:30 <Cane> Except Beastmaster who is common.
15:10:50 <Cane> But his boar is pretty easy to control and he tends to keep it close.
15:14:13 <Rawr|Fone> Meepo is the best hero
15:14:19 <Rawr|Fone> My most played
15:14:59 <Dot> all that spam rawr
15:15:20 <Rawr|Fone> So much
15:20:43 <Cane> Rawr played Meepo? Respect. <3
15:21:28 <Cane> Who were the best TLP Dota 2 players?
15:21:48 <Cane> Was Catties just good at stuff as usual?
15:23:11 <skram> hmm
15:23:12 <Dot> catties went mid evoker every game till he was great at it
15:23:22 <Dot> ,id or feed
15:23:28 <Dot> mid*
15:23:42 <skram> Catties was leagues above everyone since the start honstly
15:23:43 <Cane> Surrender the middle lane to me, or I shall provide catering for the dire team.
15:24:04 <skram> hsab was prettty good, xiberia was on catties' level
15:24:12 <Dot> i liked xibs
15:24:52 <skram> Yeah he was cool even when the rest of us were bad, unlike catties lol
15:25:17 <Cane> Yeah I heard about that.
15:25:43 <skram> I still have that unfinished video project around somewhere
15:27:01 <Cane> Dat Chrono.
15:27:29 <skram> Not at all worth it for ehome though
15:27:34 <skram> gambit
15:27:52 <Cane> Yeah, Meepo. That RIP.

18:40:48 <Zounds> what prompted you to start playing dota Cane 
18:41:02 <Cane> Hey Zounds. <3
18:41:14 <Cane> Wanting to see tournament games as something other than a confusing mess of particle effects.
18:41:36 <Zounds> I see ^^
18:43:03 <DuB`> I do enjoy watching doto
18:43:49 <Cane> And I'm a big fan, in a games-are-art way, of games that manage to convey the sense of a character through very simple gameplay. There's something pure about getting a whole personality out of nothing but voice lines, win quotes, poses, animations, clothing, and the way they fight.
18:43:59 <Cane> Fighting games are pretty good at that.
18:47:25 <Zounds> I don't really follow many esports anymore but DotA is certainly up there in one that's entertaining to watch
19:55:01 <Dot> whats all up to?
20:02:38 <Runbunny> I am heading out.
20:02:46 <Dot> Runbun, its cold outside
20:02:49 <Dot> and sunday
20:03:45 <Runbunny> Sounds perfect.
20:05:28 <Dot> be safe bun
20:06:01 <Runbunny> It's sunday
20:06:10 <Runbunny> a bit rainy and it's cold outside.
