18:19:01 <Runbunny> Are you alright Bio?
18:37:31 <Camail> Runbunny  i think i might try and get the thunder bow, but i know farming for a specific kt weapon is dooming you to failure
18:37:54 <Camail> maybe just an r8 bow
18:38:11 <Camail> but crafting ammo/coating is such a drag
18:39:14 <Runbunny> well
18:39:27 <Runbunny> I don't think there is any KT at the moment.
18:39:34 <Runbunny> So that option is out.
18:48:44 <skram> Dot are you watching gta
18:53:47 <Dot> nope
18:55:30 <Camail> oh did kt end
18:56:17 <Camail> teostra gamma set has the mastery bonus and only needs 3 pieces
18:57:05 <Camail> meaning i can probably use that + free element to use the kt weapons
19:03:10 <Camail> i just need to beat teostra one more time...
19:10:24 <Dot> is it a pokemans race now skram?
19:10:45 <skram> heck yeh
