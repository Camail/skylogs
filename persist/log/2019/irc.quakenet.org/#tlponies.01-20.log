02:53:14 <Phearlock> Yeah I think Mechwarrior online is pretty fun still Runbunny, not too hard to get into. Gonna sleep now though
02:53:47 <Phearlock> Also can be hard to find a group-queue game outside of US primetime
03:23:29 <Cane> https://www.twitch.tv/dotastarladder_en if people want Dota to watch.
