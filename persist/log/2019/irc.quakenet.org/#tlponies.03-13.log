12:38:55 <Runbunny> I mean you can be emotionally invested in something out of geniune love or interest. Not because you feel that since you were emotionally invested you have to continue to be.
12:39:34 <Runbunny> Are you suggesting that Dot is only caring because he once cared Rawr|Phone?
12:39:45 <Rawr|Phone> Sure, but then it's not a sunken cost runbun

17:07:47 <Camail> Runbunny  that sounds fun, but i am still soooo burnt out on monhun
17:08:31 <BioPone> Runbunny my company name is dSPACE
17:08:42 <Camail> also i'm learning dmc5 and my muscle memory is crossing some serious wires, i'd need to play mhw exclusively for a few days to get back in
17:08:53 <Camail> who put the d in space, bio
17:08:56 <Camail> did you fuck space
17:08:57 <Runbunny> Should probably just break till next festival and or expansion.
17:09:08 <Camail> yea next festival was my thought
17:09:13 <Runbunny> That's the goal of the company Camail. 
17:09:23 <Runbunny> They'll put the D in space.
17:09:44 <Camail> so eventually it will be Sdpace, then Spdace
17:09:50 <Camail> careful you don't go through the other end
17:10:08 <Camail> that would cause some serious internal bleeding

20:43:47 <Dot> Crisium
20:43:57 <Crisium> howdy
20:44:37 <Camail> DuB`  port forwarding is usually the answer to that
20:44:42 <Runbunny> open your ports Dub.
20:45:06 <Camail> like the whore that you are
20:45:21 <Runbunny> Not all 'em.
20:45:25 <DuB`> I dun have access to router or anything
20:45:33 <Runbunny> Sure you do
20:45:43 <Runbunny> 192.168.0.1
20:45:47 <Runbunny> try admin
20:45:55 <Runbunny> and password for password.
20:46:02 <DuB`> wha
20:46:02 <Camail> or no password
20:46:08 <Runbunny> or that.
20:46:12 <Camail> defaults woo
20:46:18 <Runbunny> Indeed.
20:46:39 <Camail> runbun has shifted his temperament when confronted with the chance to be a digital criminal
20:46:54 <Camail> i can practically see him flipping the butterfly knife around and licking the edge
20:47:27 <Runbunny> The indian phone scammers called me and said they had detected that some hackers were using my computer to do illegal things.
20:47:31 <Camail> dub have you looked up the problem at all or are you going on the error
20:47:48 <Camail> lul, hackers
20:47:53 <Runbunny> I explained to them that I was the one doing it.
20:48:02 <Runbunny> They reassured me that it wasn't me.
20:48:13 <Camail> the fools
20:48:23 <Camail> if they knew what was happening on your computer they would never call again
20:48:28 <DuB`> Looked it up a bunch, it's just a generic "connection error" message
20:48:38 <Camail> you could be like that one person and let them remote into your system and give them a trojan
20:49:20 <Camail> try turning off your firewall dub
20:49:25 <Runbunny> I haven't messed around with virtual machines at all.
20:49:27 <Camail> or letting factorio has full access
20:49:38 <Camail> VMs are just like, things
20:49:44 <Camail> nothing complicated about them
20:49:55 <Camail> unless your using an OS you've never used before
20:50:07 <Runbunny> Probably not. But I'd rather not give someone access to my computer.
20:50:23 <Camail> well duh
20:50:34 <Runbunny> I should explain that I use linux next time they call.
20:50:39 <Camail> robo calls are REALLY bad in the US right now
20:51:39 <Camail> DuB`  another option is trying to use a port thats already open
20:51:49 <Camail> you can tell it to use whatever port you want
20:51:57 <DuB`> wha wha
20:52:21 <Runbunny> Yeah, I think they're illegal in Denmark though. I have never had it happen except after talking to customer service and they asked me to give feedback.
20:52:38 <Camail> oh also my router is 192.168.1.1 so you can try that as well
20:52:57 <Camail> DuB`  so whenever you connect tot he server its ip:port
20:53:08 <Camail> whoever makes the server can change the port
20:53:24 <Runbunny> Dub get on discord. I'll try to explain it to you.,
20:53:31 <Runbunny> If you want.
20:53:45 <Camail> will you hold his hand?
20:53:53 <Runbunny> No.
20:54:09 <Camail> boo
20:56:08 <Camail> https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/ lets you test ports
20:56:18 <Camail> just did a quick google tho, might be better options
20:57:39 <Camail> also maybe the only person who needs to port forward is the host
20:57:48 <Camail> and if you cant access your router maybe your brother can
20:58:45 <Camail> access his router*
20:59:39 <Runbunny> dang.
20:59:44 <Runbunny> I forgot to hold his hand :/
20:59:52 <Runbunny> I was planning to do it sneakily.
20:59:56 <DuB`> wew
21:01:27 <Dot> Dub https://imgur.com/gallery/7moaw2N
21:01:27 <Camail> ah, what was wrong
21:03:33 <Runbunny> They were on a local network. So we figured out that they could just connect directly using LAN IPs.
21:03:56 <skram> whoah
21:04:07 <skram> thats some old school tactics, anders
21:04:23 <Dot> i refer to my cooment half an hour ago
21:04:26 <Dot> [20:41:16] <Dot> do you not sir right next to him?
21:04:38 <skram> got any crossover ethernet cables
21:04:50 <DuB`> But we're plugged into DIFFERENT parts of the wall :P
21:06:24 <Camail> dub pls
21:06:33 <Runbunny> Hehe Jonas.
21:06:48 <Dot> once a cable goes into the wall camail its in the magic twilight zone
21:06:54 <Camail> most games dont let you LAN anymore
21:07:08 <Camail> cool that factorio does
21:07:41 <Golly> ah the olden days where you could just copy over a game an bam, instant lan game
21:07:56 <Runbunny> I was expecting having to port forward.
21:08:22 <skram> sometimes you'd need to download no-cd cracks from disreputable websites golly
21:08:36 <Camail> which you really cant do unless you have access to your router, no?
21:08:47 <Dot> key gens had the best music
