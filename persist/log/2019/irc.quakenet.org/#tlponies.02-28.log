17:48:59 <Camail> pls
17:49:16 <Zounds> Hello Camail 
17:50:00 <Camail> hi
17:50:03 <Dot> ty
17:50:18 <Runbunny> Camail.
17:50:45 <Runbunny> I did the 3 boss rushes in Hollow knight and it awarded me with another boss rush.
17:51:07 <Runbunny> I don't think I am going to bother with 112% completion.
17:52:22 <Camail> yea all those gates are boss rushes
17:53:25 <Camail> but yea that sucks
17:53:42 <Camail> i mean, i get it. for the people who love the combat that's nice
17:53:57 <Camail> and i do love the combat! i just hate repetition
17:59:15 <Runbunny> the worst is just that like the first 6 bosses are really easy but have attacks that just waste time.
17:59:36 <Runbunny> So you fuck up on the last guy. Have fun doing it all again.
18:07:39 <Camail> yea having a new boss at the end of a boss rush is legit kinda bad design
18:07:42 <Camail> like....what
18:08:24 <Camail> but hell, its 3 peple
18:08:30 <Camail> there's no one else there to tell them to stop
18:09:00 <Camail> they have such an insane work ethic that they can churn out this kind of thing just because they feel like it
18:09:34 <Runbunny> Yeh. 
18:09:50 <Camail> and they are so inside their own heads, which is true for everyone, it ends up being....meh
18:09:56 <Runbunny> I like the fact that you can challenge every boss and there's "hard mode" for everyone.
18:10:08 <Camail> yea
18:10:32 <Camail> i get it, it's just really really not made for me
18:10:38 <Camail> the base game is, absolutely
18:10:49 <Runbunny> I agree.
18:10:52 <Camail> and i trust them 100% with the sequel 
18:11:20 <Camail> and it bums me out that i miss story content by not doing the boss rush
18:11:30 <Camail> and it doesn't feel right looking it up
18:12:28 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/esl_csgo TL plays in 20 minutes
18:29:40 <Runbunny> That Tie though.
18:30:36 <Camail> it's important
18:30:57 <Camail> also, anyone on commentary who says "pressure is off" is kinda an idiot
18:31:10 <Camail> the pressure is never off, what the hell?
18:31:41 <Camail> you don't get this far in your career as a player without have an unquenchable thirst to win
18:32:20 <Camail> frustrates me when analysts completely lose perspective, especially when they were players once

18:38:38 <Zounds> frog and rabbit seem cool, monkeys kinda cute I guess
18:41:09 <Runbunny> Maybe he meant you Camail.
18:41:13 <Runbunny> There is no pressure on you.
18:41:24 <Camail> well that's also a lie
18:47:50 <Runbunny> Zounds, Did the roulette reset?
