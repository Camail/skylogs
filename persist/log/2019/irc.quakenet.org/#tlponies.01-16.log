12:03:27 <Rawr|Fone> Reef reef
12:08:32 <Cane> Hiya reif, Dot, Rawr. <3
12:08:37 <Cane> Dota was fun yesterday.
12:14:16 <Rawr|Fone> Good afternoon cane
12:14:46 <Cane> I think my goal with Dota is now "beat Rawr".
12:14:54 <Cane> Figure out a way to deal with mid.
12:17:49 <Rawr|Fone> I haven't played in so long
12:17:55 <Rawr|Fone> My last match was in 2016
12:18:20 <Rawr|Fone> I'm surprised how easy it was to get into the mechanics again
12:20:31 <Cane> Yeah you did well. To be fair, the only vs people game you did was playing mid against someone who'd literally never played against a human being before.
12:20:59 <Cane> It was pretty stifling for me.
12:21:30 <Cane> I'd like to do that a bunch more if at all possible.
12:22:16 <Rawr|Fone> I guess I would get destroyed if I played against someone at my old mmr :p
12:22:30 <Cane> What was your MMR?
12:22:51 <Cane> catties
12:22:56 <Cane> was pretty good, I know that
12:23:46 <Rawr|Fone> I think I got close to 5k but I didn't reach it
12:23:56 <Rawr|Fone> It has been wiped
12:24:04 <Rawr|Fone> 4.8 or 4.9 maybe
12:24:43 <Rawr|Fone> Catties was better I think, but I started playing after he left already
12:25:01 <Cane> Yeah, so I was playing against at least a 4.4k in mid.
12:25:26 <Cane> For my first game of Dota.
12:25:32 <Runbunny> It really rough when you're out of it for a bit.
12:26:02 <Runbunny> I got so destroyed that my teammates thought I bought my account :/
12:27:39 <reification> hello dotties, cane et al.
12:28:32 <DoT|Phone1> lol Angel
12:28:47 <DoT|Phone1> hey cane <3

12:29:34 <reification> you heal those towers dot
12:29:51 <DoT|Phone1> so healed
12:29:55 <Cane> Dot, I support you in your entish endeavours.
12:31:49 <DoT|Phone1> and I support you by being an ent, what a great circle.
13:00:31 <Cane> I'll probably swap a lot between Invoker mid and Rubick roaming, and whatever else for variety.

13:21:43 <Rawr|Fone> I pretty much only played hard carries that couldn't fight early game and then won late game

13:45:52 <Runbunny> Game was sped up a lot.
13:46:17 <Runbunny> Like one of the reasons Invoker isn't that popular anymore is that he is too slow.

14:29:15 <Cane> Phew, it works.
14:30:23 <DoT|Phone1> panic over
14:51:38 <DoT|Phone1> you find a mic yet Rawr?
14:57:20 <DoT|Phone1> guess not
14:58:41 <DoT|Phone1> and cane I don't know how the  3v3 was from the other side but Rawr teleporting constantly, I couldn't even keep track of where he was never mind keep up
15:00:06 <Cane> Yeah it's the power of Meepo, you need a coordinated team to hit his weaknesses so he can pretty much abuse people.
15:00:17 <Cane> I didn't see him much once the laning phase ended, until it was full on defense mode.
15:00:25 <Cane> I lost mid vs him but I kept pace ok.
15:00:42 <Cane> The way you win mid against Meepo though is having supports come over to help gank him.
15:00:46 <Cane> So for me it was just prac.
15:00:57 <Cane> Meepo gets rolling SO much faster than Invoker.
15:00:59 <DoT|Phone1> he was doing things like jungling and pushing 2 lanes
15:01:14 <Cane> Yep, that's the Meepo.
15:01:47 <Cane> I love micro heroes.
15:01:49 <DoT|Phone1> Reif and I where just wondering around our jungle trying to assist if we happened to be near
