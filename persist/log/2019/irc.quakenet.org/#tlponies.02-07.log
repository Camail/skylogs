20:02:19 <Runbunny> Yeah.
20:02:33 <Camail> luckily i am 100% sick of that mission
20:02:51 <Camail> despite not having like 4 or 5 important ones
20:02:57 <Camail> god damn thats such a shitty design
20:03:18 <Camail> hey lets hide an ENTIRE PART OF A MOVE LIST behind a deco
20:03:24 <Camail> like what
20:03:28 <Runbunny> O:
20:03:31 <Runbunny> What is that?
20:04:14 <Camail> mighty bow
20:04:31 <Camail> it gives bow an extra charge level which changes the combos completely
20:05:18 <Runbunny> Heh.
20:05:22 <Runbunny> Silly bows.
20:05:39 <Camail> bow is the coolest looking ranged weapon
20:05:53 <Camail> and has better range than both
20:06:10 <Camail> i just dont have any of the decos for it so i dont feel like learning it
20:06:22 <Camail> when AT KT comes out i'm gonna learn it tho
20:06:42 <Camail> its also fun because you cant use max might so the builds look really different from everything else

20:11:13 <Runbunny> I saw a video of a guy just dodging around.
20:11:20 <Runbunny> You have a ton of mobility apparently.
20:12:42 <Runbunny> There is still a hunting horn I would like from KT, but she isn't cooperating.
20:15:06 <Rawr|Fone> Try asking nicely runbun
20:16:07 <Runbunny> I rudely destroys her dress.
20:16:18 <Runbunny> then claps her in the face.
20:16:28 <Runbunny> Until her horns fall off.
20:18:24 <Camail> dont make it weird runbun
20:22:24 <Runbunny> I scoop up all the pieces of the dress.
20:22:36 <Camail> even now?
20:22:45 <Camail> i dont even carve the first horns at this point
20:22:54 <Runbunny> I do mostly take the stuff that give research points.
20:23:18 <Camail> runbun you should get the mod that highlights the mats on the ground
20:23:28 <Camail> i got a few days ago, its great
20:23:32 <Runbunny> First horns can give dissolved weapon.
20:23:54 <Runbunny> The chipped gold mass thingy.
20:24:09 <Camail> those are garbage tho
20:24:19 <Camail> dont even know if they can drop r7
20:24:23 <Runbunny> O:
20:24:24 <Camail> let alone r8
20:24:38 <Camail> melded are barely worth picking up, sublimated are the best
20:25:38 <Runbunny> :nocheese:
20:26:17 <Camail> i dont know what that means
20:26:25 <Runbunny> https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/000/388/icon.jpg
20:26:30 <Runbunny> That thing.
20:27:02 <Camail> that doesn't even help
20:27:46 <Runbunny> This should explain https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGWn4cnJXU4
20:29:03 <Camail> it doesn't
20:29:37 <Runbunny> Try number 2 then.
20:29:50 <Camail> i can see the pattern
20:30:24 <Camail> but i dont think i will dig deeper
20:37:05 <Camail> Runbunny  the way AT KT works is kinda weird, and i respect it but i hate it
20:37:31 <Camail> you have the normal reward boxes, but there are rainbow boxes you get as additional rewards depending on what you do in the fight
20:37:59 <Camail> breaking horns while she's furied gets 2 boxes, clearing in p1 gets 2 boxes, breaking the tail gets 1
20:38:41 <Camail> i think i'm gonna have to join a discord just to do it freestyle, and i dont think i'll ever do a scripted p1 clear, just too tight
20:39:09 <Camail> but fuck man, all that work just for slightly different weapons that you might have a chance of getting? fuuuuuck that
20:40:36 <Runbunny> O:
20:40:49 <Runbunny> That sounds weird.
20:40:56 <Camail> there's a cool bomb strat that people are using
20:41:24 <Runbunny> So you can't do sleep strats in p4?
20:41:50 <Camail> you can, you dont get the p1 award tho
20:42:05 <Camail> also sleeping/stunning/KOing is much harder
20:42:28 <Camail> ever for speedrunners, they only do a ko>para>ko string because the threshold is too high
20:42:42 <Runbunny> I see.
20:42:51 <Runbunny> Para is pretty strong.
20:43:04 <Runbunny> I don't understand the clearing in p1 though.
20:43:17 <Camail> well, you bring bombs, and bomb mats
20:43:31 <Runbunny> Don't know what that entails 
20:43:31 <Camail> then shit goes boom, a lot
20:43:57 <Camail> so we know exactly how to release kt, you need to break a certain number of parts
20:44:14 <Camail> what they do is they bomb the parts because epxlosions go through the normal armor
20:44:57 <Camail> also when the sleep kt you can explode bombs as she lands and she doesnt wake up
20:45:05 <Camail> you can get 3 sets of bombs off on a single sleep
20:46:05 <Camail> also lbg mines on the forearms
20:47:07 <Camail> and i think at kt always starts in the same place
20:48:40 <Runbunny> Yeah
20:48:47 <Camail> oh did you just mean my word choice
20:48:50 <Runbunny> I knew about the sleep thing.
20:49:05 <Runbunny> Did that a bit today.
20:49:41 <Camail> you can pretty easily freestyle normal kt
20:50:02 <Runbunny> yeah that is what I am doing.
20:50:10 <Camail> thats all we can hope to do
20:50:14 <Camail> unless you do premades
20:51:14 <Runbunny> That sucks a bit.
20:51:17 <Runbunny> but oh well.
20:51:31 <Runbunny> How much better are Kjarr weapons anyway?
20:51:49 <Camail> not worth it imho
20:52:07 <Camail> like, its a whole new pool of great weapons, so doing it to see what you get is good
20:52:14 <Camail> but grinding for something is just silly
21:09:38 <Runbunny> Grinding for salt.

23:04:55 <Zounds> ey no werk for me tomorrow
23:04:58 <Zounds> \o.
23:05:00 <Zounds> \o/
23:05:18 <Zounds> alas work on saturday and sunday but that's over a whole day from now
23:05:31 <Runbunny> Ey!
23:05:56 <Zounds> gonna have to deal with filty irishmen on saturday
23:06:00 <Zounds> Scotland vs Ireland in the rugby
23:06:10 <Zounds> filthy irishmen*
23:06:22 <Zounds> cold hands are destroying my already poor typing accuracy
23:08:27 <Runbunny> Dang
23:08:38 <Runbunny> You have to deal with both Irishmen and Scots.
23:09:10 <Camail> runbun go to sleep?
23:09:28 <Camail> your almost awake for worst mon
23:10:02 <Zounds> Rugby crowds are decent to work with though
23:10:11 <Zounds> Much calmer and more well behaved than football ones
23:10:30 <Zounds> They're even allowed alcohol in the stands and they don't cause problems most of the time
23:11:10 <Zounds> they even applaud the opponent when they score a try
23:11:38 <Zounds> meanwhile in football two shitheap teams from shitheap towns will have some blood rivalry with each other and boo the opponent any chance they get
23:12:48 <Zounds> Their overpaid prima donnas are the superior ones
23:16:58 <Zounds> anyway, bye for now pons
23:17:19 <Runbunny> Well I finished the book I was reading while I was on the toilet so now I don't want to go to bed.
23:18:46 <Camail> >_>
23:19:11 <Runbunny> I am doing the no cheese face.
