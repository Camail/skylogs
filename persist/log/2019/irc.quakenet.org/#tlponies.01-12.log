01:36:47 <Camail> i've never even tried before, my other attempts were me fumbling around trying to get the emote to even come out
01:37:13 <Runbunny> Does the emote actually work?
01:40:58 <Camail> yea, thats the only way to do it

19:46:31 <DuB`> :P
19:48:03 <Camail> skram wow
19:48:17 <Camail> nice job playing the shoot bangs
19:49:11 <Camail> Runbunny support lbg is pretty fun, especially against normal monsters
19:49:18 <Camail> paralyzing all day
19:58:25 <Runbunny> Shooting dudes with buffs to make them stronger.
20:15:15 <Camail> making those bullets isn't easy, i might do that on ATs but never below
20:15:32 <Camail> slowly building my other stockpiles...
20:17:31 <Camail> twice now tho, i have slept a monster and people kept fighting
20:17:48 <Camail> just gott apay attention tot he music, mates
20:18:05 <Camail> i am 100% playing this build if more tlp plays, tho
20:19:48 <Runbunny> Yeah, nothing like a monster failing asleep and some longsword guy is just like "look at my deeps!"
20:20:19 <Dot> them deepa tohugh bun
20:20:22 <Dot> deeps*
20:20:31 <Runbunny> Also, people planting bombs when a monster is knocked down, blowing back everyone hitting the head.
20:21:00 <Runbunny> But mega barrel bombs Dot.
20:27:04 <Runbunny> You put bombs on the face of sleeping monsters Dot.
20:27:18 <Runbunny> Blown them all the way back to the old world.
20:28:00 <carcinization> barrel bombs bun? i hope you're not a secret international war criminal!
20:29:43 <Runbunny> Just a blood crazed hunter. Using a poison gunlance and all.
20:30:03 <Camail> barrel bombs on a KOd monster are fine if its KT
20:30:12 <Camail> but nothing else
20:31:00 <Runbunny> It's annoying though. Like a gun lance using wyvern fire on an knocked down monster. 
20:31:17 <Runbunny> No one else gets to attack, but you do 300~ damage.
20:32:53 <Camail> it only takes a second to get back into it
20:33:07 <Camail> and kt takes double damage, so its just better
20:33:18 <Camail> if everyone does it, they dont explode
20:40:04 <Runbunny> But this was like a Ratholos.
20:40:42 <Camail> yea...look at my statement?
20:40:53 <Camail> i said its fine to do on kt but nothing else
20:48:10 <Runbunny> Share my frustrations Camail!
20:48:36 <Camail> i'm only mad at people who dont recognize sleep
20:48:48 <Camail> but even then, everyone else is basically new
