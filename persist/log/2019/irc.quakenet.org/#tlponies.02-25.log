22:40:52 <BioPhone> I'm still on site for until Tuesday night
22:43:43 <Camail> skram Dot  apex?
22:45:01 <Dot> i should have gone to bed 40 minutes ago
22:45:30 <CockRoach|42> carcinization: yeah, i should probably have done that too
22:47:06 <Runbunny> It's alright Dot.
22:47:07 <carcinization> well now you have learned for next time :D
22:47:26 <Dot> is it though runbun?
22:47:51 <Runbunny> You can do anything you want buddy.
22:47:55 <carcinization> in the grand scheme of things it probably is dot
22:48:09 <Runbunny> There might be consequences but you can do anything you want.
22:48:28 <Runbunny> Also listen to Reif.
22:48:50 <Dot> reif, thats what my mom said about me forgetting the hob on all last night
22:49:06 <Dot> in the grand scheme it probably wont really have an effect
22:49:14 <carcinization> you should always listen to your mom
22:49:23 <carcinization> especially when she agrees with me
22:49:36 <Runbunny> Hob!
22:49:47 <Runbunny> 4th game is bloodborne.
22:49:55 <Runbunny> but demon's souls is done.
22:50:01 <Dot> poor hob, he hates himself
22:50:12 <carcinization> is he doing random order now?
22:50:21 <Dot> going to die to boss at end of DS2, the ultimate shame
22:52:14 <Runbunny> He always did random order. 
22:52:22 <skram> Camail i to wake up in like 5 hours but i could do a few if we have another frend
22:52:32 <Camail> you fucks should go to sleep
22:52:33 <Camail> jesus
22:52:49 <Camail> all you euros are the worst
22:52:57 <Runbunny> but I think he's going to start with demon's souls more, since it has been troubling him.
22:52:59 <skram> if i wanna be a sleep deprived piece of shit thats my choice, dad
22:53:00 <carcinization> oh dear runbun that shows how aware i am...
22:53:23 <Camail> your choices suck, son
22:53:42 <skram> eh
22:53:44 <skram> too bad
22:53:49 <carcinization> it's not even 11pm here yet
22:53:50 <Runbunny> That train trip really took it out of Camail.
22:54:03 <Camail> it was 75 minutes long, which sucked
22:54:16 <skram> trains are neat tho
22:54:27 <Camail> maybe for the first few years
22:54:38 <Camail> now they're just long cars
22:54:50 <Runbunny> I am all for bullying Skram, but I like it more when I am doing it.
22:55:13 <Camail> i'm bullying him for a good cause
22:56:08 <skram> cant imagine you championing a good cause tbh
22:56:14 <Camail> runbun i'm trying god eater 3, gonna see if its good
22:57:08 <Runbunny> I haven't looked into it much. Is it like Devil may cry?
22:57:39 <Camail> i heard its like monhun
22:57:47 <Camail> anime monhun
22:57:56 <Camail> if it's good i might even buy it
22:58:03 <Runbunny> monhun is already anime O:
22:58:34 <Camail> it's very western artistically 
22:59:12 <Camail> GE3 is some weeb trash
22:59:17 <Runbunny> Oh
22:59:27 <Runbunny> Colour me intrigued.
22:59:44 <Camail> the pirate has multiplayer, apparently
23:00:03 <Camail> but like i said, gonna demo it to form an opinion
23:09:37 <BioPhone> Neigh
23:18:47 <BioPhone> Cam there was a smash tourney in Detroit last weekend. If I wasn't on trip, I woulda gone to my first fg tournament
23:18:56 <Camail> so close
23:19:08 <Camail> well there's always next time
23:19:53 <Camail> Runbunny  holy shit this intro is just an OP
23:19:56 <Camail> its so anime
23:20:57 <Runbunny> lel
23:21:04 <Runbunny> Like tales I guess?
23:21:13 <Camail> no its an animated opening
23:21:21 <Camail> well
23:21:24 <Camail> i dunnow hat tales is
23:21:40 <Camail> never played a tales game
23:23:24 <Runbunny> The game has an OP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViQbt0vxn1A
23:23:38 <Runbunny> Literally the same as the anime, as far as I know.
23:28:17 <Camail> yea basically like that
23:28:55 <Camail> they seem to be using the generic anime 3d engine but the models looks cool, just on the character creation screen
23:29:15 <Camail> the default is white hair so that's like half my job done already
23:29:29 <Camail> if i ever play a character without white hair you know someone stole my computer
23:31:08 <Runbunny> Heh.
23:36:05 <Camail> they let you change your anime iris texture
23:36:17 <Camail> this is such a weeb hole and i hate that it's important to me
