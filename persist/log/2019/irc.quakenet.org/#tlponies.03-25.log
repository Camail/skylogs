19:11:13 <DuB`> Paper about a business ethical dilemma
19:11:31 <Camail> dont steal
19:11:33 <Camail> pet dogs
19:11:35 <Camail> EZ paper
19:11:38 <DuB`> For CPA-required accounting ethics course
19:11:41 <DuB`> Ya srs
19:12:53 <Camail> for real tho, i can only assume the class is about how to not be a bad person
19:13:19 <DuB`> Sorta ye
19:13:32 <Camail> like, i don't think studying ethics is relevant enough to be required unless you are just trying to prevent white collar crimes
19:13:41 <Camail> in which case, wear a different color collar
19:14:04 <Camail> or like, whistleblower protection
19:14:49 <DuB`> For public accounting it's honestly more about independence and not being influence-able rather than good/bad
19:15:31 <Camail> being impartial is important
19:15:35 <Camail> unless i ask you for something
19:15:39 <Camail> then you should give me thing
19:16:02 <DuB`> ;D
19:18:20 <reification> i was told by a lawyer that accounting has much harder ethical standards than lawyering :O
19:19:03 <DuB`> Evere since Enron
19:22:50 <Camail> yea it's way easier to ruin peoples lives as an accountant
19:23:19 <Camail> you have to be a high profile lawyer working on landmark cases if you want to hurt a lot of people
19:24:12 <Camail> Enron was such a wild time
19:24:22 <Camail> i was too young to really understand but still it felt so huge
19:24:57 <Camail> i cant believe dub is responsible for all those black outs in california
19:25:01 <Camail> no wonder he has to write a paper
19:25:06 <DuB`> lul
19:25:11 <Camail> any public apology would be good at this point
19:25:23 <DuB`> The whole "public trust" thing is kinda the point of the whole profession, so yeah. Ethics!
19:25:39 <DuB`> Bit different for me going into tax and not actual audit etc, but still

22:05:35 <skram> Been thinkin bout makin redcurrant wine in the fall
22:05:38 <skram> need me a project
22:05:50 <Crisium> AYAYA
22:09:02 <Zounds> Crisium you still wanna plej
22:09:43 <Camail> fermentation is a good hobby, does currant wine take long
22:09:55 <Camail> because you might want to start with something that only takes like 3 weeks to finish
22:10:34 <Bio> I've still got my brewing shit, I should make a beer
22:10:52 <skram> bout 20 days or so cam
22:11:06 <Camail> that's a good timeline
22:11:33 <Camail> lets you learn, because you dont forget everything you did by the time you get to taste
22:11:47 <skram> Ive done a few beers before
22:12:00 <skram> but winemaking is pretty different a few ways
22:12:00 <Camail> oh, you already have it
22:12:22 <Camail> though i suppose i should assume every male between 25-35 has a fuckin setup
22:12:31 <skram> not anymore lol
22:12:59 <Camail> microbrews are still very popular in the us
22:12:59 <skram> point is that my parents has a bunch of fruit trees and stuff that just rots and i wanted to use it for something
22:13:06 <Camail> throw them at dot
22:13:29 <skram> he is too far away
22:13:35 <Camail> i thought wine was much more hands off than beer
22:13:43 <Camail> at least in my experience
22:14:22 <Crisium> sire Zounds kun
22:14:26 <Crisium> ill plej
22:14:31 <skram> well once you make the wort and start the fermenting its kinda mostly done, you just take it out and put it on bottles and then secondary fermentation/maturing
22:14:37 <Zounds> nice
22:14:41 <skram> with wine you have to air it out or something
22:14:51 <skram> i have no idea, im sure theres like recipes and stuff
22:16:21 <Camail> well, guess it starts with research
22:16:34 <Camail> Dot you should ask skram if he wants to play game
22:16:36 <skram> yup
22:16:39 <Camail> he intimidates me
22:16:45 <Dot> its too late now :/
22:16:49 <Camail> rip
22:16:50 <Dot> i was hoping to play earlier
22:16:56 <Dot> have to sleep soon
22:17:06 <skram> its still 4-5 months before harvesting can be done anyway
22:17:19 <skram> i think im gonna ditch the scion and do the spider lady instead actually
22:18:02 <Camail> you can just play your old character and it will lower your level
22:18:08 <Camail> so you already have the gems
22:19:24 <skram> yeah
22:20:08 <Bio> Its'a me... MARIOOOOO

22:43:36 <Camail> my build starts out as a stormbrand build, then transitions into winter orb
22:44:10 <Camail> that's optimal for speed, but i dont really care about that so i think i wont commit my passives to brand stuff
22:44:37 <Camail> we'll get to 28 soon and once we get to 31 all my gems are available
22:45:18 <Camail> also Dot if you need gems that your class cant get i can buy them for you from the end game vendor
22:54:15 <Dot> classes cant all buy the same items?

23:13:40 <Camail> the gems you can buy have slight variations per class
23:14:03 <Camail> some people will start 2 characters at the beginning of the league to transfer gems
23:14:15 <Camail> every other item is unrestricted, tho
23:19:50 <Camail> so if the gem vendor doesn't have a gem that your build wants, but your passed the minimum level already, then your class cant get it
23:20:00 <Camail> like herald of agony for witch
23:28:20 <DoT|Phone1> wait what. you can just not be able to buy it after a certain lvl?
23:28:27 <DoT|Phone1> sounds bad
23:29:00 <Camail> well you cant buy it at all if you haven't unlocked it

23:29:05 <Camail> i think you misunderstood
23:29:53 <Camail> they try not to throw every gem in the game at you right away, so they let you get them from vendors and quests
23:30:34 <Camail> but each class has different sets of gems as options for quest rewards
23:30:50 <Camail> you get one gem for free for completing the quest, and you can buy any of the other ones from the vendor
23:31:44 <Camail> so if you reach a gem's minimum level (also the level that you'd normally be given the option of getting it) and still can't buy it, thne your class doesn't get that skill right away
23:32:10 <Camail> there is a vendor at the end of act 1 that sells every skill gem that you can by at that point, but there are still restrictions
23:32:24 <Camail> at the epilogue you have access to a vendor with every single gem
23:37:50 <Zounds> ggs cris and nn pons
23:39:35 <Camail> nn
