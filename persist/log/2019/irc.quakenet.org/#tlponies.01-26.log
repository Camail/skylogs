22:46:12 <Camail> why is bloodborne last
22:46:21 <Camail> aren't the bosses super fast and rng
22:47:08 <Runbunny> Nah, well a bit. but they aren't super RNG.
22:47:18 <Runbunny> I think the very heavy RNG boss is skipped.
22:47:50 <Camail> jesus
22:47:55 <Camail> why do people watch this
22:47:59 <Camail> its too stressful
22:48:19 <Runbunny> Indeed. But there is Hob to hold your dick through the journey.
22:48:34 <Camail> ok i get why YOU watch
22:49:18 <Camail> so is doing dancer early just too hard
22:51:04 <Runbunny> Yeah, well I guess there is no point to it. 
22:51:32 <Runbunny> Might as well do it later when they fight is shorter.
22:53:11 <Camail> longsword is fun
22:53:24 <Camail> havent quite got the counter down
22:53:43 <Camail> ended a p6 kt run with a jump slash to the horns, which looked cool
22:55:42 <Runbunny> Are you styudying the blade?
22:57:12 <Camail> just swinging it a lot
22:58:33 <Runbunny> I want to try great sword with focus decorations.
23:01:33 <Camail> meh, you dont need the meter gain buff, imo
23:04:17 <Runbunny> I mean great sword has no meter. It's for faster charge attacks.

23:43:20 <Camail> pick up all the decos until it starts to leave, flash and repeat until it empties its stomach, then leave the quest
23:43:33 <Camail> i just got 20 decos in 5 minutes

23:50:01 <Camail> god damn
23:51:23 <Camail> if you dont hit it, you can bait the vomit attack way more
23:51:29 <Camail> just stand in front of it, maybe a bit to the side
23:51:35 <Camail> so you can try to avoid baiting the charge
