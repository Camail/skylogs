12:39:54 <skram> make him do a barbarian
12:40:37 <DoT|Phone> but they are the worst
12:40:53 <skram> ?!
12:40:56 <skram> how DARE you

12:41:26 <BioPhone> Hey
12:41:30 <BioPhone> Morn
12:41:33 <skram> thats the funny bit, zounds
12:41:39 <skram> heio bio
12:41:45 <DoT|Phone> bio
12:41:54 <DoT|Phone> I'm going to guess fighter
12:42:19 <skram> make him be a cleric
12:42:30 <skram> only mormon in all of faerun
12:43:03 <DoT|Phone> we have a druid who heals. so your ok for that. but maybe he would like fighty cleric
12:43:16 <DoT|Phone> clerics ARE the best and most versatile
12:43:27 <skram> yeah clerics are great
12:43:39 <skram> especially if you get toll of the dead
12:43:54 <DoT|Phone> finger guns, pew pew
12:44:07 <skram> hellz yeah
12:45:16 <DoT|Phone> you better hope he picks something fighty because lone front line monk will not go well
12:45:27 <skram> thats probably true
12:46:18 <DoT|Phone> monks are hit and run and get into the back lines kind of fighters. at low levels at least
12:46:46 <skram> im a tank monk
12:46:55 <skram> give me full plate p l s
12:47:01 <DoT|Phone> k
12:48:26 <BioPhone> I could play front lines sorc
12:48:34 <BioPhone> Tank for all of 2 attacks
12:48:49 <BioPhone> Maybe
12:49:19 <skram> nice
12:56:28 <DoT|Phone> there are a lot of options. ranger with animal, paladin, fighter, cleric, moon druid, hexblade warlock
12:56:44 <DoT|Phone> off the top of my head
13:00:06 <DoT|Phone> but maybe he wants to play a wizard. then he plays a wizard.
13:00:44 <BioPhone> Who knows!
13:01:03 <DoT|Phone> !
13:06:13 <skram> no wizards allowed
13:07:41 <DoT|Phone> no dwarves either. your actually an oversized halfling
13:08:20 <skram> unacceptable
13:10:51 <BioPhone> More maymays in disc
13:11:16 <skram> i dont like maymays
13:11:56 <DoT|Phone> also I am more than capable of rolling 2 1's in a row

19:12:10 <BioPhone> Purge with fire imo
19:12:39 <skram> whos getting purged
19:13:17 <Camail> you
19:14:23 <skram> its finally happening
19:14:29 <Camail> hmm, people are angry at patreon and i dont understand
19:14:35 <Camail> i think it's because change is scary
19:16:18 <Camail> breaking news: business that is hemorrhaging money needs to make more money
19:16:37 <Camail> and everyone is grandfathered into their old contracts anyway!
19:17:17 <skram> whats changed though
19:17:22 <skram> patreon takes a bigger cut?
19:22:27 <Camail> form 5% to 8% for their standard service
19:22:39 <Camail> with a 5% option with fewer functions, and a 12% premiuim tier
19:23:45 <reification> prob because there's no good reason for them not to be hugely profitable already
19:24:21 <reification> they just took a bunch of investor money and got the problems that came with it
19:26:46 <Camail> can you explain what they're wasting their money on
19:26:57 <reification> they are hugely overstaffed
19:27:26 <Camail> like, the dev staff?
19:27:26 <reification> which is very expensive given location
19:28:06 <Dot> skram
19:29:08 <Camail> i've never been convinced by the "if everything stays small they can be more fiscally flexible" kinda perspective
19:30:05 <Camail> unless the overstaffing is in superfluous areas
19:31:02 <Camail> but if it's more people working on features and big data analysis and stuff, cool.
19:31:35 <reification> sadly i can't find the info i saw before
19:32:11 <Camail> do you remember general bits of it
19:32:22 <reification> they are running a payment processor and very basic site. it should be wildly profitable at the current rates
19:32:52 <Camail> thats...thats not all they need
19:32:56 <reification> iirc processing $500m this year
19:33:19 <Camail> if they literally never want to change or grow at all, then maybe thats all you need
19:33:22 <reification> a few hundred employees
19:33:35 <reification> they have been growing wildly with just that
19:33:50 <Camail> business, marketing, R&D?
19:34:57 <reification> true there are other costs 
19:35:06 <Camail> i don't think its right to simplify their business strategy to just tech maintenance
19:35:16 <reification> but they are in a huge network advantage situation
19:35:33 <reification> it would be like microsoft losing money on windows
19:36:12 <reification> maybe they will come up with some amazing new thing and i will eat my words
19:37:10 <Camail> even if they don't, they are offering an option for people who want none of the new features
19:37:33 <Camail> if you just want a payment processing hub, you can still get that for 5%
19:38:02 <Camail> and even for the next few weeks you can get all the normal features for 5%
19:38:17 <reification> tbf i quit using them over the last fee raise they tried then abandoned after botching it
19:40:39 <Camail> businesses in america are encouraged to always be growing, it's an all consuming culture
19:41:08 <Camail> i don't believe it should be that way tho, i don't personally like it
19:41:32 <Camail> nor does that count as an excuse for any potential bullshit they do
19:42:04 <Camail> but in this particular case, it really seems like they are trying to be as consumer friendly as possible while also being told to increase their cut
19:42:54 <reification> growth is fine, the difference is organic growth vs taking outside money 
19:44:37 <Camail> It gets a bit too complicated for my current level of understanding
19:45:19 <Camail> because if you dislike investors for destabilizing a business, then there are a lot of factors that determine if that's actually what is happening
19:45:53 <Camail> and i don't have a grasp on whether or not patreon, or any business, would be fine without investors
19:46:45 <Camail> I know that an influx of money can cause rampant scope problems, but increasing your scope is not inherently bad or destabilizing. I just don't know where the line is.
