00:14:11 <Camail> ded
00:16:27 <Camail> oh dang Runbunny i didnt realize the abyssal lich was a rare fight
00:16:44 <Camail> i got it on my first and only one
00:18:13 <Camail> ah fuck i could've got shroud from him, bummer
00:18:26 <Camail> got darkness enthroned and tombfist
00:41:16 <Runbunny> I think the gloves are pretty good, if they roll nice.
00:44:54 <Camail> there's only one modifier that has a roll
00:45:07 <Camail> and its 4-6% max life
00:45:52 <Runbunny> I think it can roll one or two abyssal sockets as well.
00:46:30 <Runbunny> Maybe I am thinking of a different item.
00:47:21 <Camail> must be
00:47:59 <Camail> both uniques i got are worth 1c each

13:59:20 <Runbunny> reification, I haven't watched/read Komi-san. Also that cat has loli sleeves.
14:17:34 <skram> anders whats a loli sleeve
14:18:53 <Runbunny> You know.
14:19:19 <skram> i dont
14:20:24 <Runbunny> Like imagine a loli at school. It's early spring, so it's a bit chilly in the morning, so as a part of the regular school uniform an cardigan for added warmth.
14:20:47 <Runbunny> However, the sleeves are a bit long since well it's a loli.
14:20:53 <Runbunny> so it's loli sleeves.
14:21:02 <Runbunny> because they are too long.
14:23:09 <Runbunny> Do you need images or are you set?
14:30:43 <skram> i think i understand, runbun
14:32:31 <DoT|Phone> this worries me, most of my sleeves are too long
