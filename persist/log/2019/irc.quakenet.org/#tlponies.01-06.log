00:32:23 <Bio> dragons!
00:32:25 <Bio> dungeons
00:32:31 <Bio> I HAVE THEM BOTH
00:36:20 <DuB`> :D
00:36:35 <DuB`> Both shall fall before my 4d6 sneak attacks.
00:36:45 <Dot> so many d's
00:37:12 <skram> giggidy
00:38:28 <DuB`> 41 max damage per turn without crits
00:38:32 <DuB`> p gud p gud
00:42:29 <Phearlock> There dot, I have posted the map you wanted
00:42:49 <Phearlock> In all its fastest-I-could-sketch glory
00:43:08 <DuB`> :D
00:43:33 <Camail> they really buffed rogues with the ally-adjacent sneak attacks
00:43:37 <Camail> it's kinda nutty
00:45:47 <Dot> oh nice map
00:46:02 <Phearlock> It's ok dub keeps dropping his bow instead of bonus action disengaging. And then engaging an enemy in melee range by himself Camail.
00:46:15 <Phearlock> So he just nerfs himself
00:46:22 <Phearlock> Lets us look good
00:46:31 <Dot> such a nice friend
00:46:55 <Dot> is that "elevated area" or elevator area phear
00:47:09 <Phearlock> Elevated
00:47:13 <Dot> aww
00:47:16 <Phearlock> It's higher up than the loot area
00:47:22 <Dot> this place needs a dragon elevator
00:47:26 <Phearlock> Dragon = loot area
00:50:38 <DuB`> I would like a loot
00:51:08 <Phearlock> There is a little tunnel behind the dragon that you can sneak attack from dub
00:51:14 <Phearlock> with your 4d6 I'm sure you can oneshot it
00:51:24 <Phearlock> I'll watch
00:51:42 <Dot> skram, you got your nets ready?
00:52:12 <skram> obviously
00:52:20 <skram> got my pimp hand cocked too
00:53:35 <Bio> I do hope its a big net
00:54:23 <Dot> how big was the dragon ?
00:54:56 <Bio> v large
00:55:03 <Bio> he's an absolute U N I T
00:55:08 <Dot> thats no a dnd size
00:55:30 <Phearlock> Big boi
00:55:40 <Bio> I would consider him of Huge size
00:55:50 <Phearlock> Bio helpfully identified him as a male too so we don't have to assume its gender
00:55:56 <Dot> like this boi bio https://i.redd.it/8xbflara90821.jpg
00:56:15 <skram> please use this chart https://i.imgur.com/g1DE1Xt.png

21:23:32 <Cane> Alright, old GPU installed and working.
21:25:10 <Dot> gl
21:25:30 <Cane> So far so good. I'm surprised by how well games are running so far considering how old it is.
21:26:06 <skram> what is it canester
21:29:43 <skram> I've been troubleshooting weird sound glitches for a while now and ive found out two things: Integrated soundcard gives weird stutters at random intervals, if I route sound through my Vive I dont get stutters but LR channels are reversed
21:30:12 <skram> I dont know which is more of a hassle, to put my headset on backwards while gaming or having my music interrupted
21:31:50 <skram> I have an external sound card that i sometimes use that gives the same stutters
21:54:06 <Dot> skram, stop having your stuff break
21:55:04 <Cane> It's a Sapphire HD 7870. Old card by now but apparently still good.
21:55:14 <Cane> My GTX 980 Ti is dying so I'm RMAing that in tomorrow.
22:15:55 <Bio> neigh
22:18:25 <Camail> i want a separate agdq channel for just the runs, and none of the donations
22:18:49 <Dot> but cam, they are from germany!
22:19:23 <Camail> but its stuuuupid
22:19:35 <skram> rude
22:19:58 <Camail> a little
22:20:16 <Camail> none of the other charity streams read donations anymore, for a reason
22:20:59 <skram> is there an awful games block this year
22:21:00 <Camail> there's probably only one or two people on the org that want to keep them for tradition's sake
22:21:11 <Camail> i dont know, but i am sure there is
22:21:17 <Camail> there's always one
22:21:25 <Crisium> stop being a radical cam
22:21:27 <skram> it was last years highlight for me honestly
22:21:58 <Camail> agdq golden years were before they went to this venue
22:22:19 <Crisium> stop being a traditionalist glorifying the past cam
22:22:32 <Camail> but when the past is 4 years ago!
22:23:36 <Dot> cam, i do think they should limit it to larger donataion, but oh well
22:24:10 <Dot> reading out only larger donations*
22:25:03 <skram> i think they do that already
22:25:15 <Camail> there was one for $20 earlier
22:25:34 <Camail> they might have a lower bound
22:50:17 <Runbunny> Camail, wasn't it like that a few years ago?
22:50:22 <Runbunny> I recall it being like that.
