18:23:37 <skrm> oh ok
18:23:47 <Runbunny> Ladders :D
18:24:09 <Camail> astralis are probably gonna win this map
18:24:15 <Camail> they are seriously outplaying ence
18:24:25 <Camail> both in aim and positioning
18:24:32 <Runbunny> It is CT side Train though.
18:26:37 <Camail> yea but the way they're playing
18:26:52 <Camail> the quality of play is just stupidly high
18:27:14 <Runbunny> A Staple of the Danish lads.
18:27:22 <Runbunny> Suck it rest of the world.
18:27:30 <skrm> dev1ce is the best csgo player of all time
18:27:31 <skrm> change my mind
18:27:37 <Camail> hopefully ence change their strats
18:27:53 <Camail> because the rifle rounds were kinda meh

18:29:18 <Runbunny> Hai.
18:29:38 <Phearlock> hey Micen
18:31:13 <skrm> howdy moocen
18:35:23 <Camail> i thought ence would have a chance because they're new
18:35:25 <Camail> guess not
18:36:27 <Runbunny> Train is rough though.

18:38:53 <Runbunny> If Astralis gets the pistol it's rough for ENCE.
18:39:04 <Runbunny> Inferno might be a different story.
18:39:35 <Camail> ence picked train
18:40:03 <Runbunny> Yeah, that meant Astralis could start as CT.
18:40:49 <Camail> yea, just saying that if astralis wins ence's map pick, woof
18:40:59 <Camail> it's their best chance to win a map
18:41:11 <Runbunny> Mayhaps.
18:41:21 <Runbunny> Maybe I just don't like train :/
18:41:25 <Runbunny> Can't win on that map.
18:41:30 <Camail> i mean, teams usually try and pick their best maps
18:41:33 <Camail> i love train
18:41:36 <Runbunny> no one can.
18:41:42 <Runbunny> Everyone loses.
18:41:45 <Camail> someone has to win each time run
18:41:53 <Camail> they dont all end in draws

19:35:31 <Zounds> Was fine till the end then flares and seats being thrown
19:35:32 <Dot> HAHAHA
19:35:46 <Dot> thats a solid throw
19:35:57 <Camail> skrm i believe they lowered the price of the aug to force everyone to learn how to use it, so they can change the price back after the major
19:36:08 <Camail> it's not a rumor
19:36:12 <Camail> but thats just waht i think
19:36:28 <skrm> what purpose would that serve though
19:36:37 <Camail> ?
19:36:48 <Zounds> Runbunny: Scottish twitter is just Scottish people
19:36:52 <Camail> they make people learn it so they know tis a viable pick for certain situations
19:37:02 <Zounds> And I'd love a collab between scotspeople and pokémon
19:37:06 <Runbunny> :D
19:37:17 <Camail> but right now there is no downside
19:37:37 <skrm> do you think there'd be any situations where you'd want an aug despite the cost?
19:37:55 <Camail> yes
19:38:00 <Camail> ironically, for holding closer angles
19:38:08 <Camail> because it can 1 shot
19:38:15 <Camail> or very long distances for the scope
19:39:16 <Camail> it absolutely shouldn't stay the current price, it goes against every other balance change they've made
19:40:40 <skrm> what was the price pre-change?
19:40:45 <skrm> 3900?
19:40:49 <Runbunny> no no
19:41:01 <Runbunny> 3300 I think.
19:41:02 <Camail> it was 300 more than the m4
19:41:05 <Camail> or 200
19:42:30 <skrm> damn i thought the change was greater
19:42:35 <skrm> that seems like a very small change
19:42:51 <Runbunny> That's the thing
19:43:03 <Runbunny> It was only a minor change.
19:43:08 <Camail> aug is a good anchor gun
19:43:16 <Bio> 16-0?
19:43:25 <Bio> hope not
19:43:28 <Camail> i dont think it was a minor change
19:43:33 <Zounds> https://i.imgur.com/EgfcqSD.jpg
19:43:52 <Camail> the price adds up
19:44:03 <skrm> well sure
19:44:12 <Camail> the a1s was way better than the m4 because it was cheaper
19:44:16 <Runbunny> Zounds, :D
19:44:43 <Camail> if you used to buy AUG for an entire half, that's like 2 entire nade sets you aren't getting
19:44:59 <Camail> thats huge at the competitive level
19:45:12 <Camail> and the pros are the people who put the work into finding out which guns are good
19:45:22 <Camail> they needs to give the pros a reason to put the man hours into the aug
19:46:02 <Camail> and now we know there are roles where the aug is worth it even at a higher price
19:46:22 <Runbunny> Camail did you watch 3kliksphilips video about the aug?
19:46:46 <Camail> the first few minutes, but i didn't really enjoy it
19:47:01 <Camail> 1 ROUND
19:47:03 <Camail> WOO
19:47:11 <Runbunny> He makes a good point though.
19:47:32 <Camail> against the people who were blindly following convention, yea
19:48:36 <Camail> it didn't really interact with any of my beliefs
19:52:31 <Camail> ugh, haven't even been watching the GF
19:53:02 <Bio> bit of a stomp game 2
