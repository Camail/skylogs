00:53:40 <Camail> i dunno if i want to play it
00:53:58 <Camail> if i do, i gotta stop playing pretty much everything else or my thumb will die
01:02:35 <Runbunny> what do you press with your thumb?
01:04:11 <Camail> i use it instead of lmb
01:04:46 <Camail> because holding down lmb aggravates my rsi more than anything else
