03:21:00 <Camail> the best stuff goes for like 3-4ex, and 1ex=100c
03:21:44 <Camail> and i just bought a belt i really needed for 10c

11:47:47 <Dot> MORT
11:54:09 <Runbunny> I'll argue that Sekiro is not a souls game.
11:54:58 <Runbunny> It's very different. The whole approach is different.
11:55:29 <Runbunny> In souls games you can usually wait around until you get a opening, not so much in Sekiro.
12:24:41 <Dot> runbun, you tihnk hob will be able to no hit it? that grapple thing looks like someone will break the game badly with it
12:28:07 <Runbunny> I think you might be able to super cheese parts of the game. 
12:28:27 <Runbunny> Not sure about bosses though. You need to be a parry god.
12:29:41 <Dot> skrm

21:56:52 <Camail> boy leveling sure does slow down at around 70
21:57:22 <Camail> though, now that i actually understand the map system i can actually progress...
21:57:55 <Camail> and once i get a my 6L we can use my tabula rasa as a weird community shirt
21:58:04 <Camail> where we all share the shirt 
22:00:44 <Camail> or you can buy your own, they are only 10c

22:01:01 <Camail> it's probably the first thing you should buy, i dunno why i farmed my own
22:03:12 <Camail> Runbunny  the regalia i rolled has 155 hp, +71 es, 27 int, and an open affix
22:03:22 <Camail> i just want to be beefy
22:10:49 <Runbunny> Camail, I was wrong before. You can straight up buy 6L from the crafting bench, but it's 1500 fusings. 
22:10:52 <carcinization> bio skram https://twitter.com/Irongear71/status/1109405058020634625
22:11:10 <Runbunny> Average is probably around 900-1000 to 6 link.
22:12:17 <Camail> ah, and you probably need to go way deeper into the maps than i have to get the recipe
22:13:19 <Camail> i'm in no rush, i'm sure i'll get it before i end up getting an upgrade
22:13:30 <Camail> because the upgrades are 4ex
22:14:52 <Camail> you'd think its more economical to buy a crappy 6 link, scour it, and try to roll what you want
22:15:09 <Camail> guess you cant do that with uniques tho
22:15:47 <carcinization> runbun isekai just keeps going https://blog.jlist.com/news/new-promotional-video-revealed-for-do-you-love-your-mom-and-her-two-hit-multi-target-attacks/

22:27:18 <Camail> but at least some of them are good
