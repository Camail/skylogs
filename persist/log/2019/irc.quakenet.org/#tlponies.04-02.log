18:59:55 <DuB`> Then sleepy all the next day :T
19:03:53 <reification> i wouldn't know cause you can't get it without prescription in the uk :/
19:04:30 <reification> i can advise that 5-htp is pretty potent stuff though
19:07:24 <skrm> reif are you a psychonaut
19:07:26 <skrm> doing RCs and stuff
19:09:35 <reification> i don't know what they are but i aim for the least experimental drugs as possible
19:11:13 <skrm> All the drugs in Shulgin's books have names like 2C-B and 5-MeO-DMT so I thought you was tripping balls over there
19:12:09 <reification> that's just cause all drugs have silly long names
19:13:06 <reification> to be fair it does produce very vivid dreams
19:14:32 <skrm> drugs are bad for you, reif
19:14:38 <skrm> have you tried some essential oils instead
19:14:54 <reification> but it is just a serotonin precursor, nothing exciting
