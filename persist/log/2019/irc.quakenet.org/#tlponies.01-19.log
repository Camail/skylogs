01:08:22 <Camail> awesome, found a hexchat script that truncates nicks
01:08:34 <Dot> lol
01:13:00 <skrm> cool beans cml
01:20:41 <Camail> .tell Runbunny extremoth is hard
01:22:26 <Runbunny> I am not surprised.
01:23:56 <Cane> Camail, any other good HexChat scripts? I haven't looked at any of them.
01:25:29 <Dot> runbun you just fixed your sleep schedule
01:27:41 <skrm> its the weekend, Dot 
01:27:57 <Camail> Cane  i haven't either
01:28:08 <Camail> just looked up the feature and the top hit was a python script
01:28:36 <Camail> but it's not really working right...
01:28:57 <Cane> Weak.
01:29:10 <Camail> Runbunny  meteor is basically instant, and is at maximum strength at phase 1, aka one for each party member
01:29:24 <Camail> tornadoes are nearly instantly cast
01:29:44 <Camail> so you cant even run away, maybe you have to react to the message on the side?
01:30:32 <Camail> dunno if he's flashable, i read he wasn't but with such a short cast time i'd hope he still is

01:33:16 <Camail> apparently you really really need a tank
01:33:25 <Camail> which is how you stop tornadoes
01:37:15 <DoT|Phone> Runbun. you think the hob will do it
01:40:11 <Runbunny> Hob will do it.
01:40:29 <DoT|Phone> so far in the fun
01:40:32 <DoT|Phone> run
01:40:37 <Runbunny> Is it time to get a heavy bowgun with a shield?
01:44:08 <Camail> i dunno, i have KT horn hbg which is supposed to be pretty good
01:44:15 <Camail> might mess around with it now
01:50:04 <reification> night all

02:02:28 <Camail> nahhh fuck this boss
02:09:07 <Camail> i couldn't even get the aggro with hbg, was too busy trying to block his 1 millions spells and attacks
02:25:38 <Camail> IG is supposedly a decent tank option as well, might try that
02:38:18 <Runbunny> It's a piece of trash. I couldn't even line of sight the ecliptic meteor, you have to be behind the comet.
02:39:35 <Camail> thats how normal behemoth works  too
02:39:44 <Camail> i was in a camp and got killed by it
02:40:52 <Camail> gotta use the ff14 jump emote if you cant get behind a comet, but that doesnt seem that hard to do
02:41:01 <Camail> the invuln window feels pretty big
02:41:03 <Runbunny> Other people tried the jump emote, but I am not certain if they just failed or if it works.
02:41:06 <Runbunny> oh okay.
02:41:43 <Camail> they must've failed, it's supposedly hard to do
02:42:02 <Camail> but again, my first attempt when i got it off, i actually did it pretty early and had a ton of time in the air
02:43:04 <Runbunny> I should probably bind that to something.
02:44:19 <Camail> i have it on my radial menu
02:44:21 <Camail> but thats on pad
02:44:36 <Camail> i even have it on two slots next to each other so if i flick wrong it still selects it
02:48:11 <Runbunny> It seems to reset my bars from time to time. So it's kinda iffy.
02:50:59 <Camail> i've never had it reset anything other than the ammo bar
02:51:34 <Camail> but the quick select radial menu should never change
