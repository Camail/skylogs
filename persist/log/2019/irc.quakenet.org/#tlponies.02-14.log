15:49:51 <Cane> And the fucking ice cream truck just drove by, music happily bleeting.

21:37:45 <skram> it sort of is
21:38:05 <skram> except maybe the dancing babby thing but who cares
21:39:17 <Crisium> ya it started in 1998
21:39:20 <Crisium> hard to beat that
21:40:06 <Camail> it's hard to distinguish between meme and viral video pre-2010
21:40:27 <Camail> there's a difference but things that would be classified as memes back then didn't have the label yet
21:41:16 <Camail> cuz numa isn't a meme, but i would say dancing baby is because it was so aggressively reused

22:26:32 <DuB`> Sometimes I wonder why I bother picking up anything besides wingman, though :P
22:29:39 <Bio> dot
22:29:44 <Dot> BIO
22:29:48 <Dot> caps
22:29:58 <Bio> i remembered that i lost all my horse pictures when my HD crashed a while back
22:30:00 <Bio> and then i got sad
22:30:01 <Camail> shotguns are really good if you are being pushed
22:30:17 <Camail> being able to pop out and take shots with relatively little risk
22:30:25 <Dot> shotguns are the only thing i seem to hit at all with
22:30:37 <Dot> a guy stodd still and i missed with the sniper...
22:31:23 <Runbunny> I had the golden shotgun twice today Camail.
22:31:23 <Camail> wingman is my favorite midrange gun
22:31:35 <Camail> nice, i haven't used a golden weapon yet in a match
22:31:36 <Dot> they are all waiting on the internet bio
22:31:51 <Runbunny> It's really strong but you only get 20 shots.
22:31:55 <Dot> i had a golden ... peacekeeper i think
22:32:05 <Dot> 5 round burst heavy ammo smg thing
22:32:10 <Camail> there are only two golden weapons
22:32:16 <Camail> shotgun and sniper
22:32:19 <Runbunny> Kraber and Mastiff.
22:32:24 <Dot> it was gold
22:32:30 <Dot> and had all gold attahments
22:32:53 <Camail> must've been shotgun, then, because there are only the two
22:34:29 <Dot> Legendary weapons come in two forms. There are Legendary standard weapons and then there are two Legendary exclusive weapons. Legendary standard weapons are just the normal weapons typically found on Apex Legends‘ map, only with all of their Attachment slots filled with pre-selected “best” attachments. Not all attachments will necessarily be to a player’s liking, and neither will the weapons. Finding a gold Legendary standard weapon early
22:34:29 <Dot>  on can make a huge difference, but mid-to-late game players should stick with their favorites so long as it’s kitted out.
22:34:43 <Dot> thought i was going to get kicked for spam there
22:35:24 <DuB`> I see I see
22:37:47 <Runbunny> Imagine getting the golden Mozambique.
22:38:16 <Dot> i know im bad but i can tell the diffrence between an smg/assualt rifle and a shutgun
22:41:59 <Dot> Prowler, that was it
22:42:10 <skram> the worst gun
22:42:49 <Dot> i find the flatline worse
22:42:59 <Dot> too much kick and most of the time cant see once shooting
22:43:46 <skram> i liked having red point on the triple take
22:44:04 <Dot> i need to use the R-301 more, it seemed nice
22:46:22 <Camail> the SMGs are all fun, but some of them are too slow
22:47:30 <Dot> i always feel like 3 round burst guns should be good at medium range in games
22:47:45 <Dot> but have yet to feel like they work for me
22:48:35 <Camail> its kinda like the wingman
22:48:44 <skram> bursts are hard to get used to imo
22:48:50 <Camail> the one drawback to the wingman is the recoil
22:49:08 <Camail> and burst guns do roughly the same damage, but with less recoil
