16:13:38 <Crisium> im not hatin on nixon, but because he resigned he isnt eligible for presidential celebration
16:13:45 <Crisium> he didnt get a state funeral for example
16:14:23 <skrm> how rude
16:14:33 <skrm> all he did was put up some microphones
16:15:01 <Crisium> whats funny is that he won that election with the biggest landslide ever so he had no reason to cheat
16:16:18 <reification> cheating is often poorly judged tho e.g. 322
16:18:27 <skrm> wasnt there a csgo team that did the same

20:17:32 <Camail> its pretty sad
20:17:39 <Camail> mining bug is a sad
20:17:54 <Camail> every character you meet is pretty sad
20:17:57 <Dot> i feel there is a very deep sadness there, in the world built and the exploration if it
20:18:00 <Dot> but its so good
20:18:23 <Camail> there is a TON of personal strife
20:26:14 <Runbunny> And then there is Zote.
20:28:56 <Zounds> lots of sadness when thought about for more than 2 seconds
20:28:59 <Zounds> you're right
20:29:19 <DuB`> Sounds awful :P
20:29:41 <Camail> Zote is a fuckhead and i hate him

20:35:10 <Runbunny> Haha.
20:35:26 <Runbunny> Did he steal your waifu?
20:36:16 <Camail> no it's a bit more complicated than that
20:36:32 <Camail> my hatred for him is constant
20:36:50 <Camail> my hatred for the other character was at an all time high, then lessened as they had a change of heart
20:53:26 <skrm> hmm
20:58:44 <Camail> skram have oyu ever played it

21:11:12 <Runbunny> Do it Dot.
21:11:17 <Camail> oh right, that's fairly early
21:11:25 <Camail> but the game isn't terribly linear
21:11:51 <Camail> i should say that the sleepers aren't as intimidating as you'd think
21:13:08 <Runbunny> Dude.
21:13:32 <Runbunny> I was afraid.
21:14:12 <Dot> well i went to one once, in my first playthrough, thats where  got to
21:14:20 <Dot> then didnt game anything for a while
21:14:34 <Dot> so when i went back to play i couldnt really recall the story
21:15:13 <Dot> but i tihnk ive explored everywhere thats around before the sleepers
