17:58:23 <Dot> hows you
17:59:50 <Zounds> fairly decent
18:01:39 <Dot> i still picture zounds as that one old pic of him in a kilt, but then your off putting down boisterous football hooligans 
18:02:49 <Zounds> heh I haven't changed too much I still look pretty young for my age
18:02:53 <Zounds> Something you might relate to
18:03:04 <Dot> just a bit :P
18:05:20 <Zounds> I blame pons
18:05:33 <Zounds> they arrested my development and now I'm the eternal manchild
18:07:02 <Dot> dont worry, s9 is the last season and the curse shall break
18:07:33 <Dot> i joke, but knowing its ending is still sad, even though i havnt watched about a season and a half
18:10:48 <Zounds> I've mostly watched the apparent standout episodes in recent times
18:11:24 <Zounds> I don't really like the way americans/canadians run their tv shows tbh
18:11:33 <Zounds> So many different writers revolving all the time
18:12:09 <Zounds> Our way of 6 episodes a millenium that are at least consistent within a season is better :P

21:01:36 <skram> i dont know what that means zounds :(
21:02:20 <skram> oh i had a question regarding scotland earlier but i cant remember what it was
21:03:16 <Dot> they deepfry everything skram
21:04:57 <Zounds> we have a lot of heart disease
21:05:19 <CockRoach|42> .tell Dot https://insta-stalker.com/post/Bt4JOm3nTJt/
21:05:46 <Dot> silly snek
21:07:59 <Dot> https://imgur.com/gallery/NZn7m5s
21:08:20 <Crisium> Dot DuB` i won my first game doing solo after our games lol
21:08:37 <Crisium> carred by a 12 kill 2000+ damage, but i still put out 1200 damage myself
21:08:51 <Dot> we are a heavy weight
21:08:52 <skram> cris why do you refuse to carry the horses
21:08:56 <skram> i thought we was pals
21:10:08 <Crisium> lol i had a crazy scope for my scout
21:10:19 <Crisium> like 6x-10x toggle or something crazy
21:11:09 <skram> apparently the mil-dot things and the ranging stuff on the scopes are accurate with bullet drop
21:11:27 <skram> no idea how that works but its sorta nifty i guess
21:11:37 <Dot> yea skram, but range fights are kinda silly in the game
21:11:47 <Dot> if you cant push a squad they just heal/res
21:11:57 <skram> its true
21:12:04 <Dot> im a bad shot, so no chance of actually doing anything 
21:12:24 <skram> you cant actually one-shot anyone with armor so its kinda useless
21:13:13 <skram> still though
21:13:17 <skram> pew pew from very faar
21:13:19 <skram> very exciting
21:14:46 <Dot> i did knock 2 ppl with a longbow though
21:14:52 <Dot> they where fighting someone else
21:15:15 <skram> thing is, if you stay still and pew pew someone else will run towards said pew pew noises and kill you
21:15:17 <skram> every time
21:16:02 <Dot> yea, got to move a lot, only real need for a sniper is to mayb e slow a squad being forced in your direction 
21:16:54 <skram> its kinda useful if you're trying to hold a stationary position where you cant be flanked
21:17:06 <skram> which only happens in the last stage of the game really
21:22:24 <Dot> what you up up to today skram?
21:23:49 <skram> ive been useless all day dot
21:24:27 <Dot> yes, you where not here
21:24:55 <skram> dad bought a motorcycle, had to go look at it make vroom vroom noises
21:25:11 <Dot> i hope he has a helmet
21:25:47 <skram> he better
21:28:48 <skram> my oldest sister told us that she finally left her piece of shit boyfriend too, so good new all around i think
21:29:07 <Dot> what a day for the skram family
21:30:20 <skram> should make a tv show probably
21:32:08 <Crisium> my dream came true, i killed a whole 3 man squad with 1 clip of devotion
21:32:34 <Dot> are you now ready to carry horses?
21:33:49 <Crisium> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/496354724191272961/546806460009545742/1.png
21:34:06 <Crisium> devotion so strong, just need the ammo
21:34:10 <skram> fuckin' cheesydip over there doing nothing
21:34:14 <skram> booooo
21:34:37 <Crisium> i know, look at that weight on my shoulders
21:35:36 <Zounds> I like Apex so how come I never play it
21:35:41 <Zounds> answer me that pons
21:36:25 <skram> is it because the zounds is too timid
21:37:18 <Zounds> Seems unlikely
21:37:49 <skram> do timid scotsmen exist at all?
21:38:23 <Zounds> yes but we call it timorous
21:38:41 <Zounds> we are real human beings with all the human feelings that comes with it
21:39:17 <skram> hmm
21:45:28 <Dot> i tihnk being too far north effects you
21:46:01 <skram> Its true
21:46:52 <skram> I went north once and got cussed out by someone from cane-land
21:46:54 <skram> now i stay home
21:47:09 <Dot> was it cane?
21:47:42 <skram> im not sure what cane looks like but it might have been
21:49:59 <Dot> like a viking
21:51:42 <Dot> what times you work next week skram?
21:51:50 <Zounds> big ginger guy
21:52:38 <skram> afternoon twice then two night shifts dot
21:52:56 <Dot> that doenst sound good for gaming times
21:54:31 <Dot> i see Anthem is £70, hopefully sales tank at first and the game goes on sale soon after they fix the launch bugs
21:54:47 <skram> we can get some apexing in when i do night shifts
21:54:48 <Dot> i kinda want to fly a robot suite
21:55:04 <skram> im cautiously optimistic about anthem but im not gonna pay 70£ lel
21:55:38 <Dot> me neither 
22:00:14 <Camail> why play anthem when warframe is free
22:00:24 <DuB`> Wee warframe :P
22:00:37 <Camail> is warframe a ping for you
22:00:43 <Dot> probably
22:00:44 <DuB`> No haha
22:00:49 <DuB`> Just played last night with 2 irl frens
22:01:32 <Dot> i tried warframe years ago, and there was like 3 diffrent suites, and 2 styles of map that swapped around a bit
22:01:41 <Dot> so it was probably really early on
22:08:58 <DuB`> There are 61 now
22:09:05 <DuB`> I have 60! :P
22:09:30 <Dot> 61 suites? that seems excessive
22:09:39 <Dot> also im dissapointed you dont have them all
22:09:54 <DuB`> About a third of that count are the upgraded Prime versions of other existing ones
22:11:56 <skram> how many hours do you have in the warframe dub
22:12:10 <Dot> all of them
22:12:15 <skram> thats a lot
22:12:18 <DuB`> Steam shows 1000, ingame count is more like 650
22:12:35 <DuB`> 750*
22:12:42 <DuB`> Which is about the same as my OW hours
22:14:15 <Dot> skram i was going to make sandwiches in prep for tomorow
22:14:20 <Dot> but im tired now
22:14:21 <DuB`> "Poko caught up in a sea of red and I can't tell if it's the blood of the Philly Fusion or the raiments of the Reign!"
22:14:29 <DuB`> Uber is probably the best caster in any game
22:14:30 <DuB`> lol
22:15:16 <Dot> camail, did you get cake yet?
22:15:24 <Camail> not yet
22:15:32 <skram> dont they give you lunch at work dot
22:15:38 <Dot> you should complain to managemnt ca,
22:15:48 <Dot> no skram, what place provides free food?
22:15:53 <Dot> never seen it
22:16:36 <skram> D:

22:16:55 <DoT|Phone1> rip
22:21:03 <skram> did you make your sandwiches yet dot
22:21:24 <DoT|Phone1> no. I'm in bed
22:21:30 <skram> tssk tssk
22:21:47 <DoT|Phone1> I'm bad at adulting
22:21:56 <skram> so's everyone dot
22:22:31 <DoT|Phone1> I need someone to come live with me and just supply me a list of the things I need to do
22:22:53 <Zounds> First things first don't call it adulting
22:23:02 <Zounds> People who say that belong on reddit and nowhere else
22:23:07 <skram> lol
22:23:52 <skram> i forget things and then overcompensate, thats my tactic
22:24:00 <skram> i once forgot TP so now i have 90 bog rolls in the basement
22:24:32 <DoT|Phone1> is Zounds joining us in the grumpy old ppl group. no more slang words
22:25:34 <Zounds> Naw slangs alright
22:25:43 <Zounds> Adulting in particular just triggers me somewhat
22:25:43 <skram> friggin' millenials ay
22:27:01 <Zounds> you live by yourself right skram?
22:27:07 <skram> yeah
22:27:29 <Zounds> you're set for life with bog rolls then lol :p
22:28:33 <skram> sure hope ill be spared the indignity of not having TP again
22:29:52 <DoT|Phone1> I found out millennials starts from ppl born in 1986, that's a lot earlier than I thought
22:30:40 <skram> yeah we're getting old dot
22:30:56 <skram> it doesnt matter what its called of course, we just like to bash the youngsters
22:31:14 <DoT|Phone1> the youths
22:31:15 <skram> with their tide pods and tik toks
22:31:32 <DoT|Phone1> Did you like the link btw Skram k
22:31:36 <DoT|Phone1> ?*
22:32:10 <skram> guy's got moves, dot
22:32:11 <Zounds> Imagine being born into a world with smartphones
22:32:17 <Zounds> Weird D:
22:32:47 <skram> imagine using a non-smart cellphone
22:32:55 <Zounds> what was it like Rawr|Fone 
22:33:34 <skram> i think rawr is pre-smartphones too
22:33:52 <Zounds> he was I was just taking a jab
22:34:29 <DoT|Phone1> Rawr is like 12 Skram
22:35:12 <skram> that was 9 years ago, dot :P
22:35:16 <DoT|Phone1> Skram. I missed him by 30 minutes but cake was here!
22:35:30 <skram> oh man
22:35:43 <Zounds> It it funny to think of the difference growing up now
22:36:04 <skram> cake was the youngest member
22:36:09 <Rawr|Fone> I am actually pretty close to never having used a non-smartphone
22:36:19 <DoT|Phone1> yea. joining Isis wasn't an option open to be Zounds
22:36:37 <DoT|Phone1> me*
22:36:59 <Zounds> I remember going around my buddies houses asking them out to play
22:37:03 <Rawr|Fone> Also cake said he would be back but it's been a couple of days now
22:37:12 <skram> oh no the oldies are reminiscing again
22:37:13 <Zounds> what would you do now, ask in the groupchat?
22:37:17 <Zounds> just play vidya?
22:37:43 <DuB`> Neighborhood discord server :P
22:37:49 <skram> i think kids still hang out zounds
22:37:52 <DoT|Phone1> I don't have friends to know Zounds
22:38:20 <Zounds> They do skram not saying they don't but the way they do its different :P
22:38:24 <Zounds> not worse or anything
22:38:38 <Zounds> Just funny to think that's all
22:39:37 <skram> I work with a bunch of proper oldies and they go off on weird tangents about how there used to be a forest here or how milk used to come in glass bottles or whatever all the time
22:40:41 <Zounds> Aye
22:40:51 <skram> usually ending with some completely random complaint about todays youth and how they dont know how to churn butter or something
22:41:17 <Zounds> It's the small difference in years that contains the threshold between constant instant communication being commonplace and not is interesting though
22:41:34 <skram> one guy was complaining about how his kids are bad at cooking and he didnt agree in my opinion that was sorta his own fault
22:42:14 <skram> many things changed with the dawn of the digital age zounds
22:45:32 <Zounds> I think a tv show that captures that pocket of time pretty well is Malcom in the Middle
22:52:55 <Zounds> night ponners
23:05:56 <Camail> thats a weird one skram, most people are terrible cooks, regardless of age
