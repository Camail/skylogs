00:03:24 <Camail> boy i sure would like a stable connection
00:13:58 <Bio> far too much to ask for
00:25:18 <Runbunny> Have you tried stabilizing it?
00:32:15 <Camail> i'll glue it down
00:34:31 <Runbunny> Found an exalted orb just now.
00:40:56 <Camail> ooh, nice
00:44:23 <Runbunny> For a tabula, you can farm one or just buy one. They are usually about 10 chaos.
00:44:42 <Camail> yea i was looking
00:45:20 <Camail> i had 20c so it wouldn't drain the bank, i just dont like having to trade so many mods just for the 6L
00:45:24 <Camail> have*
00:45:48 <Runbunny> You can do "channel" maps for the divination card.
00:46:08 <Runbunny> Or just run blood aquaducts in act 9.
00:46:44 <Camail> why does that drop them more than other places?
00:47:06 <Runbunny> That's just how it is.
00:47:12 <Camail> >_>
00:47:25 <Camail> weird, but maybe i'll do that
00:47:39 <Runbunny> Some divination cards just drop in certain areas.
00:47:46 <Camail> maybe i'll even find decent rings
00:47:58 <Camail> i have entirely too much cold res
00:48:10 <Runbunny> Even some item bases drop from certain parts of the atlas.
00:48:50 <Camail> yea i tangentially read up on certain bases being from certain places
00:49:22 <Camail> i have the hardest time keeping potions up, because i use my left hand for skills and potions

00:51:08 <Camail> the end game is quite fun
00:51:09 <Runbunny> Yeah, I just panic spam the important ones.
00:51:13 <Camail> way more engaging than greater rifts
00:51:26 <Camail> i dont know which ones i should be spamming

01:02:40 <Runbunny> Goodnight Reif.
01:03:37 <Runbunny> Between the labyrinth, maps, temple, delve and memories, there is a lot of end game now.
01:11:30 <Camail> the temple is very cool
01:11:38 <Camail> a lot of work tho!
01:11:56 <Camail> i have not delved at all, only the bare minimum
01:14:39 <Runbunny> Delve takes a little to get going, but there are tons of rewards in that mine.
01:15:41 <Camail> i felt pretty lost
01:16:00 <Camail> but getting sulphite seems way easier, before i was getting like 25 per mound
01:16:13 <Camail> now its like 125
01:16:17 <Runbunny> It ramps up.
01:16:29 <Runbunny> You get more but later delves require more as well.
01:16:43 <Camail> how long to leagues last
01:16:57 <Runbunny> 3 months.
01:17:06 <Camail> ah, so like 2 months left
01:18:51 <Camail> also, seeing your xph is cool
01:19:01 <Runbunny> league is like 1½ weeks old O:
01:23:08 <Runbunny> Yeah, it's nice that they track it.
01:41:59 <Camail> lab is hard when you dont have any passive hp regen and only one health pot...
01:46:28 <Runbunny> Yeah, it's a bit annoying, even more so if you don't have bleed and poison removal.

10:15:45 <DoT|Phone1> literal tears from hob
10:16:27 <Runbunny> I was sleeping.
10:16:45 <DoT|Phone1> tsk tsk
10:17:17 <Runbunny> I had the stream running though. Until it dc'ed due to network error.
10:18:30 <DoT|Phone1> I can't believe he did it. that final fight was sooo stressful
10:18:35 <DoT|Phone1> just to watch
10:19:01 <Runbunny> It would be a true heartbreaker rip'ing there.
10:19:28 <DoT|Phone1> oh yea

10:21:10 <Runbunny> There were some insane moments.
10:27:10 <DoT|Phone1> capped out at 14k ppl watching
10:28:06 <Runbunny> I noticed that there were 9k people watching at some point.
10:28:16 <Runbunny> I wasn't really looking at viewers though

16:44:09 <Runbunny> You lie. 
16:44:24 <Runbunny> It's 2 different skills in the menu
16:44:52 <Runbunny> So you just have to select the "normal" arc and the vaal arc for 2 different buttons.

18:02:21 <Zounds> I think I'm gonna delay my purchase of Sekiro for a bit
18:02:55 <Zounds> Not really been in much of a mood for new games recently, can't work up much enthusiasm for it
18:03:31 <Zounds> Plus £50 goes a long way for me currently
18:43:55 <reification> well zounds it seems to be xcom 2 free weekend if you haven't played that?
18:46:46 <Zounds> What vidya are you playing these days reif
18:48:51 <Camail> i was wondering why some maps were deleting me, turns out chaos damage absolutely destroys me
18:50:30 <reification> i played satisfactory alpha, made me want to get factorio so i might when it's next on sale
18:51:20 <Zounds> oh nice
18:51:30 <Zounds> you'll be able to join the other builderpons then
18:57:32 <BioPhone> Belt and plate pons
19:05:20 <skram> how 2 succeed at factorio: LONG ASS BELTS, PAL
19:06:09 <Dot> skram, you not go to work today?
19:07:16 <skram> you told me not to
19:14:42 <Camail> skram long belts are really just bad trains
19:19:23 <skram> fight me
19:19:34 <Camail> build trains!
19:19:54 <Dot> good skram
19:21:15 <Camail> i never quite perfected trains in factorio
19:21:42 <Camail> the logic behind their movement was a bit wonky
19:22:36 <Camail> but it was probably the most enjoyable problem to work on
19:37:34 <skram> what wonky about it
19:37:45 <skram> they go to station, do thing you tell it to, then go to next station
19:37:46 <skram> forever
19:37:53 <skram> until the heat death of the universe
19:38:38 <BioPhone> Or you run out of rocket fuel
19:41:10 <Runbunny> Zounds, I think I'll just get Sekiro. I mean I might as well. Even though the whole early release thing is kinda meh. 
19:41:41 <Camail> having multiple trains on a track, and getting them to all run without having to make a huge loop
19:42:06 <Camail> it involved using signals and i couldn't consistently do it
19:42:54 <Camail> also having them stop exactly where i wanted them to wasn't consistent
19:43:03 <Camail> there were always workarounds, but it was hardly elegant
19:43:55 <Camail> i saw some blueprint for train stops but never looked into them before i stopped playing
19:44:26 <Dot> blueprints off the internet are the worst

23:22:44 <reification> also the guy on my left with the viking avatar is earning it
