00:50:37 <BioPhone> They were speaking silly the whole time
00:50:47 <BioPhone> And skiing

00:51:51 <BioPhone> I think it was about Norway actually
00:52:13 <BioPhone> The babby did have a silly name
00:52:17 <skram> oh yeah
00:52:24 <skram> haakon haakonsson
00:52:31 <skram> rightful heir of the throne
00:52:52 <BioPhone> H√•kon H√•konsson
00:53:32 <BioPhone> And that wildling from GoT saved him
00:54:06 <skram> did you learn anything though
00:54:10 <skram> about the birkebeiners

00:56:11 <BioPhone> They can shoot you from skiis

01:04:25 <BioPhone> Baglers
01:04:36 <BioPhone> The men who make bagles
01:04:50 <skram> yeh thats where they come from
01:09:16 <BioPhone> They come from the usurpers to the throne? Man

02:37:24 <Camail_Phone> I caught your phone disease
02:37:36 <Dot`> very contagious
02:37:52 <Camail_Phone> I just wanna monhun
02:37:55 <Camail_Phone> Sooooo bad
02:38:49 <Camail_Phone> Have you done any dividing today dot
02:39:48 <Dot`> Dub and I did
02:40:04 <Dot`> got to lvl 15 in underground and did a few Resistance attempts
02:40:25 <Dot`> getting picked on by axe weilders
02:40:31 <Camail_Phone> Thats quite a bit of math

02:50:05 <Camail_Phone> Gonna be phone for 2 more hourssss
02:50:26 <Dot`> See a doctor
02:50:45 <Camail_Phone> Nah it wont do any lasting damage
02:50:59 <Camail_Phone> Did you get any good loot
02:51:11 <Dot`> i didnt
02:51:31 <Camail_Phone> Bah
02:51:41 <Dot`> dub found out classifides exist and got one piece he liked i think
02:51:42 <Camail_Phone> Blame dub
02:52:00 <Camail_Phone> I told him last year he just forgot
02:52:06 <Dot`> yea, i thought so
02:52:27 <Camail_Phone> I need to look at the sets , i only have a few of those
02:52:49 <Dot`> do i need full 6 all classifieds to get the bonus
02:52:59 <Dot`> or 6 of the set and at least 1 classified
02:53:04 <Camail_Phone> Tanking is fun, if the 6 set is fun i will do it
02:53:11 <Camail_Phone> You need all 6 classified
02:53:18 <Dot`> ....
02:53:19 <Dot`> dam
02:53:45 <Dot`> thats a lot of grinding
02:54:08 <Camail_Phone> Yup
02:54:36 <Camail_Phone> Until then getting  two sets is fine
02:55:02 <Camail_Phone> 4/2 split
02:55:32 <Camail_Phone> Also the higher difficulty stuff probably ly drops better stuff?
02:56:15 <Dot`> i did a 30 second google search and apparently resistances are the fastest way to get loot ppl think
02:56:35 <Dot`> but surely high level underground must be better?
02:56:43 <Camail_Phone> Like, we can all get decent normal sets and good weapons, and be good to go
02:56:47 <Dot`> becuase every Resistance you have to start from lvl 1
02:56:57 <Camail_Phone> Resistance gets harder each wave right
02:57:01 <Dot`> yea
02:57:13 <Camail_Phone> It doesnt take long to get to your dps gate
02:57:15 <Dot`> but startign lvl is always the same, you cant change that
02:57:43 <Camail_Phone> I‚Äôll look it up when i get home
02:57:56 <Camail_Phone> But resistances are the latest content
02:58:05 <Camail_Phone> So it makes sense they give the best stuff
02:58:13 <Dot`> ah, didn know that
02:58:47 <Dot`> They would do that to help try get people to buy it
02:59:01 <Camail_Phone> But mostly for the existing playerbase
02:59:09 <Camail_Phone> Mmo‚Äôs do that a lot
03:00:01 <Camail_Phone> I just wanna do fun stuff with set and weapon stuff
03:00:14 <Camail_Phone> Full classified is like, the endest game
03:01:27 <Camail_Phone> Also i might switch my buff out for the dmg one, feels like doing more damage is always the answer
03:02:27 <Camail_Phone> Especially with my smg
03:02:31 <Dot`> they cant kill you if they are ded
03:02:40 <Camail_Phone> Thats the hope
03:05:59 <Dot`> well i blame dub
03:06:07 <Dot`> gnight
03:06:22 <Camail_Phone> Nn
03:06:23 <Dot`> and Happy New Year Cam
