01:07:49 <skrm> wew lads
01:08:27 <Runbunny> Hai Jonas.
01:09:27 <DuB`> My Discord is borken
01:09:28 <DuB`> HMM
01:11:36 <Runbunny> How borken are we talking?
01:13:37 <DuB`> It won't start or uninstall properly!
01:13:40 <DuB`> Nuking it now
01:14:28 <Runbunny> Rough.
01:15:57 <DuB`> Installers break too
01:15:58 <DuB`> wat
01:16:58 <skrm> could it be that theres something wrong with ur confuser
01:18:06 <Runbunny> Use admin mode.
01:22:26 <DuB`> nuffin
01:24:39 <Camail> dub do you have an error message you could look up
01:25:07 <Camail> doesn't matter if it's vague
01:25:25 <DuB`> Just a 1000-line log of stuff
01:25:50 <Camail> Runbunny yea i looked up her mechanics for the second attempt, this build does not so ele reflect at allll
01:25:53 <Camail> do*
01:26:01 <Camail> dub put it in a paste bin and link me to it
01:26:36 <Camail> if it's a traceback i might be able to figure out what its trying to tell you
01:32:33 <skrm> i got my taxes back today
01:32:59 <skrm> the company i work for reported me with a higher income than i actually have
01:33:18 <skrm> soooo does that mean i have like a 5000$ bonus coming up??
01:33:32 <DuB`> :D
01:34:07 <Camail> try these things https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/209099387--Windows-Installer-Errors
01:34:17 <DuB`> done did
01:35:21 <Camail> both temp folders? dang
01:35:24 <Runbunny> Nice Jonas.
01:35:31 <Runbunny> I get some returns as well. 
01:35:45 <Camail> the fact that you did a messy manual uninstall is the root of the problem, i think
01:36:00 <Camail> but how to solve it is the point
01:36:06 <DuB`> Doesn't explain why it wouldn't startup today to start with :O
01:36:25 <Camail> it might have files outside the discord server that it creates
01:36:48 <Camail> and if it encounters unexpected things it gets confused
01:36:58 <Camail> discord folder* not server
01:38:16 <Camail> if you're on win 7 they have more steps
01:38:41 <Camail> one of the errors is saying that it can't find your keyboard
01:42:24 -!- DuB` [~DuB@66-219-235-226.dynamic.ip.veracitynetworks.com] has joined #tlponies
01:42:36 <Runbunny> Maybe Dub left because he couldn't find his keyboard either.
01:43:12 <DuB`> Discord PTB instantly installed as I restarted PC, but the normal client crashes every window I have open
01:43:18 <DuB`> Whatever
01:43:30 <DuB`> PTB it is
01:43:55 <Camail> makes sense, the ptb uses entirely different directories
01:44:11 <Camail> whatever is preventing you from installing in the normal version is just being dormant
01:44:54 <Camail> this is what happens when you take the bottom piece from the jenga tower!
01:45:00 <Camail> weird, unpredictable stuff
01:45:33 <DuB`> The jenga tower broke without me touching it, I just pushed the pieces off the table
01:45:42 <DuB`> Or something :P
01:47:48 <Runbunny> PTB?
01:48:04 <DuB`> PTB!
01:48:07 <DuB`> Public... test build?
01:50:20 <Runbunny> Public test beta?
01:52:52 <DuB`> Public test build.
01:55:49 <Runbunny> I'll go sleep.
01:56:17 <skrm> bye
01:58:14 <skrm> man im so looking forward to april next year
01:58:19 <skrm> finally we can play the borderlands

01:59:43 <DuB`> Look at it this way skram -- now there will be less bored downtime between finishing BL3 and the eventual release of cyberpunk ;D
02:00:05 <skrm> man get outta here with that positive attitude
02:00:17 <DuB`> Only a TWO YEAR wait instead of THREE! ... maybe.
02:00:25 <skrm> i just wanna write mean things on the internet about the epic launcher
02:01:04 <DuB`> I got another email from them today about someone trying to reset the password on my old account I was sure I'd deleted/dc'ed from
02:01:07 <DuB`> Whoopee
02:03:06 <Camail> i haven't got those emails in a long while
02:03:12 <Camail> maybe i put them into spam
02:03:31 <Camail> just send them all to spam
02:03:45 <Camail> clearly there are a few people trying to automate account stealing
03:31:46 <DuB`> ROFL
03:32:02 <DuB`> I am actually present in 2 discord voice channels on different servers

18:40:55 <Camail> skram also a note about getting your first real body armor later in poe, its gonna be a corrupted 6L because it's the cheapest option
18:41:11 <Camail> t's the cheapest option because you cant use chromatics without also using vaal orbs
18:41:37 <Camail> so 1. you cant change anything and 2. what you can change is expensive, so you gotta get the right type
18:42:56 <Camail> a corrupted 6L is never meant to be your end game, but it's a really good defensive upgrade to the tabula rasa

21:37:42 <Camail> so thats like 2ex right there
21:38:33 <Camail> runbun i'll suck your dick for 2 desert spring maps
21:38:53 <Camail> i had two but i corrupted 1 for the bonus and it fucking changed to reef
21:39:13 <Camail> so now i'm delving while i wait for some of these fuck boys to respond to my trade whispers
21:39:19 <Camail> it's the worst part of this game
21:40:14 <Runbunny> O:
21:40:41 <Runbunny> You can get around it by playing SSF.
21:41:02 <Runbunny> but then you replace the waiting time with much more farming time.
21:41:08 <Runbunny> What level are you?
21:41:10 <Camail> that's just making the problem a game mechanic
21:41:15 <Camail> 91
21:41:23 <Runbunny> Neat.
21:41:31 <Camail> this build is really good at xp farming
21:41:47 <Camail> probably why raiz used it for a race
21:42:03 <Camail> craaazy high mobility
21:54:23 <Camail> wow
21:54:37 <Camail> i think that guy ran a trade script
21:54:52 <Camail> trade bots would be nice, but potentially dangerous
21:56:02 <Camail> Runbunny i'm in discrawd, if you wanna join me
22:00:22 <Runbunny> Alright.
22:00:38 <Runbunny> I don't quite see you though.
