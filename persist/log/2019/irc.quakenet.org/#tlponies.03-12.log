11:59:23 <Runbunny> My hair is killing me.
11:59:37 <Runbunny> craziest dandruff you have never seen.
11:59:48 <reification> oh dear
11:59:49 <Runbunny> So itchy that it keeps me up at night.
12:04:51 <DoT|Phone1> shave all your hair
12:09:52 <Runbunny> I have considered that.
12:10:10 <Runbunny> But my complexion is very sensitive to sun.
12:11:13 <DoT|Phone1> there is no sun in Denmark
12:13:15 <Runbunny> Of course not.
12:13:20 <Runbunny> Sun is in outer space.
12:13:30 <Runbunny> Harmful sun rays though.
