00:07:21 <carcinization> night all
00:15:36 <Dot> gnight reif
00:16:26 <skram> .tell bio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZf9hMbdZTc
00:18:23 <Bio> hello
00:22:56 <Bio> MAYMES
01:23:23 <DoT|Phone> Skram
01:30:18 <skram> yeah buddy
01:30:40 <DoT|Phone> How's you
01:30:57 <skram> very sleepy
01:31:44 <skram> are you excited yet
01:31:56 <DoT|Phone> how'd I do? I need vindication pls
01:34:56 <skram> well we dont know yet
01:36:53 <DoT|Phone> Well there is about 12+ things just on session zero my brain is telling me I should have done different. my brain hates me.
01:39:23 <DoT|Phone> for instance did ppl like going through all those rules choices? so many things
01:48:01 <Camail> dort
01:48:04 <Camail> pls
01:48:34 <DoT|Phone> no cam
01:48:55 <Camail> I'm plsing as hard as i can
01:48:57 <Camail> PLS
01:49:46 <Camail> it's hard to have an outright negative experience
01:50:47 <Camail> a session where you aren't playing is more of a meeting, and you can't get a meeting wrong
01:51:44 <skram> ya
01:51:53 <skram> we agreed on the things and made stupid characters, dot
01:51:57 <skram> all you need for a good time
01:52:07 <Camail> you have like, so little control over how much other people do or do not enjoy your DM style
01:52:22 <Camail> all you can do is refine your personal preferences, and go
01:54:14 <Camail> the dynamic is a bit complicated, because your job as a dm is to service the players, but you're just as much a player of the game as they are
01:54:42 <Camail> you have equal right to entertainment, so worrying about player experience should really be secondary to your own
01:55:04 <Camail> you specifically, cuz there are some asshats who should care more
01:55:11 <Camail> like skram
01:55:37 <skram> r u d e
01:56:48 <DoT|Phone> cam, Skram is going to play a monk and I still don't believe it
01:56:55 <Camail> dwarf?
01:56:58 <DoT|Phone> his most hated class
01:57:08 <Camail> monk is basically barb
01:57:15 <DoT|Phone> of course a dorf
01:57:17 <Camail> like, they are so similar
01:57:23 <Camail> at least he isn't gong to crazy
01:57:37 <Camail> going too*
01:57:48 <Camail> but yea, attacks a lot, high movement speed, no armor
01:57:49 <DoT|Phone> have you tried tanking with a monk?
01:57:54 <DoT|Phone> I did once
01:58:00 <skram> i do remember that
01:58:04 <Camail> tanks aren't a thing in dnd 5e
01:58:15 <DoT|Phone> you rolled 2 Nat 20s
01:58:31 <Camail> that wasn't the time that really messed you up tho
01:58:41 <Camail> it was in the cave with the necro and they kept hitting you
01:58:46 <Camail> that was funny
01:59:01 <Camail> my disadv. rolls are stronger than my normal rolls
01:59:21 <Camail> the ice beam crit was a cap stone
01:59:28 <DoT|Phone> my life of dnd. providing other ppl good rolls
01:59:33 <Bio> you underestimate my power!
02:01:34 <Camail> my personal favorite part was when one of you picked up the diamond and it shattered
02:01:40 <Camail> i thiiink it was skramboi?
02:02:35 <skram> my dwarf has his booger hooks on everything
02:02:40 <DoT|Phone> I don't recall a diamond but I recall Skram pushing a button
02:02:47 <DoT|Phone> and collapsing a tunnel on us
02:02:54 <Camail> it was the dub retrieval arc
02:03:03 <skram> oh yeah
02:03:35 <skram> remember that other time i pressed a button and almost killed everyone
02:03:53 <Camail> was that below red larch
02:04:05 <skram> yeah
02:04:09 <skram> secret entrance iirc
02:04:28 <Camail> then there was that time i almost killed you all
02:04:41 <Camail> because the encounter calculator is terrible
02:05:27 <Camail> if i ever dm again i will never do random battles again, they are the antithesis to my soul
02:06:38 <DoT|Phone> I've read that module since and see what they are trying to do with those random encounters but as players you don't get it at all
02:06:44 <DoT|Phone> It's just random
02:06:58 <Camail> its just meant to make you not want to travel everywhere all the time
02:07:21 <Camail> but like... i would prefer to make my towns interesting
02:07:58 <Camail> and players are kinda just sheep, you can herd them wherever you want if you describe the things you want them to go to
02:08:00 <DoT|Phone> It's suppose to also a retribution and counter strikes from the cult.
02:08:15 <Camail> thats later on
02:08:22 <Camail> much later than where we got
02:09:05 <Camail> you guys were just about the fuck with the water cults lowest members, once you clear the 4 low level dungeons then the cult starts caring about you
02:10:00 <DoT|Phone> then it's months of dungeon crawling
02:17:25 <DoT|Phone> it was actually between that and storm kings thunder when I first started looking again too run a game
02:17:35 <DoT|Phone> it has a lot of cool stuff
03:19:37 <Camail> .tell skram if you wanna remake characters and do a non-minion build i can play with ya. we'll find a build for you if the spider isn't coming together fast enough
03:19:55 <Camail> also dot if you're here, we can play poe whenever you feel like

19:38:52 <Camail> because we all know she was a huge slut
20:10:21 <Camail> Runbunny this build keeps asking me to socket more and more stuff T_T
20:12:09 <Runbunny> Yeah, rolling 4 sockets on something isn't too bad. Rolling 6 sockets and linking them will you pass your debt unto your children's children.
20:12:21 -!- BioPone [~androirc@38.142.65.18] has joined #tlponies
20:12:50 <Runbunny> Also giving an item quality improves the odds of more sockets and links.
20:19:35 <Camail> cool
20:20:12 <Camail> my goal now is to get daggers with 3 slots and a 6 slot, but thy dont need to be linked
20:20:19 <Camail> but going from wans to daggers feels weird
20:20:46 <Camail> but it makes sense that cast speed scales higher than spell damage%
20:21:39 <Camail> it doesnt really matter at the moment because i'm still shredding everything
20:22:09 <Camail> not instantly deleting mobs, but still doing fine
20:23:29 <Camail> i still dont understand how i am supposed to generate endurance charges
20:23:49 <Runbunny> For what do you need to generate endurance charges?
20:24:43 -!- BioPone [~androirc@mobile-107-92-120-254.mycingular.net] has joined #tlponies
20:26:19 <Camail> i'm supposed to link Cast when Damage taken, Immortal Call & Increased Duration 
20:26:25 <Camail> immortal call cares about endurance, right?
20:26:54 <Camail> it also tells me to use whirling blades, which i assume replaces flame step for this build
20:27:58 <Runbunny> Immortal call has more duration with endurance charges, but you don't really care about that.
20:28:33 <Runbunny> You just want the immortal call effect to give that extra split second where you can't die.
20:29:31 <Runbunny> Whirling blades is technically faster than flame dash, but you can't do up ledges with it. However most builds usually use shield charge for movement.
20:29:52 <Runbunny> But you can use either of these with wands.
20:31:14 <Camail> hmmm, i do really enjoy going up ledges
20:31:51 <Camail> probably gonna skip that part for the forseeable future
20:32:33 <Camail> i still want daggers i think, i've noticed spell damage hasn't been scaling super well because it's additive
20:32:49 <Camail> well, additive to itself
20:33:47 <Camail> a bit more crit chance and cast speed will be nice

21:06:40 <Zounds> I actually had a look at her twitter she's a proper nutter
21:07:36 <skram> it is a bit sad, zounds
21:10:07 <Zounds> Yeah
21:11:12 <Camail> the current drama seems to be about a dvd commentary
21:11:13 <Runbunny> Hermione is black you guys!
21:11:19 <Camail> oh which, the actual quote is pretty tame
21:11:23 <Camail> of*
21:12:22 <Camail> but really this is just the world being forced to deal with a thirsty artist because she's hyper popular
21:12:49 <Zounds> I liked her way more before I ever heard anything she had to say
21:12:56 <Camail> the real crime is how terrible the ending of the 8th movie was
21:13:36 <Zounds> Does Death of the Author apply to shite pulled out of thin air years after the fact
21:13:46 <Camail> hey zounds i have a secret
21:13:57 <Camail> all fantasy books are shit pulled out of thin air
21:14:30 <Zounds> Well that's not really true though
21:14:44 <Zounds> You don't just make up things randomly from scratch usually
21:15:26 <Camail> she isn't making things from scratch. She's augmenting her previously created characters
21:15:37 <Camail> do i agree with the content? frankly i dont care
21:16:02 <Camail> but hey, it's all just elaborate lies, there's no sanctity in fiction
21:16:08 <Zounds> Aye, well the changes she makes are not much of a concern to me either she's just trying to stay relevant
21:16:43 <Zounds> But take a look at her twitter sometime and you'll be in for a treat disregarding harry potter completely
21:17:03 <Camail> yea i've seen it occasionally
21:17:26 <Camail> i pretty aggressively avoid toxicity on twitter tho
21:17:57 <Zounds> I think turning your twitter into an art timeline is the best use for it
21:18:06 <Zounds> I leave twitter to reif
21:18:26 <Camail> ironically, twitter is terrible for art cuz of the compression
21:18:35 <Camail> it's just the easiest now that tumblr is dead
21:30:09 <Runbunny> Contact artists directly for non-compressed versions.
21:37:04 <Camail> i use aggregaters because that would require too much work for the bandwidth going through my feed
21:37:40 <Camail> that would be good advice for most people, i dont happen to save art
21:38:31 <Camail> some also put alt links to good uploads in the same tweet, which is nice

22:26:44 <skram> Camail what level are you in poe now
22:29:45 <Camail> ~50
22:31:21 <DoT|Phone> I'm so far behind
22:31:31 <Camail> pls
22:31:35 <Camail> i played a lot
22:31:38 <Camail> an unreasonable amount
22:31:50 <Camail> we should all play
22:31:52 <DoT|Phone> I made a character but haven't looked at builds yet
22:32:10 <skram> did you do nothing else for like 20 hours cam
22:32:22 <Camail> so one thing i can tell you is that having a build early on is important, but only for getting the right passive skills
22:32:35 <Camail> i haven't played yet today skram
22:32:36 <skram> i just did <10 levels and it felt like a long time
22:32:43 <Camail> but i did play all day friday and saturday
22:32:58 <skram> werent you 30-something when we played yesterday
22:33:04 <Camail> i dont think my brain lets me do things unless i go hard?
22:33:14 <Camail> when we started, yea
22:33:23 <Camail> i finished act 5 
22:33:30 <Camail> and half of act 6, but they get pretty short
22:33:49 <Camail> i'm still really bad so it's fun learning
22:33:58 <Camail> the time flies by because i'm so focused on figuring shit out
22:35:08 <Camail> dot what class did you choose
22:37:16 <DoT|Phone> paladin.  my previous character was a witch
22:38:31 <Camail> is that templar?
22:43:57 <DoT|Phone> Yea
22:44:04 <DoT|Phone> close enough
22:48:06 <Camail> i lucked out with a super comprehensive levelling guide
22:48:20 <Camail> i feel like that's equally as important
22:48:53 <Runbunny> Typically Dot to pick a old guy who doesn't wear pants.
22:49:43 <DoT|Phone> have to have role models Runbun
22:50:23 <Camail> do you wanna melee, range, or spells
