02:29:25 <Camail> Runbunny so i'm using poetrade and whispering people, they normally respond but when it's a relatively low cost item, ie the mausoleum map, i have yet to find and response
02:29:41 <Camail> is there a different etiquette for these bulk/useless items
02:54:23 <Runbunny> hmm.. 
02:54:28 <Runbunny> I don't think so.
02:54:53 <Runbunny> You can try looking for a unidentified rare version of the map.
02:55:03 <Runbunny> Since those are needed for a challenge.

19:22:01 <Zounds> all others suxxors nutzzors
19:22:47 <Crisium> broodwar is the best forever
19:26:59 <Zounds> Yes
19:32:02 <Zounds> what's your opinion of baptiste on live Crisium 
19:32:12 <Zounds> the one game I played him we got smashed so I never really had a good try
19:33:58 <Crisium> his immortal thing is broken if used right
19:34:27 <Crisium> other than that he is balanced, he can shit out AOE heals, but has a crap self-heal
19:36:56 <DuB`> If his invincibility is used properly juuust around a corner or with shields his team is well and truly unkillable.
19:37:03 <DuB`> Seemed pretty anti-fun
19:38:06 <Crisium> yeah if you use it behind a wall but you stay in LOS, you cant die and they cant shoot it unless they literally go through ppl who cant die
19:38:13 <Crisium> basically get the full 8s of immortality
19:39:15 <DuB`> Nearly 50% uptime on aoe invicibility...
19:39:17 <DuB`> wat
19:39:47 <DuB`> "People seemed to like nothing ever dying in GOATS, so this is the next logical step!"
19:40:17 <Crisium> problem is if they change it to where you can shoot it no matter what... then it's just a barrier basically
19:40:32 <Crisium> so the design they chose is hurting them

19:41:14 <Camail> pls
19:41:59 <DuB`> I thought the ability might be okay until I actually tried killing one...
19:42:17 <DuB`> Takes pretty much lucio's entire mag, and like 4 rightclicks from 100 energy zarya
19:42:24 <Dot> no cam
19:42:25 <DuB`> or*
19:52:01 <Zounds> By the time you kill it you're already all dead anyway I guess
19:55:13 <Crisium> well if at least 2 ppl focus it, it does quickly
19:55:51 <Crisium> biggest problem is really when its around a wall, you cant get kills for 8 full seconds unless you reposition while taking fire from immortal ppl the whole time
19:56:42 <Camail> splash damage characters new meta
19:56:56 <Camail> this was a ploy to get junk rat more play time
20:00:42 <Zounds> May god have mercy on us all
20:00:55 <DuB`> Well junk did get a damage buff but I don't think he does much to baptiste stuff :P
20:02:24 <Camail> in magic theory land, if the map is just a hallway, baptiste seems broken
20:02:37 <Camail> so they must've designed him to get away from that idea
20:02:49 <Camail> maybe they want genji flanks
20:03:03 <Camail> genji junkrat comps
20:19:44 <Dot> cam, should i care if an item is corrupted?
20:19:59 <Camail> if its an upgrade you should use it
20:20:05 <Camail> all that means is that you can't alter it with orbs
20:20:18 <Camail> or increase it's quality
20:33:03 <Zounds> make the drone a big X shape that covers the entire radius

20:53:09 <Camail> dot is there anything you need in poe?
20:53:29 <Dot> A SKRAM
20:53:32 <Dot> caps
20:54:10 <Dot> only level 46 cam, havnt started looking for the gear the guide recomends yet
20:54:17 <Camail> also, you can take advantage of the poe trade site for budget or low tier items that you might need
20:54:22 <Camail> can you link me the guide
20:54:33 <Camail> because some of the recommendations might just be end game
20:54:57 <Camail> as in, stuff you won't get to for like a month
20:55:36 <Camail> but like, i have a tabula rasa and it might be relevent to your build
20:56:03 <Camail> it's not terribly relevant to skrams, so if it's more important to your build to have a torso 6L then i'd lend it out
20:58:40 <Camail> going from d3 to poe was kind of a paradigm shift, this game is way harsher, and the stat ceiling is way higher
20:59:06 <skram> Dot are you playing
20:59:33 <Camail> steam says no
20:59:42 <Camail> he's just bitter that you abandoned him
21:00:02 <skram> well then
21:00:44 <Runbunny> Sekiro has a really nice feel to it when you get the combat flowing.

21:01:41 * skram slaps Dot around a bit with a large trout
21:03:20 <Camail> i ate an entire bag of celery and my stomach is not fooled in the LEAST
21:03:28 <Camail> i have never been so hungry after eating so much
21:03:49 <Runbunny> Celery? 
21:03:58 <Runbunny> Which part of the celery?
21:04:01 <Runbunny> Also why?
21:04:14 <BioPhone> Fill it back up with water
21:04:15 <Camail> because it tastes good
21:04:22 <skram> because the green stuff is good for you, runbunny
21:04:38 <Camail> i'm one of those crazy people who can enjoy a decent number of healthy foods
21:04:50 <Runbunny> I mean, why particularly celery?
21:04:57 <Camail> oh, no reason
21:05:05 <Camail> it was there and i wanted toe at it
