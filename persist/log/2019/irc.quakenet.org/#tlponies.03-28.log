19:27:11 <skram> holla when you done?
19:27:14 <Camail> TINY TINA IS LESS TINY
19:27:16 <Camail> WOAH
19:27:24 <Camail> will do
19:27:35 <skram> i hope moxxie stil has BIG ASS TIDDIES
19:27:42 <Camail> not too big
19:28:01 <Camail> am i the only weeb who likes normal tiddies
19:29:00 <skram> i think runbun likes tiddyless instead
19:29:08 <Camail> yea, it's either end of the spectrum
19:29:27 <Camail> and both sides are vehement they are the best
19:34:28 <reimeuk> yes i'm afraid anime tiddy views do seem to be very polarised
19:34:40 <Zounds> runbun is a man of culture
19:34:59 <skram> haha no
19:35:27 <Zounds> wanna fight about it
19:35:35 <skram> regardless of what tiddies runbun likes
19:35:53 <Camail> i'm not against any tiddy, there certainly are too many big tiddy, but also normal tiddy is very good
19:38:00 <Zounds> big tiddies are for people who were not weaned untill the age of five prove me wrong
19:38:05 <Zounds> protip: you can't
19:39:03 <skram> its ok pal
19:39:09 <skram> its 2019, any tiddy is good
19:39:33 <skram> unless its attached to someone who's 439 years old but looks 12
19:39:53 <Zounds> Yeah that's disgusting
19:39:57 <Zounds> they should just be 12
19:40:07 <skram> lel
19:40:19 <reimeuk> "its 2019, any tiddy is good" makes me think there is some kind of chinese lunar calendar for these things
19:40:33 <skram> probably isa tbf
19:40:36 <Zounds> But really I haven;t given much thought to anime tiddies
19:40:42 <reimeuk> year of the flat chest etc.
19:40:45 <Zounds> if I like who they're attached to it probably like the tiddies
19:41:25 <skram> when was year of the big tiddy goth reif
19:41:28 <Dot> now i want to play BL2 again
19:41:45 <Dot> unrelated to the tiddie discussion, i just watched the BL3 reveal
19:42:28 <Camail> gearbox is so fucking wholesome
19:43:04 <Zounds> except when they're advertising aliens colonial marines
19:43:13 <Golly> or leaving usbs with porn
19:43:22 <skram> w hat
19:45:56 <skram> alright then
19:46:53 <Zounds> yeh randy pitchford left a porn filled USB at a restaurant
19:46:59 <Zounds> by accident probably but not that wholesome
19:47:04 <Camail> ok got to the announcment, but the video is choppy as fuck
19:47:10 <Camail> gonna wait for the upload to watch it
19:47:26 <skram> they show it again and its not choppy
