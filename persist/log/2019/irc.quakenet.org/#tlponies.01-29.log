09:07:55 <DoT|Phone1> I'm out of Swedish
09:26:04 <Camail> i've killed most
09:26:09 <Camail> some of them really dont want to be killed
09:27:10 <DoT|Phone1> it's fine, just blame your party
09:27:10 <Camail> dunno if i ever even want to try at kirin, but at vaal is doable if i get a efluvium res deco then tradeout my unscathed charm for a miasma charm
09:27:37 <Camail> my build is kinda nuts so i can carry just about any team through most mons
09:28:00 <Camail> any of the normal tempered are EZ, but then they get mean
09:28:42 <DoT|Phone1> how much better is monster Hunter to dauntless?
09:29:10 <Micen|Droid> Hello! 
09:29:20 <Camail> i've thought about it a bit
09:29:38 <Camail> the world is just so much more fleshed out
09:29:48 <Camail> the art direction is way better
09:30:13 <Camail> the weapons are way more fun
09:30:36 <Camail> thats really the crux of it, each weapon has just one extra dimension that makes them fun to play
09:31:10 -!- Rawr|Fone [~AndChat52@84-217-62-32.customers.ownit.se] has joined #tlponies
09:31:16 <Camail> dauntless end game is harder, to an extent
09:31:52 <Camail> the armor design is better and i hated dauntless faces so much
09:32:14 <Camail> not to mention that the progression was more aggressively lootbox based with the cores
09:32:38 <Micen|Droid> Dot, dmimg went good! My players had fun and it was mostly me sitting back and letting the characters do their thing. 
09:36:05 <Camail> i dont want it to come across that i'm shitting on dauntless, i played a ton of it, it's a really fun game
09:36:22 <Camail> but it is severely limited by it's budget and it's art style
09:36:56 <Camail> i'd recommend it as a starter game for anyone interested in the genre tho, its free and lets you know if you like those games
09:37:20 <DoT|Phone1> hmm
09:38:38 <Camail> mhw gives you a legit sense of adventure and immersion that dauntless cant deliver on
09:38:56 <Camail> having a real map, not just a gussied up arena, FEELS good
09:40:26 <DoT|Phone1> so nice improvements in every area. good to know
09:46:35 <Camail> also elements matter less in mhw, which is nice
09:46:42 <Camail> i like just having one weapon

19:20:23 <Camail> how so
19:20:29 <Runbunny> Random monster attacks and roars and stuff.
19:21:07 <Camail> do you have to do all the notes in a single string or can you dodge in between
19:21:43 <Runbunny> oh you can dodge and stuff. You can't sheathe though

20:06:02 <Runbunny> Camail, Yeah longsword is pretty great. 20% of all players on PC use long sword though. Hunting horn is the least used weapon, Gunlance is second least used :D
20:06:14 <Camail> i see a pattern
20:06:25 <Camail> you are what we call a reverse tier whore
20:06:30 <Camail> a tier nun, if you will
20:06:32 <Runbunny> I know!
20:07:31 <Camail> getting the helmsplitter on the head feels so good

20:34:11 <Camail> i think i might get the miasma decos
20:34:18 <Camail> the blight is just so annoying
20:34:33 <Runbunny> I did that. Just 3x vitality and 3x miasma.
20:34:41 <Runbunny> It helps a lot.
20:34:48 <Camail> i sold all mine

20:35:13 <Runbunny> The greatest Jagras for you then.
20:35:32 <Camail> i'm just gonna use the miasma charm after i find one deco
20:35:42 <Runbunny> I think there's a hunting horn deco but I don't have it yet.
20:35:49 <Camail> my charm slot is actually really flexible once i got my 3rd wex deco
20:35:54 <Camail> sonorous
