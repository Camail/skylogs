03:28:28 <Camail> .tell runbunny yea, that's a RIP. luckily  i dont have to deal with it as LS. I figured out a way to get a pretty consistent 5 minute kill tho. using the pitfall trap while its stomach is full lets you do soooo much damage, then chain it into a trip

21:04:07 <Camail> basement flooded

21:04:15 <Dot> did the flooding freeze?

21:04:25 <Camail> it froze, burst a pipe, then flooded
21:04:31 <Phearlock> oh dear
21:04:33 <Dot> :/
21:04:34 <Camail> but everything is fixed and drying
21:04:37 <Camail> so it's fine
21:04:39 <Phearlock> yay
21:04:43 <Camail> lots of holes in the wall
21:05:16 <skram> is it hella cold in the place you live these days cam
21:05:21 <Camail> had about 120 gallons in the floor
21:05:37 <Camail> well it was around -25f for two days
21:05:51 <Camail> which is -31 c
21:06:02 <Camail> and that completely froze the pipe
21:06:08 <DuB`> It's been almost like spring here already :o
21:06:15 <DuB`> No excitement
21:06:36 <Camail> luckily my family is fucking amazing
21:06:49 <Camail> and my uncles fixed everything perfectly
21:06:50 <skram> hell yeah
21:07:35 <Camail> 120 gl is 454 liters btw
21:07:47 <Camail> and I caught it relatively early
21:08:19 <Camail> could've been like...5 times, 10 times that? in the worst case
21:10:59 <skram> yeah water pipes in winter is kinda scary
21:11:12 <skram> is there a drain where it burst though?

21:50:35 <Dot> hey Crisium
21:50:41 <Crisium> hi Dot
22:04:41 <Camail> nah skram it was in a wall and the drain was in the laundry room on the other side of the basement
22:05:04 <Camail> and now i am done fanning out the stacks of paper to dry, gonna take a break
22:13:20 <skram> oh dang
22:13:36 <skram> glad it worked out though
22:13:52 <skram> water damage is terrifying
22:15:12 <Camail> yea, but we did a really thorough cleaning and no its just a waiting game, a vast majority of the stuff was lifted off the ground
22:15:18 <skram> had a lil pinprick leak in the room above my room at our old house and i had to replace a bunch of the roof
22:15:49 <Camail> yea, this was about a 3cm hole that burst
22:16:25 <Camail> then while we were nearly done with that, another spot opened up, in reality then entire pipe froze and burst in multiple places
22:16:38 <skram> mains pressure is probably >1 bar or something
22:17:04 <skram> well usually a pipe bursts when frozen and then starts leaking when the ice thaws because it sorta acts like a plug
22:17:25 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun if you want to watch some really broken magic
22:18:09 <Camail> yea we've had this problem before
22:18:38 <Camail> our family is pretty big into housing and real estate so we all have a general knowledge what this stuff
22:18:58 <Camail> i've been a part of like 4 flooding clean ups over the years
22:19:46 <Camail> this wall had it's insulation improperly installed and we knew that but my dad didn't want to tear it all down and fix it, but there's no more room for cheap bandaids
22:20:28 <skram> well this is a good opportunity :p
