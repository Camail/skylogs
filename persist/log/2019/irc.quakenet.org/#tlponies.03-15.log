18:59:06 <Camail> cr doesn't advertise their sub count at all, so we have no idea
18:59:18 <Camail> they're getting 50k a week, which means they're growing
18:59:48 <Camail> the beignning of the campaign had 100k for the first episode, then it settled into the high 30's and increased to 50k after about a year
19:00:12 <Camail> and it's only gonna get bigger with the KS stuff, then even bigger once the animation starts releasing

21:13:32 <Camail> Runbunny i'm gonna try poe
21:13:47 <Camail> but i'm expressly trying to be as casual as possible until i beat the game
21:13:57 <Camail> other than following a build
21:18:10 <Runbunny> Alright?
21:18:43 <Runbunny> Have you figured out a build?
21:22:42 <Camail> not entirely sure yet
21:22:57 <Camail> i really don't want it to be mouse-hand intensive
21:23:04 <Camail> figured minions would be good for that
21:26:42 <Runbunny> I guess. I never dabbled much in summoner builds.
21:27:02 <Camail> any opinions?
21:27:07 <Camail> i know you like the game
21:27:12 <Camail> thought you would care
21:32:34 <BioPone> Omw home bois
21:32:47 <Runbunny> Well last league a cold DoT build was really strong, still is. This league, the new skill Bane seems really strong from what I have seen.
21:33:02 <Runbunny> Which is like a chaos curse dot skill.
21:34:33 <Runbunny> I don't like summoner build, since it seems like the "best" version is spectres, which is like resurrecting the mob. But corpses are zone and level dependend. So you typically want a certain type of mob from a certain zone. Which to me seems like a hassle.
21:35:13 <Camail> ah, that's weird, but very diablo 2
21:35:32 <Camail> necro was always pretty garbage
21:36:06 <Runbunny> Spectres are pretty strong (At least they were).
21:36:49 <Runbunny> I did hear about a "everything" summoner, where you basically get all the summons.
21:37:10 <Runbunny> Zombies, golems, skeletons, spectres and phantasms. 
21:37:26 <Camail> all the builds i see have Herald of Agony, whatever that is
21:37:43 <Runbunny> and you end up with like 100 summons, because of vaal summon skeletons.
21:38:17 <Runbunny> Heralds are a personal buff, that reverses mana.
21:38:46 <Runbunny> Herald of agony gives you stacks and summons a crazy strong spider.
21:52:55 <Bio> he
21:52:59 <Bio> is I
21:53:52 <Crisium> ho
21:53:53 <Crisium> is u
21:54:11 <Camail> hmm, herald of agony still needs you to poison and that's basically just a ranged build with extra steps
21:55:18 <Camail> ah, more builds are lower down, looking at spectre now

22:38:33 <Runbunny> Camail, I assume you have a loot filter ready for PoE. Game is pretty much horrid without one.
22:39:03 <Camail> yea that's a good idea, wont matter too much for the beginning
22:39:25 <Camail> Dot  skram wanna try poe with me
22:39:34 <Runbunny> It's "scales" with what level zone you're in.
22:39:35 <Camail> i'm looking at builds now, there's a lot of them
22:39:43 <Camail> but i suspect most of them are basically the same
22:40:00 <skram> sure cam
22:40:16 <Camail> dub isn't allowed to play
22:40:20 <Camail> he knows what he did
22:40:40 <Camail> oh! and skram i forgot. you need to atone for your various sins

22:40:56 <skram> which sins specfically
22:41:04 * Camail hands skram the flagellant whip
22:41:08 <Camail> most of them
22:41:14 <DuB`>  The lewd ones or the degenerate ones?
22:41:16 <Camail> the really bad ones can't be cleaned out
22:41:20 <Camail> so you just gotta live with those
22:41:27 <skram> flagellate me, daddy
22:41:37 <Bio> pretty sure thats another one
22:41:38 <Camail> that just added to the pile
