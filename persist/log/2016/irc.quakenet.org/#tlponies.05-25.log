00:00:35 <Runbunny> To get cat ears through a mutation would be more difficult than just creating a gene and inserting it into dna.
00:00:35 <DoT`> i mean you could always just get some large cat, cut its ears off and sew them onto someone
00:01:13 <Phearlock> At least you might have VR catgirls pretty soon
00:01:29 <Runbunny> at least.
00:01:34 <Runbunny> I also have to sleep.

21:35:05 <Camail> nah
21:35:52 <Camail> oh wow i just realized something
21:36:01 <Camail> blizzard is yet again the king of cinematics
21:36:17 <DoT`> with a whole movie this time?
21:36:26 <Camail> they gained the title in diablo 2 but after that they havent really had that world class renown
21:36:37 <Camail> sc2 was great but not glorious, same with d3
21:37:01 <DoT`> D3 had some epic cutscenes with tyrial
21:37:05 <Camail> but overwatch has shown how they are the undisputed best video game company at cinematics
21:37:14 <Camail> yea d3 was fucking amazing
21:37:34 <Camail> but compared to the oomf of d2 (which was a permanent game changer) it wasnt quite as up there
21:37:41 <Camail> I loooooove d3 cinematics
21:38:00 <DoT`> hmm, what else was out at the same time as D2?
21:38:04 <Camail> but d2 cinematics...they affected the kinds of things i LIKED
21:38:36 <Camail> 2000
21:38:44 <Camail> so final fantasy 7 came out 2 years before that
21:38:55 <Camail> competed with the Perfect Year of 1998
21:39:03 <DoT`> i have never played a any FF
21:39:03 <Camail> and honestly demolished all of them soundly in this area
21:39:15 <motbob> the d3 cinematics are siiick, i'm playing through that game for the first time right now
21:39:18 <Camail> like d2 looks better than ff10 in cut scenes
21:39:21 <Camail> 100% i believe that
21:39:31 <Camail> which came out a year later
21:39:33 <motbob> [overwatch] https://gfycat.com/FoolhardyEvergreenInganue
21:39:39 <Phearlock> I feel a lot of that is character design and writing though
21:39:57 <DoT`> nice mot, what you playing as?
21:40:02 <Phearlock> but yeah I loved D2 cutscenes
21:40:16 <Phearlock> though I didn't play it until years after it came out
21:40:18 <DoT`> hahaha, mei and mcree
21:40:22 <Camail> ultimately everything is perfect in the trailers
21:40:24 <DoT`> my most hated heroes
21:40:45 <DoT`> dub
21:41:24 <Camail> the eye candy is what made sc2 and d3 really amazing to watch
21:41:35 <Rawr|Phone> The warcraft cinematics are amazing cam
21:41:39 <Camail> but honestly the animation of the voerwatch trailers is insane
21:42:13 <Camail> and lets be real here, the story kinda doesnt exist in overwatch
21:42:17 <Camail> we know very little
21:42:23 <Camail> evil guys, racism, old gaurd coming back
21:42:24 <Camail> thats about it
21:42:47 <DoT`> but between the trailers, comics and what the characters say ingame its building up
21:42:54 <Camail> but its compelling because of the great characters, animation, and overall amazing character-driven composition of the trailers
21:43:22 <Phearlock> Yup, I couldn't care less about any overarching story (cause there currently is none)
21:43:37 <Phearlock> but they're amazing character videos
21:43:47 <Camail> overwatch has lore, not a story
21:43:49 <Camail> at the moment
21:43:58 <Camail> there is no narrative, and there can't be in game
21:44:09 <Camail> its kinda like how tf2 does its stories
21:44:10 <motbob> i think the trailers are ass but that's because i'm holding them to the standard of pixar films
21:44:15 <motbob> they asked for it tbh
21:44:16 <Camail> honestly there are a lot of non-gameplay similaritties
21:44:27 <Camail> tf2 has been doing character trailers for years now
21:44:44 <Phearlock> I do wonder if they want to do something with OW in terms of story
21:44:53 <motbob> they DID want to
21:44:55 <motbob> for 5 years
21:44:57 <Phearlock> Yeah
21:44:58 <motbob> when it was Titan
21:44:59 <Phearlock> but do they still?
21:45:08 <Camail> want is not the same as will, here
21:46:17 <Camail> also mot yea there's a reason I've prefaced them as the video game company that does the best cinematic. I wouldn't go quite so far as saying they're bad but yea
21:46:27 <Camail> also the in-game animations are really good
21:46:35 <Camail> for what they are
21:46:59 <Camail> games can't have fancy animation or else they get too slow
21:47:14 <Camail> but eeven the walking animations are really character driven
21:47:36 <Camail> just looking at reinhardt's walk animation in this gif says so much
21:56:13 <Golly> the thing that gets me is how much it overlaps now
21:56:53 <Golly> between animation-trailer-ingame etc
22:00:59 <Camail> yea the gap between pre-rendered and in-game has closed especially for stylized games
22:02:54 <motbob> i thought the gap pretty much closed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVX0OUO9ptU
22:06:51 <motbob> this video's quality got butchered pretty bad by youtube...
22:10:42 <Camail> yea, hopefully we've reached a point where we can focus even more on optimizaiton and performance than just visuals
22:10:57 <Camail> which kinda has happened in the last 5 years but not as much as i would want
22:11:13 <Camail> the uncanny valley is deep, dont want to go back there
