00:02:33 <ZK> I dont love that cause it feels really gamey/mechanical, instead of being inspiration for doing something in the moment. Say Fate it's give you +2 on that roll, and that's that. You did your roleplaying, got rewarded, are happy, and now you keep roleplaying and maybe you'll get points again.
00:02:49 <Camail> then I'm not doing anything
00:02:51 <Camail> have it your way
00:02:51 <ZK> Hmm, maybe that's just DnD mechanically though. I dunno
00:02:54 <Camail> done with this
00:03:12 <ZK> Sorry, didn't mean to get you upset on this :/ Just trying to discuss stuff.
00:03:27 <Camail> No you're trying to convince me
00:03:43 <Camail> which is failing in more ways than you know
00:03:52 <ZK> Aren't all arguments that though? How do you have an argument if you don't believe different things?
00:04:13 <Camail> there are multiple kinds of arguments
00:04:21 <ZK> and obviously i prefer different things, and honestly I don't know the perfect solution to inspiration.
00:04:26 <Camail> some are to find the truth, this one is about what you want me to do
00:04:36 <Camail> it started with you telling me you wanted more insipiration
00:04:49 <ZK> Well, yeah, inspiration in general I think is a cool mechanic
00:05:08 <Camail> thne I said i really didn't want to, and was patient
00:05:08 <ZK> You agree with some principles of it, but think it's too powerful
00:05:12 <Camail> so now I'm 100% done
00:05:26 <Camail> i have other stuff to do with my time right now
00:05:50 <ZK> Sorry then.

16:29:56 <Camail> DoT`  i believe that versatile weapons are not considered two-handed for that specific property of monks because an unarmed strike is not done from a weapon. By defenition your strike is not a weapon. BUT things like armor and heavier 2h weapons restrict movement. Versatile would be a problem if you were try to use two weapons, but your body is not technically a weapon
