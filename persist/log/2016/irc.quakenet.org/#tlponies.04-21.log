00:04:04 <DuB`> Friggin' aced THAT test.
00:04:12 <DuB`> Dottttt.tttt...tt?? <3
00:04:12 * Dottttt hgs Dub
00:04:45 <DuB`> Test was an in-class, timed, difficult version of the flowcharts and vba excel stuff we did for our project.
00:04:48 <skram> dis your last d0b?
00:04:51 <DuB`> LAST
00:04:52 <DuB`> DONE
00:04:55 <skram> FREEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOOOOM
00:04:58 <DuB`> FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
00:05:05 <DuB`> GONNA
00:05:15 <DuB`> GONNA GET SET DUNGEON MASTERIES IN D3 FINALLY.
00:05:16 <DuB`> MEBBE.
00:05:26 <skram> bro
00:05:27 <skram> BRO
00:05:34 <skram> no d3 til next season
00:05:35 <skram> ITS THE LAW
00:05:36 <BioSkool> bro
00:05:41 <Bio> breh
00:05:43 <DuB`> Anyway, I was the first in the class of 50 people to finish the test and had everything at 100% working-ness.
00:05:47 <Bio> thats soon anyways
00:05:48 <DuB`> ?woop 
00:05:52 <skram> You are winner
00:05:53 <Dottttt> BioBro
00:06:07 <DuB`> skram: But... HC or no? That is the question. ;D
00:06:14 <Dottttt> HC always
00:06:20 <DuB`> Playing HC made it basically impossible to finish the season journey stuff, though. :T
00:06:25 <DuB`> I want fancy portraits.
00:06:26 <skram> HC always
00:06:33 <Camail> hc isnt fun as a game
00:06:36 <Camail> its fun as an experience
00:06:47 <Camail> but in terms of just having fun with the game itself, and not added value from the risk
00:06:49 <Camail> sc is better
00:06:50 <skram> diablo is much more fun when the threat of death looms above
00:06:56 <Camail> to some it is
00:07:01 <skram> personal preference sure
00:07:18 <Camail> if i was still really into the game i would play sc
00:07:23 <DuB`> Not being able to complete everything as far/fully is a pretty equal NEGATIVE, though.
00:07:24 <Camail> I like to take risks i hate playing saffe
00:07:28 <Camail> I haaaate playing safe
00:07:34 <skram> I just want DuB` to hold my hand when i do grifts way beyond my gear and get 1% survival bonuses
00:08:01 <DuB`> Heheh.
00:08:20 <DuB`> I didn't even get far in grifts this season because I NEVER got either of the two BiS weapons in ancient.

00:12:40 <DuB`> Next point, they did 4monkey 2lucio and we got wrecked.

02:06:16 <Camail> hmm
02:06:21 <Bio> put a pony in the fields
02:06:40 <Micen> would it just be a new sheet for my horse?
02:08:35 <Camail> I don't know, maybe
02:08:48 <Camail> hang on
02:19:52 <Camail> can you guys create your own cahracters or is it only me
02:20:12 <Camail> micen in your notes section you can right down that you have a horse and whats on them
02:20:56 <Camail> maybe in additional features&traits
02:20:58 <Camail> hmmm
02:22:14 <Camail> a riding horse has a str of 16
02:22:20 <Camail> so thats a lot of carrying capacity
02:22:29 <Camail> but you need to include your own weight
02:23:45 <Camail> oh
02:23:48 <Camail> kind of
02:24:02 <Camail> the info on r20 isnt as accurate or detailed
02:24:11 <Camail> you can afford a light horse
02:26:48 <Camail> I'm making it right now
02:28:50 <Camail> k I made a char sheet for it
02:29:33 <Camail> i put the basic info in, if there's any other details
02:35:57 <DuB`> Whew!
02:36:05 <DuB`> Wizard set dungeon masteries done.
02:36:11 <DuB`> Can put it down until next season, now.

02:56:22 <Camail> Micen you dont need to put the attack data for your weapons ont e horse
02:56:35 <Camail> in fact i dont want it there, just attacks the cahracter can use
02:57:42 <Micen> I only see the hoof attack on my horse's sheet
02:57:46 <Camail> also he's encumbered so he's gonna be pretty slow
02:57:51 <Camail> oh
02:57:57 <Camail> oh shit
02:58:08 <Camail> i edited the wrong sheet
02:59:27 <Camail> .tell skram can you recheck that your stats are ok i accidently changed them, i got most of them right but i forgot what your wisdom was
03:00:04 <Camail> i was using the wrong horse stats
03:00:11 <Camail> animals arent very well documented in dnd
03:01:16 <Camail> skram changed the name of his character

15:33:31 <DoT`> stream is cutting out every few seconds for me
15:34:50 <ZK> oooh micen apparently we had met each other beforehand
15:35:09 <DoT`> did you weird him out so he ran off?
15:35:14 <DoT`> then you stalked him here
15:37:03 <Micen> yep, you are big magical warlock who was goign towards this town of adventue and intrigue, so i decided to join you,  assuming i would make some kind offewr to help off set travel expenses with my bard skills or something like that
15:38:55 <Camail> ok so i created two seperate channels int he discord
15:39:03 <Camail> one for dnd, thats for basically everything
15:39:09 <Camail> i have also made a secrets channel
15:39:39 <Camail> if you ever want to have conversations away from other party members, or i have something to tell you that only happens to you, we'll go there
15:39:59 <Camail> it will only be for important stuff tho
15:40:36 <Camail> like if you check for a trap I'll just tell you in public chat what you find even though technically you are the only one who gets that info
15:41:16 <Camail> but if its an important trap or you find something else I will give you the option of telling  your party or not
15:43:23 <Camail> where is the skram man
15:44:01 <DoT`> he went to nap hours ago
15:44:05 <DoT`> hope he set an alarm

16:25:22 <skram> good evening boys
16:26:40 <Camail> DoT`  For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.
16:26:40 <Camail> Potion of healing 50 gp 1/2 lb.
