04:10:54 <Camail> i wanna plaaaay
04:11:06 <Camail> mot that solves so many problems
04:11:07 <Camail> other than
04:11:10 <Camail> the buttons
04:19:47 <motbob> i feel like that problem could be solved with some sort of hoof appendage
04:25:36 <Camail> so they have one normal hoof for the phone adapter, then a secondary hoof adapter for the other hoof?
04:25:55 <Camail> that would exist

09:55:05 <DoT`> you know skram, i would look at feats, but i dont think we will make the required 5th level at this rate
09:56:36 <skram> ya we need to finish the introduction asap and go fight some dragons or something asap
09:56:55 <skram> cant be in the town with micen cockblocking me like that
09:57:02 <DoT`> then accedentaly walk out leaving a certain 2 alone with it?
09:57:14 <DoT`> the dragon
09:57:47 <skram> what you want to befriend the dragon instead?
09:58:09 <DoT`> no, im talking about leaving 2 party members to fight it
09:58:18 <Phearlaptop> No skram you should romance the dragon
09:58:42 <skram> i do have proficiency in animal handling
09:58:58 <skram> im going to assume that dragon seduction falls under that
09:59:27 <Phearlaptop> Probably charisma actually, DnD dragons tend to have pretty much human level (in some cases higher) intelligence
10:00:00 <skram> i am not very charismatic
10:00:14 <Phearlaptop> Wear a pretty dress then
10:01:09 <DoT`> and skram remind me on thursday if i forget, we want to knock out not kill the poor half ork

16:59:48 <Camail> I feel like EVO is 100% responsible for salt becoming a general gaming term
17:00:24 <Camail> which is weird because i have to keep the context straight or confuse fgc salt and normal person salt
17:00:38 <Camail> which makes a lot of difference

21:49:08 <Camail> but i dont know if i change anything if itw ill fuck it up even more
21:49:11 <DoT`> production quality!
21:49:27 <skram> cant wait to draw dicks on it
21:49:36 <DoT`> and watch us die on it
21:49:49 <Camail> if you dont die in the map ur on now
21:49:57 <Camail> your sneak rolls were comically bad
21:49:59 <Camail> just sayin
21:50:04 <skram> FORESHADOWING?
21:50:18 <DoT`> i dont think its the sneak roll that will have caused it
21:50:20 <Camail> judging by your rolls you wouldnt know what a shadow even was
21:50:22 <Phearlock> This is now a sneaking mission
21:50:37 <skram> fair enough
21:50:56 <skram> i guess zekes temper tantrum kinda destroyed any attempt at stealthing
21:51:12 <Camail> maybe throwing things on the ground and shattering them makes noise
21:51:15 <Camail> who knows
21:51:19 <Camail> who really knows
21:51:21 <Camail> (I do)
21:51:23 <skram> such immersion

21:52:23 <Phearlock> The way the wind is blowing can have a pretty large effect on if someone can hear you outside.
21:53:22 <Camail> i pronounce this map :good enough
21:57:57 <Camail> The one thing that I'm surprised about as a dm, is that i thought i would be the kind of person to try and hint at the players if they are making mistakes, but 90% of the time it turns out you making mistakes means more of my prep gets used
21:58:11 <Camail> so I'm like...yea go ahead do the thing thats +10 minutes for me
