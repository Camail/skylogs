08:18:27 <Camail> get the expansion
08:19:36 <Camail> its a bit odd that they have witcher sets for level 34 but that's actually massivley overlevelled
08:30:22 <Camail> one annoying thing was that my ending said geralt was living from contract to contract, but juding by the cost of  room and board throughout the game and my end-game money situation, he must've formed some sort of drug habit to blow through all that money

12:27:49 <DoT`> seed thinks all races need nerf, very fair
12:29:35 <Yolteotl> I don't agree, I mean, each race have strong stuff, and it is fun. it's one reason why BW was fun
12:29:47 <Yolteotl> it would be silly to nerf strong stuff
12:29:55 <Yolteotl> but broken one need to be
12:31:29 <Yolteotl> adepts are almost fine (the -1 damage to 3 instead of 2-shot SCV/marines will be great), the issue is more warp prism + adept. 
12:32:28 <Yolteotl> warp prism  for 200-0 can warp, pick in a large radius, goes really fast
12:32:48 <Rawr|Phone> 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

22:56:09 <DuB`> No!
22:56:33 <DuB`> We got fresh snow today. :)
22:56:59 <DuB`> I wake up really early for work - it's fun being the only one on the roads and the first on the snow.
22:57:05 <DuB`> Slide around ALL the corners!
22:58:03 <DoT|Phone> first in snow is great
22:58:03 <ZK> was checking DBZ abridged for fun, and checked their patreon. They get 10k per month on that :o
23:01:55 <DoT|Phone> well that sounds nice
23:05:30 <DoT|Phone> dub. more sc2 please
23:09:21 <DuB`> Hardgame!
23:14:11 <Camail> ZK  they have like 4 full time people 
23:14:30 <Camail> + various others
23:14:46 <Camail> its great that they can live off it but its by no means comfortable
23:14:51 <DoT|Phone> excuses dub
23:15:15 <ZK> Still a lot of money in donations only, dunno how much they get from their youtube parternerships on their less known brands
23:15:26 <Camail> they cant make money off their dbz stuff
23:15:42 <ZK> why i said less known brands
23:15:50 <ZK> top patreon gets 55k per month, thats a lot
23:15:58 <Camail> yea
23:16:11 <Camail> its a decent site
23:16:40 <Camail> its the kickstarted effect, where you kinda have to uese the site to be genuine
23:16:54 <Camail> i wish they had their own system that didnt have patreon taking a cut
23:16:57 -!- Golly [~Golly@1.92-221-121.customer.lyse.net] has joined #tlponies
23:17:11 <Camail> they actually jsut recently changed the way they present the numbers
23:17:26 <Camail> before they showed how much was donated before the fees
23:17:36 <Camail> but now they take the cuts before the total amount is shown
23:17:38 <ZK> oh wow, patreon takes 5% and credit card fees cut 4-6%
23:17:56 <Camail> and then taxes, yay
23:18:55 <Camail> I love when people i dont like are mad, this douche in tlcsgo is arguing that the jumpthrow bind shouldnt be banned
23:19:20 <Camail> and I'm just sitting here relishing in his faux indignance
23:23:55 <reification> night tlp

23:34:45 <Camail> ok dub I'm dling d3, my hand feels better on ice, should be able to play for a bit
23:36:02 <DuB> Cool! Don't push yourself. :P
23:36:11 <DuB> Doesn't start for 2 hours or so yet.
23:40:01 <Camail> what class u playing
23:40:13 <DuB> Wizard!
23:40:16 <DuB> Heheh.
23:40:16 <Camail> gay
23:40:22 <Camail> i ahvent decided
23:40:30 <Camail> whats easiest for hc
23:40:43 <Camail> barb has bene the best historically
23:40:51 <Camail> but i dunno
23:41:58 <DuB> Good question.
23:42:14 <DuB> I know the strong one for Crus is literally a tank/thorns build.
23:42:16 * DuB shrugs.
23:43:07 <Camail> sadly i wont be able to DL the entire game so i wont get pretty textures
23:44:40 <DuB> D:
23:45:08 <DuB> I was surprised at just how much prettier it is with my new pc and 1920x1080.
23:46:49 <Camail> csgo with max settings actually looks pleasant
23:47:08 <DoT|Phone> more wizard prettyneas
23:47:18 <Camail> i cant wait until games start doing more that 60 fps
23:47:27 <Camail> 144 fps is the future, and it feels great
23:47:42 <Camail> people will vomit when they play 30 fps someday
