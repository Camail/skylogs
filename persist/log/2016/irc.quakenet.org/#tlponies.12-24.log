17:00:55 <ZK> my streaming skills gone bad, none of my audio is working like i want
17:00:55 <Yolteotl> it depends, better to do it on the choke
17:01:12 <Yolteotl> get some supply depot, marines, SCVs
17:01:32 <ZK> so drop on the ramp? or like between two barracks?
17:02:25 <Yolteotl> it depends, you have to find the best place to do it : P
17:02:35 <Yolteotl> some maps are very good for the ramp
17:02:40 <ZK> ooooook
17:02:58 <Yolteotl> I just do it for like a year, and when I'm good, I win.
