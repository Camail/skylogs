01:55:07 <DoT`> runbunny, how goes your dingy soul?
01:56:18 <Runbunny> It's pretty good. I am sorta waiting on you now.
01:56:24 <DoT`> oh
01:56:27 <Runbunny> Did you defeat quelagg?
01:56:35 <DoT`> i have to still kill spider
01:56:40 <Runbunny> Yeh.
01:56:58 <DoT`> its a long fight, i can only see 1 animation where its safe to attack
01:57:07 <DoT`> all the vomit
01:57:45 <Runbunny> I'm looking forward to you struggle through Sen's fortress and Anor Londo.
01:58:08 <DoT`> im glad you enjoy my suffering
01:58:20 <Runbunny> well it's safe to attack on many of her attacks, but you can probably only get 1 or 2 swings in.
01:58:37 <DoT`> its just such a pain to get back to spider, all that water
01:59:00 <Runbunny> Yeah.. You don't have the rusty iron ring :D
01:59:01 <DoT`> thats if you know the timings
01:59:24 <DoT`> well again, i dont know all the things that someone who has played before does :/
01:59:37 <Runbunny> indeed.
01:59:43 <Runbunny> you're screwed.
02:00:06 <Runbunny> You could easy mode and just summon mildred to help you.
02:00:29 <Runbunny> How strong is your weapon?
02:00:33 <DoT`> thats like cheating D:  and my humanity is sitting with my souls in the spider den
02:00:52 <DoT`> +5 saber
02:01:02 <Runbunny> Still going with the saber?
02:01:04 <Runbunny> hm.
02:01:13 <DoT`> well i dont know whats good
02:01:28 <DoT`> and no shards to upgrade another weapon yet
02:01:37 <Runbunny> true.
02:02:03 <Runbunny> You can buy titanite shards from the blacksmith, for 800 souls a piece.
02:02:49 <DoT`> another 3 deaths to spider and i will have to go buy some the anti poisen stuff
02:03:01 <DoT`> so might go past there then
02:03:06 <Runbunny> How are your stats?
02:03:12 <DoT`> a mess
02:03:36 <DoT`> i cant recall atm, my dex is high, working on vit
02:03:59 <DoT`> i did get some risistance that  i know read was useless but its fine
02:04:06 <Runbunny> what about armor? maybe you could benefit from more defense.
02:04:15 <DoT`> i have 8 faith still
02:04:40 <DoT`> armour i have wondere, chest i upgraded and pants i changed to a red dress
02:08:11 <DoT`> i see things with better physical defence, but wonderer has a nice spread 
02:08:54 <Runbunny> Quelagg is weak to lightning. if that is any help.
02:09:31 <DoT`> ive only had 2 runs at her, still getting the timnig of everythning
02:09:42 <DoT`> 3 technicly
02:09:59 <DoT`> but the first i had no vials and only 1 mm of health
02:10:20 <DoT`> :P
02:11:09 <Crisium> omg theres a ZvZ with a queen
02:11:15 <Crisium> its been years since i seen this

12:09:39 <DoT`> or at least i havnt found one yet
12:09:50 <Runbunny> you should explore firelink some more.
12:10:05 <Runbunny> plenty of secrets.
12:10:28 <DoT`> there was a silent women in a cell by goldie
12:10:33 <DoT`> she is gone now and it says dead

12:11:05 <DoT`> like would she have talked for anything? 
12:12:20 <Runbunny> Check the bonfire.

12:16:09 <Runbunny> Yeah..
12:16:19 <Runbunny> So someone killed the fire keeper.
12:16:29 <Runbunny> Did you find anything at her corpse?
12:16:34 <DoT`> its a land of undead!

12:24:24 <DoT`> the games a bit frustrating, sometimes it leads you by the hand others it exoects you to guess, and you never know which its doing
12:32:13 <Runbunny> no no you don't need the orb equipped.

13:44:48 <DoT`> spiffing i fell through the floor into a boss fight
14:03:44 <Rawr|Fone> Sk√§rpning
14:12:13 <DoT`> rawr, hows you
14:12:36 <Rawr|Fone> Good good
14:12:43 <Rawr|Fone> Playing table tennis soon
14:13:08 <Cane> And so begins the adventures of The Speedrunner, an Engi cruiser piloted by Rawr and crewed by Dot and Runbunny. I promise not to die in the first sector.
14:13:26 <DoT`> woohoo!
14:13:38 <DoT`> cake or death! is my battle cry
14:14:59 <Cane> We begin with a pirate hunt, apparently.
14:15:09 <Cane> Ion Cannons are OP though so they kind of fell apart after a while.
14:16:36 <Cane> Ok, I found a ship with no shields. I am currently Ion Bursting their weapons so they can't hurt us. Gonna go AFK and let Runbunny the weapons expert level up for a bit.
14:16:53 <DoT`> such sppedrun

14:17:29 <Yolteotl> Franceeee
14:17:33 <Cane> Yoooolt. <3
14:17:37 <Yolteotl> :p
14:17:41 <Cane> You're too late to be a crewmember on board my FTL ship.
14:17:47 <Cane> But if I find another one that can be you.
14:17:55 <Yolteotl> Hi dot!<3
14:17:56 <Cane> Anyway, AFK while Runbunny levels up on this drone ship.
14:18:14 <DoT`> drone ships i would say are the hardest
14:19:48 <Cane> Yeah, the Engi ships are hard to start out with because they just have ion blasters and deal all their damage using drones.
14:19:54 <Cane> And they start with like a level 1 combat drone.
14:19:56 <Cane> Which is butt.
14:20:08 <Cane> So whenever I find a ship that can't hurt me, I definitely spend some time leveling up my crew.
14:20:34 <Cane> Runbunny is most of the way there.
14:20:48 <Cane> I'll level up Dot too in case Runbunny dies and I need a new guy on weapons.
14:22:24 <Cane> Almost there.
14:22:36 <Cane> Yay! Runbunny is master artillery gunner.
14:23:26 <Cane> So the next two crewmembers that I get will be Yolt and Bio.
14:24:29 <Runbunny> I knew I was a master.
14:28:13 <Yolteotl> :D
14:28:24 <Yolteotl> Poor dayshi
14:28:30 <skram> master of weird-ass animus maybe, anders
14:29:23 <Runbunny> Your envy is keeping me warm at night Jonas.
14:29:30 <skram> :3
14:30:07 <DoT`> angel i keep getting stuck in its legs :/
14:30:15 <skram> send me pictures of your 15k dollar figurine collection will you
14:30:29 <Cane> Alrighty, Dot levelled and Runbunny is a master. Time to kill this thing.
14:31:53 <Cane> Sigh, I found another ship I can train on.
14:32:00 <Cane> This one only has a single pew gun so it can't break shields.
14:32:03 <Cane> Time to level evasion.
14:32:17 <Cane> AFK.
14:35:15 <Rawr|Fone> Beep beep
14:40:32 <Cane> Rawr is now an expert pilot.

14:56:20 <DoT`> FIRE!
14:56:53 <Cane> Dot says yes.
14:56:55 <Cane> We have a fire drone now.
14:57:14 <DuB`> :D
14:57:42 <DoT`> i can just here the fire minions from Overlord saying "Fire, fire, fiire"

15:00:01 <DuB`> Whoops.
15:03:20 <Cane> We just killed a ship by taking its oxygen. That is way too much fun in FTL. <3
15:03:25 <Cane> So much scrap.
15:11:46 <Cane> OH DEARS.
15:11:48 <Cane> Giant spiders.
15:12:03 <Cane> Welp, no blue options. Dot, Rawr, do you want to take the chance or get the hell out of dodge?
15:13:37 <DoT`> take a chance! unless our glorious captina decides otherwise
15:14:09 <Cane> We freaking beat it!
15:14:17 <Cane> We survived the alien spiders DoT`!
15:14:22 <Cane> This is a day for celebrations.
15:14:27 <DoT`> huzzah!
15:21:21 <DoT`> lol snake ppl op
15:21:50 <Cane> We were in such a bad way for like two fights there, we couldn't beat them at all. Had to run.
15:21:57 <Cane> And then I found a store that had a beam drone mk II.
15:21:59 <Cane> Now EVERYTHING DIES.
15:27:49 <Cane> DoT`, this pirate is trying to surrender. Their offering is pathetic.
15:28:26 <DoT`> oh dear
15:28:28 <DoT`> poor them
15:29:27 <Cane> Okay. Crew teleporter and pick up more crewmembers along the way, or Pike Beam/Flak combo?
15:29:46 <Cane> The Flak II is ridiculously fun.
15:29:56 <DoT`> that is a nice combo, but you kinda need tele  for thew boss
15:30:05 <DoT`> hmmmm
15:30:07 <Cane> Yeeeah, I'll get the teleporter.
15:36:11 <Cane> Solar Flare, Ion/Pike Beam Zoltan Cruiser with shields, and me without my full set of weapons.
15:36:12 <Cane> Halp

15:48:14 <Cane> DoT`, chance it again?

16:25:51 <DoT`> Bjorn shall avenge his twim, clone, brother
16:30:43 <Cane> And thus ends our run through space. Exploded by swarms of missiles.
16:31:05 <Cane> We were down to just Rawr manning the helm, pewpewing with a single weapon that couldn't break through shields.

16:31:20 <Cane> Now that I've played the worst ship, I'm going to become broken.
16:31:23 <Cane> Playing Crystal B.
16:31:31 <Cane> That starts with a 4-man teleporter and cloaking device.
16:31:32 <Runbunny> It sure is Dot.
16:31:46 <Phearlock> Just don't get too many drones =)
16:32:10 <Cane> I was playing the Engi ship, I had no choice. =D
16:32:23 <Phearlock> Oh I meant hostile drones

21:19:34 <Runbunny> Yay.
21:23:10 <DoT`> rip rip already
21:24:05 <Runbunny> Where does your sadness take you?
21:24:17 <DoT`> snake ppl
21:24:27 <Runbunny> Right.
21:24:34 <DoT`> but maybe i should go look at those runes past the drake valley
21:24:48 <DoT`> sneks and axes is being silly
21:25:06 <Runbunny> It's the test dot.
21:25:28 <DoT`> i dont even know what i am suppose to be doing lol
21:25:31 <DoT`> i rung the bells
21:25:35 <Runbunny> Yeah.
21:25:42 <DoT`> that someoen said could be rung to open something
21:25:52 <DoT`> so i went to do it with no real reason
21:25:57 <DoT`> now im like OK
21:26:03 <Runbunny> Did you check firelink?
21:26:13 <Runbunny> There was snoring and snorting?
21:26:17 <DoT`> the one that cant be used?
21:26:27 <DoT`> didnt do anything like that for me
21:26:56 <DoT`> there is no story in this game to get context clues on what i shoul dbe doing
21:27:04 <Bio> pon
21:27:07 <Bio> hello
21:27:09 <Runbunny> There is you just missed them :P
21:27:10 <DoT`> Bayu
21:27:23 <Bio> dot lets shoot bullets
21:27:26 <DoT`> i talked to everyone i coud find 
21:27:27 <Bio> I have like 5 missions
21:27:28 <Runbunny> anyhoo... check firelink on the path to the catacombs.
21:27:44 <DoT`> you mean the one that wont light?
21:28:22 <DoT`> latest death was hit by lightning causing me to stagger 1 step 
21:28:31 <DoT`> i get knocked to the ground by a swining axe
21:28:40 <DoT`> into the path of another axe 
21:28:42 <Runbunny> Yes. That place is called Firelink Shrine. Current your has gone out, since the Keeper is dead.
21:28:46 <DoT`> that sweeps me off while i am standing up
21:28:59 <Runbunny> Welcome to Dark Souls.
21:29:11 <DoT`> will in 5 minutes bio
21:29:25 <DoT`> just triyng to get clear here that DS seems to have no purpose!
21:29:47 <DoT`> if you dont stumble into the correct conversation piece of furniture apparently it leaves you lost
21:31:46 <DoT`> jimmy who talked about a stench is gone from there now
21:31:50 <DoT`> no snoring or snortling
21:32:04 <Runbunny> well the crestfallen guy at firelink shrine tells you about the bells. and roughly what way to go.
21:32:07 <Runbunny> Yeah
21:32:21 <Runbunny> Then go check where the stench is coming from.
21:32:49 <DoT`> that could be anywhere i have been or havnt been
21:33:11 <DoT`> i just decided castle as its what opend when i rung the bells
21:33:14 <Runbunny> if he could smell it in firelink, it must mean that it is in firelink.
21:33:18 <DoT`> fortress*
21:33:33 <DoT`> depends how strong the smell is
21:33:38 <Runbunny> head towards the graveyard. then you should se it.
21:33:40 <Runbunny> see*
21:33:53 <DoT`> there is now a thing there
21:33:58 <DoT`> there wasnt the first time
21:34:14 <DoT`> becuase i went through there to the graveyard and back after talking to stench guy
21:34:32 <Runbunny> It appears after you ring the bells. since you wake it up.
21:34:41 <Runbunny> Enjoy Frampt the Kingseeker.
21:34:55 <Runbunny> btw he is the guy that you can sell things to.
21:35:44 <DoT`> i rung the bells -> found the dead firelink -=> talked to everyone -> went ALL over firelink trying to use the firelink tihngs
21:35:49 <DoT`> then went to the asylum
21:36:02 <DoT`> back all over firelink, then off to the jungle/fort
21:36:15 <DoT`> he takes a long time to show
21:38:55 <Runbunny> well did frampt tell you where to go?
21:39:11 <DoT`> yes! finaly i have direction
21:39:20 <DoT`> no clue what direction its in but it will do
21:45:24 <DoT`> i wonder why he took so long to appear
21:46:48 <Runbunny> Spoilers: he was sleeping.
21:46:56 <DoT`> haah
21:47:08 <DoT`> i mean why after i rung the bells ot took so long
21:48:20 <Runbunny> It's probably your lack of skills.
