02:28:01 <DuB`> Ooooooh.
02:28:22 <DuB`> Anyone know why they land it on a ship, anyway?
02:28:32 <DuB`> Seems like it'd be more difficult by a lot.
02:28:36 <Phearlaptop> More options for landing.
02:28:44 <DoT`> it landed safe?
02:28:47 <Phearlaptop> Yes
02:28:54 <DoT`> nice!
02:29:16 <Phearlaptop> https://youtu.be/RPGUQySBikQ standard view
02:29:20 <DuB`> Options as in location?
02:29:35 <Phearlaptop> Yeah and you don't need as much fuel
02:29:51 <DoT`> cant believe i missed a successful landing, dammit
02:30:31 <Phearlaptop> As boosting back to land after launching over the ocean needs a larger Dv expenditure than just adjusting at the end of a ballistic trajectory.
02:31:07 <Phearlaptop> But yeah they'd probably prefer to be able to land it on land everytime.
02:31:22 <Phearlaptop> But being able to put it down on barges gives them more places to launch from
02:31:58 <DuB`> Interesting.
02:32:34 <Phearlaptop> I like how the barges are named after ships in sci-fi books.
02:32:52 <Phearlaptop> SpaceX are really a bunch of nerds
02:33:21 <DoT`> they are very good at naming things

10:27:28 <Lynda> much easier to retain med interactions like this
10:28:26 <Lynda> just scary to think that a lot of clinics and pharmacies lack software or access to online pay-only software that contain med interactions, and most doctors and pharmacists won't know most interactions themselves
10:29:19 <Lynda> (and those interactions so far are just for /one/ enzyme - CYP3A4)
10:29:40 <Cane> Well, shit, I found an anime I really like and want to see more of. That doesn't usually happen.

13:17:07 <Cane> Today, I beat Batman: Arkham Asylum on hard difficulty without ever taking a hit from an enemy or hazard. Winner.
13:17:46 <DoT`> well done
13:17:56 <DoT`> now dark souls!
13:18:17 <Cane> Maybe I should!
13:19:01 <DoT`> i havnt even just finished the game >.>
13:19:33 <DoT`> but there is happy hobbit who has done it no gettign hit, and for months ow has been trying to do a every boss run without being hot
13:19:42 <DoT`> stressfull stream to watch
13:20:37 <Cane> Oh man, sounds like it.
13:22:23 <DoT`> he streams every day form like 10/11 pm till 6/7 am
13:22:26 <DoT`> such bad times for me
13:26:53 <DoT`> how long did it take you cane?
13:28:53 <Cane> Just a few days, it's an intuitive combat system.
13:29:13 <Cane> Stealth sections are the hardest to do without *dying*, especially on hard difficulty.
13:29:30 <Cane> Fun game though, AAA titles aren't usually my thing but Arkham Asylum is great.
13:30:19 <DoT`> hmm, i recall i tihnk that game had a rather large backlash on release with issues everywhere
13:30:33 <DoT`> then they brought out a massive patch and ppl seemed happy
13:31:48 <Cane> Arkham Asylum? All the Batman games were at least slightly buggy on release, but the only one that was nuked from orbit was Batman: Arkham Knight.
13:32:02 <Cane> That one they actually pulled from stores.
13:33:02 <DoT`> oh ya, lol
13:33:13 <DoT`> they have simler names >.>
13:34:00 <DoT`> what AAA game comes out nowdays without bugs :/
13:36:49 <ZK> Overwatch hopefully? :D
13:41:08 <Saurabhinator> anyone wanna watch attack on titan s2 e1 with me
13:41:45 <DoT`> oh s2 is out?
13:41:52 <Phearlock> Yeah I should try finish at least Dark souls 1.
13:41:55 <Phearlock> I never got very far lol
13:42:05 <DoT`> i not sure i recall enough of s1
13:42:07 <ZK> Same as you phear!
13:42:12 <ZK> i should try harder
13:42:25 <Saurabhinator> http://horriblesubs.info/shows/kabaneri-of-the-iron-fortress
13:42:34 <Saurabhinator> here it is
13:44:17 <Saurabhinator> https://youtu.be/cbxfXbs9Mpo
13:44:21 <Saurabhinator> trailer for it
13:45:16 <Saurabhinator> DoT`: (it's joke it's nto actually attack on titan)
13:45:41 <Saurabhinator> its just a show which is made by same people and has identical premise
13:46:06 <DoT`> i was getting confused
13:46:11 <DoT`> as nothing looked right
13:48:52 <Cane> Saura, I just watched that today.
13:48:55 <Cane> <Cane> Well, shit, I found an anime I really like and want to see more of. That doesn't usually happen.
13:49:27 <Cane> And of course it happens with a completely new show that has exactly 1 episode out. Instead of, say, an established show with tons of seasons.
13:49:43 <Phearlock> lol
13:49:54 <Phearlock> Bad luck there =)
13:53:21 <Cane> I'm just a sucker for steampunk.
13:55:08 <Phearlock> Didn't actualy end up hearding if you got your pedals in the end Cane
13:55:21 <Cane> Oh yeah, they're here. <3

23:26:29 <skram> Not sure if I did finish bl2
23:26:39 <Micen|Streaming> I havent even finished bl1
23:27:20 <skram> I think I did, but havent played the pirate dlc
23:27:40 <skram> BL1 was pretty good but got pretty grindy
23:27:54 <skram> the sequels were a lot better
23:28:03 <DoT`> pirate was pretty fun
23:29:14 <DoT`> BL1 had zombie island!
23:29:26 <DoT`> and TK baha!
23:29:29 <skram> Oh yeah. The Zed thing
23:30:32 <DoT`> im sad about tk
23:31:50 <DuB`> I have all the BLs on steam, haven't played them much. :o
23:31:53 <DoT`> micen, you should use the Paint full tool
23:31:57 <DoT`> its much quicker
23:32:03 <Micen|Streaming> wont hit right
23:32:04 <DoT`> wtf dub
23:32:10 <Micen|Streaming> because sketchy outline
23:32:10 <DuB`> DoT`

23:32:15 <DoT`> Duuuuuub
23:32:24 <DuB`> Because I had played 1 + 2 on ps4 before, already.
23:32:26 <skram> also dot swore
23:32:29 <DoT`> i dont have 1, but i have a friend who does
23:32:30 <Micen|Streaming> and i am having fun rocking out to some Tenacious D
23:32:36 <DoT`> maybe i should steal his account 
23:32:41 <DuB`> And the prequel one was... I dunno couldn't get into it as much.
23:32:46 <skram> I like the presequel more than bl2 honestly
23:32:51 <DuB`> Would enjoy playing a BL with tlp.
23:33:20 <DuB`> Oh wait, I did beat the prequel one's first playthrough.
23:33:22 <DuB`> Ok.
23:34:17 <DoT`> i didnt finish the presequal
23:34:25 <DoT`> i blaeme austrlain accents
23:34:30 <DuB`> Hahaha
23:34:41 <skram> noobs
23:34:49 <DuB`> I did get a bit tired of the setting/landscape.
23:34:52 <DuB`> GREY
23:34:54 <DuB`> MOON
23:34:55 <DuB`> YEY
23:35:34 <DuB`> Also my character wasn't as fun as zer0 from bl2 so it never felt as good.
23:35:44 <DuB`> Maaan he was fun.
23:35:52 <skram> Siren 4ever bro
23:36:10 <skram> There are no good DLCs for pre-sequel though :|
23:36:23 <DoT`> skram knows whats up
23:36:30 <DoT`> Sirens <3
23:37:04 <DoT`> no siren in pre sequal so played shield person
23:37:16 <DuB`> Same.
23:37:50 <skram> i was pistol lady
23:37:55 <DoT`> friend played lawbringer person
23:37:56 <DoT`> so op
23:38:01 <DoT`> that one skram
23:38:14 <DuB`> Athena is limited to fast fire rate fire and lightning stuff. :T
23:38:33 <skram> you say that like its a bad thing
23:39:01 <DuB`>  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
23:39:01 <DoT`> i enjoyed athena, but pistol lady is so strong
23:39:12 <DuB`> Also I still have like 100 of the golden keys.
23:39:14 <DoT`> i like baance skram D:
23:39:21 <DuB`> I could just go get OP guns every few levels.
23:39:29 <DoT`> i had many keys but stopped collecting
23:39:52 <DoT`> its boring when you do that :/
23:39:58 <DoT`> its like D3 auction house
23:40:09 <DoT`> easy op items
23:40:12 <skram> Yeah having 200 golden keys kinda ruined it a bit
23:40:14 <DoT`> boring
23:41:10 <DuB`> The fact that there was only one +100% melee damage gun in bl2 was kinda funny.
23:41:26 <DuB`> As a max-level zer0 using like a lv14 gun.
23:42:39 <DuB`off> Going to a friend's place for a while.
23:42:49 <DuB`off> Socializing DansGame WutFace
