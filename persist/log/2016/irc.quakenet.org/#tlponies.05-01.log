20:22:08 <Rawr|Fone> I almost turned it off when he suicided phear
20:22:42 <Rawr|Fone> Up 2-1 in stocks and just dying off the edge
20:23:41 <Phearlock> oh god sounds terrifying
20:24:35 <Rawr|Fone> Leffen didn't even do anything, axe was just wavedashing to grab the ledge over and over again
20:24:41 <Rawr|Fone> And managed to die
20:24:52 <Phearlock> Not the first one to do so
20:25:00 <Phearlock> The edge is scary
20:26:59 <DoT`> gg huk

22:21:48 <Phearlock> Ooooof, Mango strong. Good match
22:22:59 <Camail> yea, now i kinda think the rest of the players got shafted with their hooks, but i was trying to be hands off
22:23:28 <Camail> I'm the story teller i should be the one telling the story >_>
22:23:30 <Camail> lesson learned
22:23:49 <ZK> huh?
22:24:28 <DoT`> we are clearly cams gunie pigs
22:24:32 <Camail> i wrote nice little short stories to compliments their hooks
22:24:37 <Camail> phears and dubs
22:24:45 <Phearlock> It was really nice
22:24:57 <Camail> I was originally afraid to dip my toes in other peoples characters
22:25:18 <Camail> but I'm already controlling their fates anyway so yea
22:25:50 <Camail> also dub and phear depending on how much you've opened up to each other you can share your version of the back story with each other
22:31:16 <Phearlock> I sent some PMs
22:31:18 <Phearlock> =P

22:34:03 <Camail> noty
22:34:10 <Bio> can't have no in your heart
22:34:14 <Camail> well, ~15 years
22:34:35 <ZK> DMing is hard
22:35:01 <ZK> I'm lazy, so I want to work with improvised DMing, but dunno how good I'd be at that
22:36:12 <DoT`> would every npc be autistic?
22:36:15 <Phearlock> I like how Camail has been doing so far (from watching the stream).
22:36:27 <Camail> you need to have core NPCs and a semi-fleshed out world or else you have nothing to improvise on
22:36:29 <Phearlock> Good pacing
22:37:02 <Phearlock> (inb4 me and dub ruin it by adding 2 players)
22:37:05 <Camail> also improv as DM is extremely hard because of the sheer amount of information you would need to remember
22:37:17 <Camail> you would forget half the shit you said
22:37:21 <Camail> but the players will never forget
22:37:22 <Camail> ever
22:37:53 <Phearlock> Oh boy m2k

22:59:41 <Camail> write a short bio
22:59:52 <Bio> yeh, a tall bio is me
23:00:03 <Camail> the PHB says that a wizard has to have an important magical moment that put them on this path
23:00:18 <Camail> start from there, create a family, a school, name a town
23:00:19 <DoT`> rawr http://imgur.com/gallery/ccV3Eff
23:00:29 <Camail> dont be an orphan
23:01:07 <Rawr|Phone> :3
23:01:32 <DuB`> Uhhhhhh.
23:01:54 <Camail> name a twon as in pick a town
23:02:25 <Camail> look up a forgotten realms map, the adventure is in the northwest, but you dont have to be from a town there
23:02:43 <Phearlock> I went as far as picking a nearby town that I could confirm had a temple of the faith I wanted my paladin to have grown up with.
23:02:52 <Phearlock> But like, yeah, that's not required =P
23:03:43 <DuB`> What if...
23:03:46 <DuB`> Orphan? :P
23:03:46 <Camail> no
23:04:17 <DuB`> From age 15 or so...
23:04:27 <Camail> write it down in word
23:04:31 <Camail> send me the first draft
23:04:36 <Camail> it doesnt have to be long at all
23:04:43 <DuB`> Yah.
23:04:48 <Camail> everyone is doing around 1 paragraph at most
23:04:51 <Phearlock> I wrote like a paragraph
23:05:28 <Rawr|Phone> Mango was playing so well and then just died
23:06:21 <Phearlock> I still think he got this
23:06:36 <Rawr|Phone> Probably

23:13:13 <Phearlock> Again!
23:13:24 <Rawr|Phone> So good
23:14:31 <ZK> oh, and back to improv mode DM, it's cooperative storytelling so really different. Having well grounded NPCs can be important, but at the end of the day, the PC decide if that NPC will end up being important. But yea, lots of notes, and readying battles is important, but I would want to try cooperative storyelling improv DMing. But not at that level quite yet.
23:15:58 <Phearlock> The technology.
23:16:47 <ZK> Camail this my dragon familiar http://imgur.com/SwVD0MB
23:16:59 <Phearlock> awwww
23:17:12 <Phearlock> And ooooo
23:17:16 <Rawr|Phone> Omg
23:17:20 <Rawr|Phone> That was so good
23:17:34 <Phearlock> extremely
23:18:44 <Camail> zk does it need a sheet?
23:21:41 <ZK> .I don't think so? Its stats never change
23:22:05 <ZK> its basically a glorified scout that can die at any moment, then be revived with an hour long ritual
23:28:47 <Camail> k
23:33:41 <Camail> oh also I've been doing xp wrong so yea if the numbers start to seem smaller going onwards, thats why
23:34:03 <Camail> once we get into the main storyline everyone SHOULD be lvl 3
23:36:06 <ZK> hmm, what was the error?
23:38:41 <Camail> i was going by the adjusted xp, not the actual xp
23:39:48 <Camail> i skipped that sentence while reading about xp, apparently
23:41:36 <DoT`> tsk tsk
23:41:51 <ZK> reading into adjusted vs encoutner xp, i dont get it that much
23:42:59 <ZK> ooooooh ok got it
23:43:18 <ZK> its to help you determine the difficulty of encounter, not the xp given to players. got it
