00:30:06 <DuB`> Hweeooooo.
00:31:09 <Dot_> zk, whe nyou going to stream again
00:31:16 <Camail> dub go away
00:31:20 <DuB`> :T
00:31:21 <Camail> dot go practice shootbangs
00:31:23 <ZK> probly when school isnt as invading
00:31:25 <ZK> maybe two weeks?
00:31:27 <Dot_> NOO
00:31:29 <Dot_> dab stay
00:31:30 <ZK> i have spring break then
00:31:38 <DuB`study> It's okay, dot. I study at my desk. :P
00:31:49 <DuB`study> Cam can't chase me off that easily!
00:32:04 <Camail> i did tho
00:32:10 <Dot_> i drew the head of a pony! art was done
00:32:11 <Camail> also u r the biggest nerd
00:32:15 <ZK> well, no hes still here
00:32:21 <ZK> ergo you didnt chase him away
00:32:33 <Camail> he came back
00:32:35 <Camail> obv
00:32:36 <Camail> nerd
00:32:47 <DuB`study> Dot I want to see ponyhead.
00:33:14 <ZK> dot is stlll only drawing circles
00:33:19 <Dot_> tricky, i have no camra 
00:33:27 <Dot_> ponies head is a circle
00:34:42 <DuB`study> I think I drew a paint pony with only circles/ovals once.
00:34:50 <Dot_> cam, strafe stopping to shoot thing is hard
00:35:08 <Camail> you get used to it
00:35:20 <Camail> i dont even consciously do it anymore
00:35:36 <Camail> you just tap the other direction
00:35:43 <Dot_> when peaking is it just aaaaa ddddd  and you shoot at the moment movment stops
00:35:49 <Dot_> or aaaaaa d   shoot
00:35:52 <Dot_> then move back
00:35:53 <Camail> that
00:35:58 <Camail> latter
00:36:01 <Camail> well
00:36:04 <Camail> it depends on waht you're doing
00:36:07 <Dot_> ok
00:36:11 <Camail> if you are peeking for information you never stop
00:36:17 <Camail> sometimes you even have your knife out
00:36:38 <Camail> if you are peeking to engage then yes you hold a, then tap d
00:36:59 <Camail> also crouching after strafing is a thing
00:37:18 <Camail> and you're accuracy is the same crouch strafing as it is staying still
00:37:20 <Dot_> i recall you tyelling me to not get into a crouching habbit
00:37:22 <Camail> thats a popular technique
00:37:30 <Dot_> telling*
00:37:46 <Camail> never move around crouched
00:37:49 <Camail> or peek crouched
00:38:12 <Dot_> what about recoil?
00:38:15 <DuB`study> OooOOooooberwaaaj~
00:38:21 <Camail> crouching is useful because it quickly changed where your head is in the middle of a spray fight
00:38:29 <Camail> whata bout recoil?
00:38:34 <Camail> it doesnt change recoil
00:38:38 <Dot_> ok
00:38:44 <Camail> it lowers your crosshair
00:38:47 <Dot_> didnt think so, but tohugh tto check
00:38:55 <Camail> but it doesnt change the pattern at all

00:59:35 <Camail> ryu is angry
00:59:42 <Camail> because he's balding
01:04:56 <Camail> lmao people saying znagief isnt scary
01:05:02 <Camail> bitch has a fucking vacuum
01:05:16 <Camail> he can combo into his super after v trigger
01:06:02 <Camail> air spd
01:06:05 <Camail> I mean, the fuck you want
01:06:08 <Camail> fucking armor parries
01:06:13 <Camail> jesus christ he's terrifying
01:06:32 <Camail> oh no he doesnt get 50/50s after every SPD oh noooo
01:06:33 <Camail> =/
01:06:56 <Bio> i'm triggered
01:10:19 <Crisium> lol
01:10:36 <Crisium> i think mika and birdie are better than gief
01:10:55 <Crisium> but gief still induced that fear
01:13:43 <Camail> I've heard mika is meh
01:14:16 <Camail> mika's v trigger isn't very good 
01:21:48 <Micen_> Hello.
01:27:31 <Dot_> Hey micen
01:27:48 <Micen> What are you doing now Dot?
01:27:54 <Micen> and why is it not more art?
01:28:02 <Dot_> sleep soon
01:28:17 <Micen> So. Use art to meditate and wind down.
01:28:23 <DuB`study> DoT did you see the crank sc2+hearthstone vid?
01:28:32 <DuB`study> Too gooooood.
01:31:30 <Camail> Crisium  also backdashes arent invincible so gief is even stronger, as the only pure grappler
01:34:11 <Dot_> crank streams are great dub
01:35:01 <Crisium> birdie is a grappler who zones
01:35:03 <Crisium> very scary
01:36:10 <Camail> he has a command grab
01:36:13 <Camail> doesnt mean he's a grappler
01:36:40 <Camail> he's a hybrid character, but i dont think he's better than gief
01:37:38 <Camail> armor parries as a grappler is just so fuckinf godlike
01:37:48 <Camail> he has another tool designed to make you not press buttons
01:38:30 <Camail> after a few months bridie is never gonna hit he dive grab
01:38:45 <Camail> its gonna be a low crush thing
