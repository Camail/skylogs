01:04:20 <DoT`> bio
01:16:14 <Camail> bio y u no shoots
01:16:30 <DoT`> ya bio
01:17:38 <Cane> Steam just recommended The Bureau: X-COM Declassified to me.
01:17:46 <Cane> I had to take Steam out behind the shed and shoot it. Sorry everyone.
01:19:19 <Camail> steam knows what's best for you
01:20:16 <Cane> That made me curious though: What is the worst game I own on Steam, the one I'm embarrassed I ever bought?
01:20:28 <Runbunny> poor steam. that reminds me that Gaben never responded to my email about removing VR products from the store reel thingy.
01:22:13 <Runbunny> Mine is probably "Sniper: Ghost Warrior" :/
01:24:33 <Camail> for me its arma 2, but only because the only reason i got it was for DayZ and only played it for 5 minutes because dayz is garbage
01:25:14 <Cane> I'm not sure what mine would be, to be honest. My hatred for Divinity: Original Sin is a personal and subjective one.
01:25:27 <Cane> But I suppose that's the one that made me the angriest.
01:26:01 <Cane> Oh. I guess I did buy Magicka 2.
01:26:27 <Camail> I've never been a person who buys bundles or stuff like that, i only have 103 games
01:26:35 <Camail> i never bought magicka 2
01:26:46 <Camail> saw reviews, then kinda didnt bother
01:27:38 <Camail> thought its probably not as bad as trine 3
01:27:45 <Camail> which I have heard is dog shit
01:27:46 <Cane> You're smarter than me, then.
01:27:56 <Cane> I think I got Magicka because we wanted to do it for Co-Op Coins.
01:28:04 <Cane> And then it was just kinda bleh.

01:29:39 <Cane> OH FUCK
01:29:52 <Cane> I just saw I have Shadow of Mordor that I got gifted for christmas and I still haven't played it.
01:29:54 <Cane> I'm a bad friend.
01:30:01 <Cane> I forgot I had this bloody thing.
01:31:38 <Phearlock> More twi Bio? https://derpiboo.ru/1135263
01:32:03 <Phearlock> I certainly need more
01:33:07 <Camail> oh god, SoM
01:33:27 <Micen> SoM was fun when i played it
01:33:31 <Camail> I was considering that for worst game in my library exclusively for the ending
01:33:46 <Micen> didnt get that far, really?
01:34:00 <Camail> worst ending of a game I've ever personally played
01:34:09 <Micen> also, my worst game in library easily goes to Napoleon: Total war.
01:34:16 <Camail> the first part of the game was fun, second part wasn't quite as good
01:34:20 <Micen> is that what its called?
01:34:52 <Camail> then the ending....it was the most unsatisfying conclusion you could possibly have
01:35:05 <Camail> MUST have been budget and deadline problems
01:35:19 <Camail> no self respecting dev would do what they did if they had a choice
01:36:29 <Micen> a part of me wants to ask what happens, because i never finished it, but a part of me wants to see it for myself. 
01:36:45 <Cane> Wait, it has a shit ending?
01:36:58 <Camail> imho the worst ever?
01:36:59 <Cane> I might not bother playing it then, 'cause I like my stories to conclude satisfactorily.
01:37:50 <Camail> QTEs are involved, I won't spoil to what degree
01:40:02 <Cane> lol fuck that.
01:44:48 <Camail> there's three parts to the final epic confrontations and the game gets progressively simpler each segment
01:45:19 <Camail> which is saying something, considering how simplet he arkham combat becomes if you 1. have ever played a game before and 2. have done any number of sidequests to get to higher levels
01:45:34 <Camail> which you do, because the game is fun
01:46:26 <Camail> the story is basically non-existent from the start so you can easily play up to the point you get bored then uninstall

01:53:46 <Cane> Appreciate the heads up Camail. I'll proooobably skip it though because if I get invested enough to want to see it through, I really don't want a big letdown.
02:02:55 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry
02:05:06 <Camail> also I'm strongly considering running the the 5e module Mines of Phandelver for 4-5 players so yea just tell me if anyone of you is interested

02:29:49 <Camail> ffs
02:30:09 <skram> you gonna do a online campaign cam
02:30:22 <Camail> ya
02:32:51 <ZK> mines of phandelver is fun
02:32:57 <ZK> I GMed that one with buddies
02:33:56 <skram> well id like to give it a try since tlpdnd thing didnt really pan out
02:34:11 <ZK> it worked for about 6 session as i recall
02:34:22 <ZK> I'm thinking of maybe doing a one shot wiht Dungeon World
02:34:30 <ZK> like a 4-6 hour one time session for fun
02:39:33 <Camail> one shots are interesting but i would be scared of them because there's no way of recovering from a bad session
02:40:37 <Camail> like our last game had a session where i was the only one playing for 45 minutes, but then the next session was made all the better because I was in jail so yea
02:40:58 <Camail> with a one shot that turns into just one session where its kinda boring for most people
02:42:54 <ZK> Hmm, I guess. I wouldnt mind playing or running a campaign as well, but I've also already went through mines of phandelver.
02:44:41 <Camail> I' not staying you shouldn't ever do one offs, I just wont be the one playing/DMing it
02:46:11 <ZK> I actually do prefer the campaign format, just cause getting to like your characters is so much more fun, but for trying out if roleplaying is for you, or for trying game systems, one-shots do that well
02:46:52 <ZK> you already know those, so wouldnt be for you. I'd love to do a campaign though, just worried on getting started/ creating the World
02:47:47 <Camail> part of my motivation to DM a simple module like this is to get some dm experience witohut having all the back end work
02:48:03 <Camail> focus more on dealing with deviations and improv than direct creation
02:48:30 <Camail> there might be another module i can find if you are interested in tlpdnd
02:48:54 <ZK> I'd love that plz <3
02:49:16 <ZK> there are quite a few beginner modules with 5e actually
02:49:51 <ZK> my main concerin is that it's not 4e, and im happy
02:50:00 <Camail> have you played hoard of the dragon queen
02:50:14 <ZK> nope
02:50:21 <Camail> I'll look into it
02:50:52 <Camail> also roll20 is complicated
02:50:56 <Camail> lots of bells and whistles
02:51:06 <Camail> gotta figure that out too

04:22:33 <Camail> ZK  have you done princes of the apocalypse
04:22:46 <ZK> nope
04:22:52 <ZK> only 5e ive done is mine of phandelver and custom stuff
04:23:28 <Camail> lol
04:23:43 <ZK> hey custom stuff is a lot of fun!
04:26:26 <Camail> no I mean that the only module you did happened to be the one i was looking at
04:26:38 <Camail> I'm only doing a module as my first game
04:26:53 <Camail> the real fun of DMing is in the creation and storytelling
04:35:19 <ZK> true
04:35:46 <ZK> but mines of phandelver is the most known 5e campaign :P
04:47:37 <Camail> princes can do 3-7 so thats probably better
04:48:18 <ZK> 7 ppl playing at once?
04:58:07 <Camail> well it all depends on interest
04:58:34 <Camail> I dont even think we have 7 people who would be both active enough and dedicated enough for a game in tlp
04:59:39 <ZK> true
05:00:46 <Camail> you, skram, maybe dot, maybe dub, maybe bio, maybe reif
05:01:05 <ZK> dot is pretty much confirmed i think
05:01:19 <Camail> yea but he's dot and we all secretly hate him
05:01:53 <ZK> looking at classes, what do i want to make...
05:01:56 <Camail> i dunno if bio would want to, dont think he ever expressed interest
05:02:08 <ZK> ill move away from autistic rangers i think
05:02:09 <Camail> just included him cuz he's one of the most regular here
05:02:25 <Camail> oh zk stepping out of his wheelhouse
05:02:26 <Camail> bold
05:02:46 <ZK> being autistic just feels so natural, you know!
06:21:22 <Camail> I'm not sure how i want to do stat rolls
06:21:31 <Camail> I used to like point systems a lot

06:42:15 <Camail> fuck, adren isnt joining c9
06:43:29 <motbob> TL really like awkward 6th player situations
06:43:37 <motbob> keith/piglet, and now this
07:01:40 <Camail> adren is under contract but its very very unlikely he will stay there, even after the miracle run
07:01:47 <Camail> even after getting fucked at DH
07:01:56 <Camail> I dunno...
07:02:18 <Camail> the best that can happen for adren is for simple to move back home for a ukranian or russian team
07:02:30 <Camail> koosta changed to main awper, and adren to take his position back
07:02:40 <Camail> because koosta can ONLY awp
07:02:53 <Camail> watching him as a rifler is just painful
07:03:39 <Camail> and simple is strongest when he can goes insane with the awp, take crazy peeks with the thinnest of margins that can really only be taken with awps

14:49:01 <DoT`> well i dint have to backtrack once
14:49:13 <DoT`> but there was far more uphill than i expected
14:49:34 <reification> i am slow at uphill
14:50:13 <DoT`> its the fact its a slope in the wrong direction thats the problem
14:50:38 <Micen> reverse the route?
14:51:02 <DoT`> im actually going to, as that way instead of a long uphill i will just have 1 sharp short uphill
14:51:38 <DoT`> its also a viable jogging route maybe, not too muddy
14:51:47 <DoT`> at least compared to the other routes i tried
14:52:59 <DoT`> skram
14:53:03 <DoT`> tis cute
14:54:23 <DoT`> http://ncmares.deviantart.com/art/And-Then-There-Were-Five-603883167
14:54:48 <skram> that too
14:55:56 <ZK> ok, i think im going with warlock
14:55:58 <ZK> seems fun
14:56:11 <DoT`> they do look fun

15:02:03 <DuB`> I can't decide if nap or additional study will be more helpful for test. 
15:05:26 <ZK> nap
15:13:02 <ZK> goign with half-elf warlock i think
15:13:05 <ZK> dunno if female or male
15:14:19 <skram> .roll d20 to gently pat DuB`s head
15:14:29 <skram> gentle as fuck, yo
15:20:23 <Rawr|Fone> !
15:23:17 <DoT`> skram is kind
15:23:35 <DoT`> dub, nap if its so0on, that extra hours study wont do as much as feeling awake
15:24:28 <DuB`> Going in 2 hours~!
15:24:43 <DuB`> And it's supposed to take 4 hours to take. T_T
15:24:47 <DoT`> time for hour nap, then get ready
15:24:55 <DoT`> 4 hour exams are harsh
15:25:00 <DoT`> definatt nap
15:25:28 <DoT`> my technical drawing was 4 hours
15:26:17 <DuB`> :(
15:26:18 <DuB`> Oh man.
15:26:19 <DuB`> I am
15:26:30 <DuB`> Going to celebrate so hard after tomorrow's is over too.
15:26:33 <DoT`> what is the exam?
15:26:38 <DuB`> Gonna find the nicest asian restaurant in town.
15:26:45 <DuB`> Today is accounting, the big one.
15:26:52 <DoT`> ewww
15:26:55 <DuB`> Probably the 2nd most important test in my life is all. :P
15:27:21 <DuB`> Will determine if I have to rethink my entire course plan or not!
15:27:46 <reification> i’m impressed you can manage to nap before it
15:27:52 <DuB`> No ewww, I've actually found it way fun.
15:27:56 <DuB`> Very logic-puzzle-like.
15:28:14 <reification> :D
15:28:15 <DoT`> i never liked accounting >.>
15:28:39 <DoT`> too many words in my nice maths 
15:28:57 <DuB`> I didn't like it until I did the actual stuff and hard stuff this semester.
15:31:38 <DoT`> well i guess i never though i would enjoy electronics till i did theengineer stuff

16:13:18 <skram> isnt it early for you cam
16:13:31 <Camail> yea, but doctors appointment
16:13:42 <skram> everything ok?
16:13:50 <Camail> we concluded that i need to nuke my sinuses
16:13:56 <skram> did they give you a prescription for massive buttface
16:13:57 <DuB`> :O
16:14:16 <Camail> my face is actually full of butt
16:14:36 <Camail> 2 weeks of steroids last time wasnt enough so now we're just killing anything that isn't part of me
16:14:55 <Camail> which will probably work!
16:15:01 <skram> woo
16:15:11 <Camail> oh dub, were you intesrested in tlpdnd
16:15:30 <DuB`> Nah.
16:15:34 <Camail> k
16:15:54 <Camail> skram  did you ever confirm that dot wanted to play or are we just assuming still
16:16:04 <Camail> because dot is a whore for any tlp group game
16:16:29 <DoT`> cam doesnt talk to me, he hates me
16:16:34 <skram> I never asked, but im sure I could seduce him
16:17:05 <Camail> you werent here when i pitched the idea! pls
16:17:49 <DoT`> <Camail> yea but he's dot and we all secretly hate him
16:17:53 <Camail> i randomly decided last night, i still have to read through a sizeable chunk of the module, scour the rulebook, etc.
16:18:10 <Camail> by definition you don't know about whatever secret hate i have for you
16:18:17 <Camail> and hate you find out about isn't there anymore
16:18:23 <Camail> any*
16:18:25 <skram> I need to make a character and probably read the handbook since I dont know what im doing.
16:18:37 <Camail> most wont
16:18:45 <Camail> I kinda do as a player but not as a dm
16:19:13 <DoT`> im probably playing a halfling monk because reasons
16:19:32 <DoT`> zk gave me a copy of 5rd handbook earlier
16:19:41 <DoT`> 5th ed*
16:26:34 <Micen>  and I was leaning towards a Tiefling bard if thats cool
16:28:14 <Camail> whatever is possible in the forgotten realms lore is fine
16:28:33 <ZK> half elf warlockkkkkkkkk
16:28:40 <Camail> also its fine to talk to other party members during character creation to create synergies in classes
16:29:17 <ZK> question: Do our characters meet up at start of adventure, or have we an established history?
16:29:25 <DoT`> it wouldnt have occured to me that that might be a problem
16:29:28 <DoT`> cam
16:29:32 <ZK> so far its fine DoT`
16:29:36 <Camail> there is an adventure hook that can be used or workshopped to fit the characters
16:29:41 <ZK> monk bard and warlock goes well together

16:29:58 <Camail> DoT`  its never a problem, only ever an advantage
16:30:14 <DoT`> i mean zk "<Camail> also its fine to talk to other party members during character creation to create synergies in classes"  i did not occur to me that that wouldnt be allowed
16:30:18 <Camail> yea
16:30:31 <Camail> well it depends on if you see that as meta gaming
16:30:43 <ZK> i think its fine
16:30:51 <Camail> some DMs or players might want to create their character in a vaccuum for RP purposes
16:30:53 <ZK> adventurers would look for adventureres that complement them
16:30:54 <DoT`> we are being casual are we not?
16:31:26 <Camail> well its a moot point because we all think its fine and I believe that there are in universe reasons for having a party that works well together
16:31:50 <carcinisation> haha i won both 1 in 9 chances for the gold rush flipout :D
16:32:02 <DoT`> nice reif!
16:32:12 <DoT`> so we have a 4th?
16:32:15 <DoT`> bio?
16:32:19 <Camail> dot zk micen and skram confirmed
16:32:28 <ZK> in the story hook, is it like we in a wagon, so we could establish we've worked some together before? Cause having backstory can be fun, even if we haven't necessarily decided what it is :P
16:32:37 <Camail> lemme look it up
16:32:56 <DoT`> i forgot to count myself when i checked or numbers, lol
16:32:56 <Camail> There is a party hook as well as optional backstory hooks i believe
16:33:03 <Camail> gj dot
16:33:10 <DoT`> im an engineer!
16:33:11 <Camail> you will be good at numbers when we play
16:33:40 <ZK> arent monks often studious?
16:34:28 <Camail> disciplined, i would say
16:34:51 <Camail> what that means is up to the player, i would say
16:35:14 <Camail> though i would imagine self control is important, but i havent read up on monks or how they work
16:35:22 <Camail> anyway, brb
16:36:10 <ZK> so skram watcha gonna be?
16:36:11 <ZK> ?dnd
16:36:45 <skram> I dont know yet ZK
16:36:47 <Runbunny> I believe that Skram is going to be a Hedge knight.
16:36:54 <skram> Im thinking barb or something
16:36:56 <Runbunny> You're welcome Jonas.
16:37:09 <skram> shaddup anders :|
16:37:42 <Micen> well skram, if your going to be a bard, let me know because i might switch
16:37:42 <DoT`> please skram, best hedge knight
16:37:51 <DoT`> he said barb
16:38:22 <ZK> yea micen, read okz
16:38:26 <Micen> oh barb.
16:38:42 <ZK> a barb, a monk, a warlock and a bard go into a bar
16:39:07 <Golly> http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Battlerager
16:40:40 <DoT`> now im going to be sad if skram isnt a hedge knight, why you do this angel
16:41:21 <Runbunny> Here is what you do Dot.
16:42:10 <Runbunny> You roll a character, get lots of charisma then you get bluff and you bluff him into being a hedge knight.
16:42:14 <Runbunny> You're welcome.
16:42:42 <ZK> oh pft, ill have to be the char that detects magic apparently
16:43:06 <ZK> hmmm, still gotta decide what affiliation to go with. 
16:43:31 <skram> i dont know exactly what but a person that hits shit with a sword zeke
16:43:36 <skram> and also not a bard
16:43:41 <skram> or anything related to greenery
16:43:53 <skram> ie not a druid or a fuckin hedge whatever
16:44:14 <DoT`> hedge knight is a knight that wonders
16:44:22 <DoT`> nothign to do with trees
16:44:25 <ZK> wanders*
16:44:25 <Micen> wanders*
16:44:29 <DoT`> >.>
16:44:34 <Micen> wow
16:44:44 <Micen> we both call you on it
16:45:22 <Runbunny> I'll do it as well.
16:45:37 <Runbunny> Jonas you should tell Dot about the word he misspelled.
16:46:30 <DoT`> look, the knigh can wonder while he wanders
16:46:48 <DoT`> knight
16:46:49 <Micen> hmm, maybe gnome bard sounds fun. 
16:47:00 <Micen> i dont usually play small races in rp games
16:47:07 <DuB`> I've always wondered: what on earth is the difference between a warlock, sorcerer, mage, and wizard?
16:47:18 <DoT`> you need to read dubs
16:47:23 <DuB`> Also this is not accouting curse you.
16:47:26 <DuB`> Nor is it nap.
16:47:33 <Micen> same difference between a computer, social and train engineer.
16:48:39 <Runbunny> Sorcerer is charisma based spell casting, wizard is int based.
16:48:45 <Runbunny> and other stuff
16:50:02 <DuB`zZz> k
16:50:03 <DoT`> later dubs
16:50:03 <ZK> wizard magic comes from spell books, sorcerer comes from blood lines, warlock comes from making a pact with godly folks
16:50:37 <DuB`zZz> What if you have books and blood and gods?
16:51:40 <carcinisation> skram KK let me down again :(
16:51:41 <Micen> then you just put mary sue as your class.
16:52:18 <carcinisation> but at least i flopped quad 5s on the other table and stacked a dude

17:12:36 <Camail> ok so the General adventure hook is that you're in a town called Red Larch, there is no other given hook
17:12:57 <skram> when do we start
17:13:02 <Camail> feel free to make pretty much any backstory you want as long as it isn't awful, i trust that none of you are dumb
17:13:07 <Camail> i dont know
17:13:23 <Camail> we need to figure out a time where everyone can play
17:13:37 <Camail> we're half us half eu
17:13:55 <Runbunny> remember to search for traps right at the get go and then search for invisible traps.
17:14:29 <Camail> but i don't know if i can feasibly be prepared for anything this week, nor would i expect you guys to be
17:14:43 <skram> do we roll for stats or do we have a given amount of stat points
17:14:57 <carcinisation2> and KK holds up this time :D
17:15:03 <skram> curse is broken
17:15:14 <Camail> I don't think I want to do stat points
17:15:37 <ZK> huh?
17:15:41 <Camail> I was thinking that you could roll up 2 or 3 sets of stats then pickt he one you want
17:15:57 <Micen> I am open at any time Cam. I will adjust to whatever
17:16:49 <DoT`> i know 3 methods, a certain number of stat points, random rolls for each, and 6 random rolls then assign where you want them
17:17:13 -!- Emily [~HoMM@HoMM.users.quakenet.org] has joined #tlponies
17:17:15 <Camail> Random rolls for each, but do that twice and pick the one you want
17:17:18 <Camail> if that feels good for everyone
17:17:26 <DoT`> Yo homm
17:17:32 <Camail> I dont want pure rng, so 2 or 3 tries
17:17:43 <ZK> so we roll 3d6 for each stat, and take whatever best outcome we get?
17:18:11 <Camail> as in, roll your 3d6 for all the stats, then make a seperate 3d6 roll for an entirely different set of stats
17:18:25 <Camail> at that point you will have two "characters" and you pick which set of stats you want
17:18:30 <DoT`> watch me get super low dex/wis on both :P
17:18:35 <Emily> hihi dot
17:18:53 <ZK> oh man, this can be really really bad
17:19:10 <Camail> if you really really don't like either then you can populate a 3rd set of stats but I don't encourage it
17:19:17 <Camail> ZK  it can be way way worse
17:19:34 <Camail> Its a very popular way to dm
17:19:43 <ZK> .roll 6 3d6
17:20:02 <skram> .roll 3d6
17:20:10 <Camail> you can do that in PMs

17:37:38 <ZK> ok i didnt roll too bad. 7 13 7 9 13 12
17:38:00 <ZK> im wise for some reason, and my strength and const are really low
17:38:03 <ZK> k, im a girl
17:38:33 <skram> when you roll for stats do you get 6 values you can put in whatever stat you want or do you roll 3d6 for each stat independently and pick whatevers best?
17:38:36 <carcinisation2> .roll d20 to boop zk
17:39:17 <ZK> you roll 3d6 for each stat independently. Then you have the numbers for each stat, and you have your character. If you dont like it, you re roll it a second time, and choose between the two
17:40:00 <ZK> its gonna change my character concept a bit, since i wanted her to be up close with an invoked dagger, but she'll be more runaway wiht these
17:45:01 <ZK> say for my first roll, i had better strength and dex, but my charisma was at 6, which is pretty unplayable for a charisma based character. So I re rolled all my stats and am pretty happy
17:46:00 <skram> these rolls are pretty bad
17:46:12 <ZK> yea. Average is supposed to be 11. I laugh at that.
17:46:36 <skram> 8 str 14 int 6 cha
17:46:49 <skram> im a socially awkward and noodly armed barbarian
17:46:57 <ZK> yeaaaaaaaaaa, re roll those
17:48:16 <ZK> the advantage of these random rolls is that they help your character organically. Oh super charsima, how would he react with that?
17:49:00 <skram> i suppose
17:50:23 <ZK> it is easier to build from point buy as you can just follow your character concept through
17:50:56 <carcinisation> ugh AQ vs QJ on a AQx flop and i still find a way to lose... D:
17:51:30 <DoT`> lol
17:51:38 <DoT`> 11, 11, 10, 10, 8, 16

17:52:15 <CockRoach|42> no RD?

17:52:40 <ZK> id love those stats DoT` :P
17:52:44 <CockRoach|42> oh
17:52:50 <ZK> roll again and see what you get

17:53:44 <CockRoach|42> :)
17:53:47 <skram> are you gonna do the lord bearington thing dot
17:54:01 <ZK> 16 isnt neough to do that
17:55:10 <Yolteotl> pones
17:55:11 <ZK> ooooooohhhhhhhhh Camail, can we do 4d6 drop lowest? or 2d6+6?
17:55:13 <Yolteotl> gsl tomorrow!
18:00:05 <ZK> 4d6 drop one gives me rolls that resemble point buy a lot more
18:04:10 <Micen_> you using roll20 for rolls?
18:05:16 <ZK> im using dice
18:05:30 <ZK> still waiting on camail if he lets me use my 4d6 remove lowest method :P
18:05:31 <Micen_> yeah should go get mine.
18:05:45 <ZK> but yea for game, probly use roll20

18:24:28 <Rawr|Fone> I'm left handed originally
18:24:51 <carcinisation> he's playing ping pong not fencing!
18:25:03 <Micen_> https://youtu.be/k7zvffHu_wo?t=1m25s
18:25:15 <Micen_> dang i didnt even get the link and you knew
18:26:20 <carcinisation> i was quoting it about 20 mins ago so it was fresh in my mind
18:26:50 <Micen_> I just rewatched 
18:26:57 <Micen_> my nephew got bored during that scene
18:27:06 <Micen_> because he wanted to play minecraft instead.
18:27:59 <carcinisation> make him watch the fight scene from they live :p
18:29:23 <Micen_> I'm giving you a choice: either put on these glasses or start eatin' that trashcan.
18:32:40 <Camail> ZK  i kinda like the idea of 4d6 and drop 1, we can try that and see how it spreads out
18:32:43 <Camail> stats are tricky to deal with
18:33:13 <Camail> I really really want the stats to be more than just "and i give myself the highest bonus for my relevant class and dump the most useless one"
18:33:21 <Camail> which is why i dont want to do points
18:33:37 <Camail> cuz thats how the last campaign panned out
18:38:15 <Camail> https://app.roll20.net/join/1375189/xcx54Q
18:38:34 <Camail> thats the game link
18:38:40 <Yolteotl> PONES§

18:38:48 <Yolteotl> trailer \o./
18:41:46 <Camail> i selected a charactersheet for the game
18:41:54 <Camail> dunno how that works or how you access it
18:44:48 <Camail> afk again
18:49:05 <carcinisation> hi yolo <3
18:49:10 <Yolteotl> hi reif!
18:49:28 <carcinisation> when is the french dreamhack thing and is it near you?
18:49:35 <Yolteotl> hmm
18:49:38 <Yolteotl> mid may
18:49:43 <Yolteotl> I may not go D:
18:49:54 <carcinisation> :(
18:50:11 <skram> i wonder how many differences there are gonna be between the movie and the literal mountains of lore its based on
18:51:58 <Yolteotl> some
18:53:21 <Yolteotl> but not that much if you take in account that Blizzard changed the lore already like 10 times :p
18:53:58 <skram> fair enough lol
18:54:36 <Yolteotl> for example, they added a queen for the king of azeroth
18:54:55 <Yolteotl> or flying dalaran
18:58:34 <skram> thats true
19:08:28 <ZK> .r charsheet https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=D3822B50929BAFA!17607&authkey=!AAk1N3ecLhYNriM&ithint=file%2cpdf
19:16:02 <Camail> butts
19:16:57 <ZK> couldnt find the character sheet on roll20
19:17:06 <Camail> hmmm
19:17:21 <Camail> i wonder why it lets me select one
19:18:00 <Camail> why does skram have cards
19:18:04 <Camail> what is happening
19:19:42 <DoT`> ok, i am back
19:19:51 <ZK> are you?
19:19:52 <DoT`> we still doing the double roll methos
19:20:11 <DoT`> methos
19:20:17 <DoT`> method
19:20:22 <Camail> just do 4d6 and drop 1
19:20:22 <DoT`> my hands are frozen
19:20:37 <Camail> still going down the list tho, no rearranging or anything fancy
19:20:59 <DoT`> ok, my first attempt with 3d6 got 11, 11, 10, 10 , 8, 16
19:21:08 <DoT`> 4d6 time
19:21:30 <DoT`> nooooo
19:21:44 <DoT`> 11 dex
19:21:49 <DoT`> dream is dead
19:21:53 <ZK> i was going through forums, someone said that as a GM, he likes to give the pool one 18 and one 16 that the group decides who it goes to, which lets them have a more balanced party
19:22:21 <Camail> meh
19:22:24 <Camail> I like this better
19:23:03 <ZK> the problem is, character archetypes need at least their main stat to not be horrible. Rest is determined by luck, but at least their characters remain viable
19:23:21 <DoT`> 14, 11, 16, 17, 7, 9
19:23:30 <DoT`> that sucks
19:23:32 <ZK> because at some point, they'd be better off just changingto another class. 
19:23:35 <ZK> And lol so smart
19:23:40 <ZK> monk studied a lot
19:23:48 <DoT`> and has no wis or dex
19:24:10 <Camail> I'm absolutely not doing the 18/16 thing
19:24:23 <Camail> thats the only certainty
19:24:44 <ZK> can we find a way to have the characters be viable thouh?
19:24:56 <Camail> I'm thinking
19:25:02 <ZK> Like switch one with another, but only once? I dunno, but 11 for main stat is horrid
19:25:17 <DoT`> wis and dex are both main wit monk
19:25:23 <Camail> it is, I've been trying to think of a way to get around it
19:25:48 <Camail> I was thinking about the swap idea a bit, haven't had much time to think about any of it in the last 3-4 hours tho
19:27:04 <Camail> because ultimately i agree with you zk
19:28:46 <Camail> I'm fine with 1 swap
19:29:29 <GGMethos> owo
19:29:30 <Camail> 2 wouldn't work, then we would just get an equivalent system to that 18/16 idea
19:29:33 <GGMethos> pinged 3 times 
19:29:53 <DoT`> are we still doing 2 rolls with 4d6?
19:30:05 <Camail> if we do swaps then we arent doing 2 rolls
19:30:07 <DoT`> heyo methos
19:30:22 <GGMethos> hi DoT
19:30:35 <GGMethos> biking now :)
19:31:04 <DoT`> nice! i want t get a bike again soon
19:31:11 <Camail> so choose between doing an entire reroll or swapping a roll
19:31:21 <Camail> also dot you can do the rols on r20
19:31:26 <Camail> zk and skram have
19:31:41 <DoT`> link?
19:31:46 <Camail> https://app.roll20.net/join/1375189/xcx54Q
19:32:08 <Camail> skram why do you have a card
19:32:12 <Camail> I'm gonna steal it
19:33:09 <Camail> zk skram DoT`  https://wiki.roll20.net/Character_Sheets
19:34:38 <Camail> and a doc on the sheet itself https://wiki.roll20.net/5th_Edition_OGL_by_Roll20
19:38:46 <skram> i got kinda decent rolls
19:39:53 <skram> wtf is the point of these fuckin cards tho
19:40:10 <Camail> i dont know why are they there
19:40:12 <Camail> why do you have one
19:40:18 <Camail> i tried stealing it
19:40:27 <Camail> STOP TAKING CARDS
19:40:49 <DoT`> im trying to figure out how to get a character sheet still
19:41:03 <Camail> make a character and go to journal
19:41:16 <Camail> i think it says how in the first link i posted?
19:41:18 <DoT`> how to make character though
19:41:29 <Camail> add a cahracte rint he journal page
19:41:55 <ZK> what, i have to redo my rolls on roll 20 :o but i liked what i gots with my own dice t.t
19:42:01 <ZK> fine, doing the real one on roll20
19:42:08 <Camail> you dont need to
19:42:12 <Camail> if you rolled with oyur own dice
19:42:16 <ZK> oh ok cool
19:42:30 -!- Frigo1 [~Frigo@catv-80-99-5-67.catv.broadband.hu] has joined #tlponies
19:43:00 <ZK> im just really happy to have nothing under 9, which i find amazing
19:43:03 <DoT`> i got nothing in journal cam, its blank
19:43:38 <Camail> there isnt a +add button?
19:43:43 <Camail> hmmm
19:43:46 <DoT`> nope, its blank
19:43:46 <ZK> nyope
19:43:50 <ZK> ?charsheet
19:43:56 <ZK> doesnt this work?
19:43:59 <DoT`> gm has to activate the +sheet thing
19:44:26 <DoT`> but the rolld20 is attached to the site, makes things easier
19:44:40 <DoT`> if it works
19:45:20 <DoT`> "o change or add Character Sheet, the GM should visit the Game Settings from the Settings dropdown on the Game Details page. "
19:45:32 <Camail> ZK  that sheet works but if we can get an integrated sheet it will be very useful
19:45:38 <ZK> agreed, go for it!
19:45:38 <Camail> there's some autofill and stuff
19:46:49 <Camail> ZK  check the journal
19:46:55 <Camail> i made a character and gave you control
19:47:28 <ZK> still empty
19:47:32 <DoT`> i see mine
19:47:49 <Camail> ok yea
19:48:08 <Camail> ok dot edit something then save and tell me
19:48:12 <Camail> edit the name i guess

19:50:22 <Camail> k try again
19:50:36 <Camail> k i tihnk i figured it all out
19:50:58 <DoT`> time to roll then
19:51:00 <DoT`> oh dear
19:51:06 <Camail> Micen_  are you all caught up with whats happening
19:52:18 <Micen_> Sorry, had some personal stuff pop up, let me scroll up and read whats going on
19:52:50 <Camail> I ca summarize
19:52:53 <Camail> can*
19:52:58 <Camail> its easier that way
19:53:10 <Camail> this is the link to the game https://app.roll20.net/join/1375189/xcx54Q
19:53:19 <Camail> once you join I will assign you a character that you can edit
19:53:59 <Camail> we are rolling stats in the following way: 4d6 for each stat going top to bottom, after the last roll you have the option of swapping a single stat for another single stat
19:54:09 <Camail> there is an integrated character sheet
