00:03:00 <Camail> aha, fixed the abigail scene
00:03:12 <Camail> you have to erase the saved seenevent flag
00:03:18 <Camail> but then avoide maru
00:03:27 <Camail> because her events also trigger the same flag
00:03:29 <Camail> because bugs

02:34:20 <Camail> .tell dub` no skins, just stardew on steam
02:55:26 <DuT`> so cam, no wife still to do farm chores?
02:56:26 <Camail> i got the scene to happen
02:56:30 <Camail> but winter still is a thing
02:56:35 <Camail> then i need to wait for rain
02:56:48 <DuT`> why?
02:57:19 <Camail> have you gotten married yet
02:57:42 <DuT`> yea, in first game
02:57:44 <DuT`> worked fine
02:57:56 <Camail> you need to get the amulet
02:58:02 <Camail> which means you need rain
02:59:07 <DuT`> oh of course
02:59:39 <DuT`> i had rain the day after i got 10 hearts, so it was easy
03:00:39 <DuT`> lucky
03:04:14 <DuT`> i have handed flowers to leah
03:04:29 <DuT`> but she is expensive, doesnt like any basic stuff like other peasants :/
03:04:36 <DuT`> love*
03:08:01 <Camail> what
03:08:04 <Camail> she likes salad
03:08:11 <Camail> and every crop
03:08:16 <Camail> she is THE cheapest
03:11:50 <DuT`> salad needs kale that i didnt grow much of >.>
03:12:17 <DuT`> and while she likes crops, she doesnt love them
03:12:32 <DuT`> so i am using wine, but thats very time intensive
03:14:16 <DuT`> abi is amythists that i always have a lot of, penny is root platters
03:14:30 <DuT`> haley hates me! but i found she likes sunflowers
03:14:39 <DuT`> but she is increasing slowly
03:15:17 <DuT`> leah just ended up being the one i had no easy access to things she loves
03:15:53 <Camail> dot buy salad from the bar
03:15:55 <Camail> its 200g
03:17:09 <DuT`> ooooo, well then
03:17:29 <DuT`> i havnt tried to buy things form gus since the first day when i cheked his stuff
03:35:35 <Camail> i picked agriculture dot
03:35:42 <Camail> lookinga t threads, apparently its better than 10%
03:37:41 <DuT`> yea i saw, it can be up to 50% quicker
03:38:20 <DuT`> but eh, it doesnt work with berries, and animal products are artisan, so i dont think it really works out to any great diffrence
03:38:32 <DuT`> im being south african, artisan farms is what we do
03:38:41 <DuT`> us rich white south african farmers
03:46:35 <DuT`> hows the farm bio
03:48:32 <Camail> people who want to marry emily are anti-saving clint

05:26:57 <Camail> ew
05:27:01 <Camail> fucking ew
05:28:44 <Camail> hey motbob, turns out that there's a way to reduce plant growth cycles by a quite a few days so there's so many more numbers for you to explore
05:28:48 <Camail> parsnips in 2 days!
05:29:00 <Camail> say hello to the rest of your life
05:29:35 <Camail> year 3 you run out of farm space, slowly buying out businesses and using them as parsnip farms
05:29:40 <Camail> first its marnie and leah
05:29:47 <Camail> there's a stalemate at the wizards tower
05:29:57 <Camail> pierre's caves to a buy out easily
05:30:21 <motbob> the best crops return-wise that don't take a lot of watering seem to be multi-return crops
05:30:36 <motbob> which aren't affecte b y speed-gro afte rhte initial grow
05:30:42 <Camail> which sadly doesnt really exist in spring
05:30:45 <Camail> which is annoying!
05:31:05 <Camail> but iridium sprinklers
05:31:10 -!- Golly [~Golly@1.92-221-121.customer.lyse.net] has joined #tlponies
05:31:46 <Camail> i can have 8 of those which really only means planting and picking up 192 things
05:32:10 <Camail> which is pretty fast because there's no animation for picking up crops
05:32:52 <Camail> also the faster growth means you probably get one more harvest out of each plant which is pretty solid
05:33:00 <Camail> and not just speed gro, there's a perk for it
05:33:08 <motbob> once you have a lot of iridium sprinklers, you probably have  lot of cash and can therefore just max profit/square
05:34:18 <Camail> still if you get 5 harvests out of a crop and can get an extra one, that's a huge increase
05:35:20 <Camail> nt to mention that in spring, so one third of the growing seasons dont have a reliable persistent crop
05:35:34 <Camail> I cant xonfidently say its better, but its not obviously worse
05:35:38 <motbob> if Agriculturalist (the perk) decreases time between multi-harvest harvests, that's a Big Deal
05:35:38 <Camail> confidently*
05:35:50 <Camail> i dont know that
05:36:15 <Camail> but what i do know is that it lets them mature a few days faster and some crops will get another harvest in by the 28th
05:36:30 <Camail> especially the crops with really long maturation times
05:36:36 <Camail> like cranberries, i think
05:36:52 <Camail> long time to mature, but 4 day cycle
05:37:06 <Camail> i still dont know how important animals are
05:37:10 <Camail> kinda just doing them for the bundles atm
05:37:33 <Camail> they are incredibly expensive
05:39:10 <Camail> it looks like the re-harvesting time doesnt change
05:39:29 <motbob> yeah i'm also just interested in the bundles
05:39:49 <motbob> i plan to make friends with my animals and then sell them
05:40:05 <Camail> like life
05:40:39 <Camail> ok cranberries go to 4 days, so you save 3 days which means the 21 days of harvesting is 24 so they dont get an extra cycle
05:40:44 <Camail> which suuuucks
05:41:48 <Camail> i kinda think this perk should be a bit better
05:43:13 <motbob> mmm
05:43:21 <Camail> lol, normal speed gro + the perk makes ti go slower
05:44:12 <motbob> well, the perk increases %return by a lot, but at a time when %return doesn't really matter
05:44:54 <Camail> well the other option is artisinal products
05:45:11 <Camail> that takes a long as time to scale up to really churn a profit
05:45:16 <Camail> but it might be the end game
05:47:34 <Camail> oh on the topic of perks, i think that going down the crabpots branch is unequivocally the best option
05:47:36 <motbob> let's see how much this rhubarb crop nets me
05:47:48 <Camail> pick the no bait perk, and you have a steady stream of quality fertilizer
05:49:01 <motbob> "crab pots never catch trash" is far better for efficiency
05:49:06 <motbob> far, far better
05:49:15 <Camail> rhubarb goes down to 8 days, apparently
05:49:36 <motbob> i went for Fisher so I could get the treasure perk
05:49:59 <Camail> yea but whats easier to scale up, bait generation or crab pots
05:50:06 <Camail> you dont even have to stay on your farm for crab pots
05:51:04 <Camail> i wanted to go with fishing initially
05:51:10 <Camail> kinda messed up there
05:51:16 <Camail> but i don't like spending time fishing anymore
05:51:29 <Camail> maybe i just got burned out on it
05:51:43 <motbob> bro
05:52:03 <motbob> isn't one bug meat 5 bait
05:52:25 <motbob> you just swipe your sword at that harmless flying rat thing
05:53:00 <Camail> why would i even be on that level of the mine, tho
05:53:08 <Camail> i need to farm iridium
05:53:08 <motbob> camail, if you get burned out on fishing how will you ever catch the Legendary Fish
05:53:22 <Camail> I caught 2
05:54:13 <Camail> its really just about getting a lucky pattern
05:54:54 <Camail> and i know where they all are because i found a book in the ground that told me
05:54:57 <Camail> must be a reliable source
05:55:33 <Camail> wow, thanks for the 500g lewis
05:55:35 <Camail> really nice
05:57:52 <Camail> I'm gonna line the entire southern river with crab pots
05:57:54 <Camail> its gonna be great

14:55:31 <Micen|Droid> Bio, you around? 
14:55:39 <DuT`> why do trees clean the air? what they get from it
14:56:27 <carcinisation> part of photosynthesis iirc
14:56:34 <DuT`> i was taught they get minrals form the ground, energy from the sun
14:56:48 <DuT`> so its a byproduct 
14:56:57 <DuT`> hmmm, that sounds familier maybe
14:56:58 <carcinisation> co2 is one of the inputs i think
14:57:43 <DuT`> mana :(  he is making me sad
14:58:14 <carcinisation> here dut https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis#/media/File:Photosynthesis_equation.svg

15:49:34 <DoT`> tentacle things are silly but they didnt leave the room after i died the first time
15:50:43 <Runbunny> I think there's a total of like 8-9 snakes in that room.
15:50:45 <Runbunny> maybe less.
15:51:02 <Runbunny> there are more tentacle thingies.
15:54:44 <DoT`> i dont know, the sneks where easy in sens but i am failing badly here
15:56:42 <DoT`> maybe i need to get my sword more than +10 but im not sure how

22:16:49 <Camail> yea this legendary fish is the easiest to catch
22:16:57 <Camail> makes sense, felt that way especially with this tackle
22:17:17 <DoT`> it wasnt as hard as i expected

23:51:05 <Crisium> jodi shows up at door "bring large mass bass to dinner tonight"
23:51:18 <Crisium> mfw i catch it with about an hour to spare :O
23:51:24 <DoT`> ooo
23:54:31 <Camail> and its all done
23:54:36 <Camail> no more worrying about marriage
23:54:47 <Crisium> you killed them all?
23:54:48 <Camail> really annoyed i couldnt get it done the first year
23:54:56 <Camail> honestly if you're a try hard you could get it done first summer
23:55:35 <Camail> my house is already fully upgraded
23:55:51 <Camail> so its like...a weird timing
23:55:57 <DoT`> yea, i dont know if i do it though it might mess up the 10 heart scene and skip it
23:56:09 <DoT`> but cant get the scne in winter :/
23:56:13 <Camail> hmmm, i dunno
23:56:24 <Crisium> so you can take multiple single ppl to 10 hearts?
23:56:31 <Crisium> they dont care you are playing the field?
23:57:03 <Camail> i wonder if pierre is super hype
23:57:13 <DoT`> i have leah at 10, abi at 9, penny maru 8
23:57:14 <Camail> that the single biggest patron of his shop marries his daughter
23:57:32 <Crisium> but you need bouquet to get over 8 with the single ppl?
23:57:33 <Camail> he's probably trying to write a bunch of shit in fine print on the marriage license agreements
23:57:43 <Camail> Crisium  until you give it to at least one person yes
23:57:44 <DoT`> doesnt seem so Crisium 
23:57:56 <Crisium> hmm interesting
23:58:08 <Camail> i tried getting abby passed 8 without giving any flowers
23:58:15 <Camail> and it failed
23:58:21 <Camail> but as soon as you pick someone it unlocks
