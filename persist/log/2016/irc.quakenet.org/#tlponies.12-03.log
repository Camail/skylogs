02:34:36 <Dot`> skram: 
02:37:19 <skram> yes dear
02:37:54 <Dot`> <3
02:37:58 <Dot`> how are you doing
02:38:27 <skram> im playing overwatch and listening to electro swing
02:38:30 <skram> so pretty good actually
02:38:51 <Dot`> sounds nice
02:44:13 <ZK> .roll d20 to boop Dot`
02:44:27 <Bio> So fancy
02:46:17 <ZK> i went to uni for last engineering party of semeseter
02:46:19 <ZK>  we did a tornado
02:46:48 <ZK> which is having some awful fruity aloholic drinks, taking a sip, and passing it to the next person in the circle till all drinks are finished
02:46:55 <ZK> not most hygienic thing
02:47:30 <ZK> im probly not durnk, but meh
02:49:10 <Dot`> cr http://imgur.com/gallery/QmZR9
02:55:48 <Cane> Dot`, still mostly playing with occasional tinkering when I go "this would be fun."
02:56:05 <Dot`> when is caneMod ?
02:57:44 <Dot`> just dip a bit deeper and fix the factions would you? ty
02:57:57 <Dot`> this cane is a great guy
02:58:25 <Cane> That would require a level of commitment that's a bit beyond me right now I'm afraid.
02:58:33 <Bio> =P
02:58:34 <Cane> I also deleted Dynamic Factions.
02:58:45 <Cane> Interesting idea but bad execution.
02:59:07 <Cane> At the end of my session my faction was allied with everyone but monolith, or at least cease fire.
02:59:16 <Cane> But there's tons of quests the NPCs give you that require you to kill natural enemies of that faction.
02:59:32 <Cane> And if you take those quests and go to kill them, they're now technically friends so you lose reputation and faction relations.
02:59:58 <Cane> And there's something really dumb about loners being allied with both the military and bandits.
03:00:22 <Cane> Not to mention it makes the zone much easier since you don't have to worry about random bandits or military patrols any more-
03:00:43 <Cane> So yeah, doesn't add much. Would recommend the A-Life extended mod instead, which at least adds more patrols.
03:01:03 <Dot`> i didnt realise you could ally factions, sounds silly!
03:01:10 <Dot`> all death, peace through power
03:01:23 <Cane> Yep. If you kill enough bandits, the army goes "well they're all right then, cease fire, let's ally."
03:01:35 <Dot`> :/
03:01:38 <Dot`> pls fix
03:01:40 <Cane> And if you kill enough monolith the bandits also go "well they're all right then, we too hate the monolith people, friends 4 ever!"
03:01:57 <Cane> Also, Duty and Freedom should never ever have a cease fire. WTF mod.
03:02:06 <Dot`> exactly
03:02:20 <Cane> There's no catches for all the lore stuff. It's just numbers, whatever.
03:02:32 <Dot`> like maybe stalkers and clear skies are smir neutral and could get allied with duty or freedom, or eachother
03:02:41 <Cane> Yeah, that's the stuff I'd like.
03:02:44 <Dot`> but military and bandits ally with no one
03:03:23 <Cane> I modded it to where bandits and military and duty/freedom allegiances never change, but then I realized the only thing left is loner being friends or netural towards duty/freedom, so it's pointless.
03:03:42 <Cane> Unless I changed the mod a lot and really got into the mechanical details and added a whole bunch of variables...
03:03:44 <Dot`> gah, why do stalker moders do this
03:03:46 <Cane> Too much work for too little gain.
03:03:48 <Dot`> what happens to them
03:04:00 <Dot`> that they end up like this
03:04:30 <Dot`> im waiting on ArmStalker
03:04:39 <Cane> Yeah, that looks like it might be enjoyable.
03:04:49 <Dot`> we can hope!
03:05:01 <Dot`> its all russian atm though
03:05:51 <Cane> No worries! If it's even remotely good, all the STALKER fans currently suffering from a major case of blue balls will happily translate it for us.
03:07:27 <skram> i dont trust the translation skills of the stalker community
03:08:10 <Cane> Oh, what, Google Translate isn't enough for you?
