21:29:12 <Camail> pewpew time
21:35:08 <Dott> dont get pewed
21:41:30 <Dott> BIO
21:50:50 <Phearlaptop> yes! My ice tea has developed a perfect thin layer of ice on the inside that turns into a bit of slushy-ice mix when disturbed.
21:50:53 <Phearlaptop> Perfect!
21:51:02 <Bio> ahsdgib
21:51:05 <Bio> yes dot
21:51:12 <Camail> Dott  you have killed so many people
21:51:21 <Dott> in self defence!
21:51:23 <Dott> moslty
21:51:25 <Dott> sometimes
21:51:41 <Dott> dont you lay those idiots deaths at MY feat!
21:51:46 <Camail> you went into a tower and slaughtered them in their sleep
21:52:04 <Phearlaptop> Justice sneaks up to get you in your sleep
21:52:20 <Dott> even the pretty one
21:52:59 <Camail> all you know is that she was really nice
21:53:06 <Camail> you nerds assumed she was pretty
21:53:13 <Dott> oh yea, i blame skram
21:53:33 <Camail> literally imposing your standards of beauty
21:53:51 <Dott> she was buetifull on the inside
21:53:57 <Dott> your the one that assumed i meant physical 
21:54:02 <Dott> WoW cam
21:54:12 <Camail> pretty on the inside is a metaphor
21:54:28 <Dott> i cant help being poetic!
21:54:33 <Camail> if i cant assume you arent always tlaking in metaphor then we cant have a common line of communication
21:54:43 <Camail> which is more important
21:55:08 <Dott> my freedom of expression
21:55:27 <Camail> nope
21:55:34 <Camail> dungeon of expression
21:55:47 <Dott> does the dungeon have a cleric?
21:56:11 <Camail> why would it
21:56:30 <Dott> why woudlnt it? clerics do bad stuff too
21:56:52 <Camail> what use would a bad cleric be
21:57:29 <Phearlaptop> We wouldn't feel bad about threatening them
21:57:41 <Dott> evil clerics hurt ppl
21:57:46 <Dott> and say nasty things about them
21:57:48 <Dott> to thier face!
21:57:55 <Camail> i just had the briefest of thoughts for sub to play viera then i laughed and thought "No one touched my baby."
21:57:59 <Camail> dub*
21:58:14 <Phearlaptop> haha
21:58:19 <Phearlaptop> That's good
21:58:43 <Camail> she is mine forever
22:03:49 <Camail> and the fact that she can exist with like 95% of the same mechanics just continues to blow my mind
22:04:42 <Camail> the only things missing are the shitty dailies and shitty non-character-essential skills
