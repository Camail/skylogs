18:13:10 <skram> tell me the subject and ill do one half
18:13:25 <DoT`> please say its ponies
18:13:45 <skram> Yeah I only know like 4 things so hopefully its about one of them
18:14:40 <DuB> Reflections on what we've learned about New Testament historical and cultural context. :P
18:15:11 <DoT`> pfff
18:15:18 <DoT`> religion, and reflective
18:15:33 <skram> well i had religion class some 10 years ago
18:15:42 <DoT`> thats like the easiest thing ever to write dub
18:15:51 <DuB> Yah.
18:15:57 <DoT`> as both of those things are silly
18:16:03 <DuB> Hey now.
18:16:14 <DuB> I should be able to finish it before I get home for the day, though.
18:16:45 <DuB> I just don't have my notes right now so it'll mostly have to be generalizations. 
18:17:07 <DoT`> i went to a Christian Brothers Colledge school, i know my reflective/religeous essays dub
18:17:11 <DoT`> :P
18:17:24 <DuB> Haha~
18:17:39 <skram> I was in a church once. I fiddled with the organ. Dont think ive been since
18:18:02 <DuB> I had to take at least 14 credits to keep scholarship, but this semester was mostly just for finishing up 2 pre-req classes for me.
18:18:08 <DuB> So I had some space to fill.
18:18:12 <DoT`> we went to church for important fancy christian holidays, free school day really
18:18:15 <DuB> And this was easy/interesting.
18:18:26 <DoT`> and one guy always fell asleep, Noddy
18:18:30 <DuB> Hahahaaha
18:18:36 <Phearlaptop> At least here in norway. Moderate protestant christianity has been nice and progressive.
18:18:48 <skram> pews are so uncomfortable though
18:18:51 <Phearlaptop> Yeah
18:19:14 <DoT`> I dont know why he was called Noddy, thats just what everyone called him, even the teachers
18:19:31 <DoT`> it was years before i learnt his actual name
18:19:53 <DuB> Sounds like my kind of guy, dot.
18:20:06 <DoT`> indeed
18:20:11 <DuB> Most of my classes this week have been review/wrap-up .
18:20:14 <DuB> Many naps.
18:21:14 <skram> I almost miss last year of tech school. All we did was fuck with stuff all day.
18:22:38 <DuB> Educational.
18:24:07 <DuB> Why did we have to start a fun new game that I love right before finals week!
18:24:11 <DuB> Maaaaaaji
18:24:24 <skram> Hah. We only fucked with things relevant to the field though. I learnt machining when we machined a 8 pound dick for some girls in a different class we had a project with...
18:25:55 <skram> I have not made any penises since but machining is a good skill to have
18:26:16 <DoT`> haha
18:26:19 <DoT`> life skills

18:40:14 <DoT`> with like at least 12 ppl?
18:40:14 <skram> I dont know. I stay away from the population centers in case of zombie outbreak.
18:40:44 <Phearlaptop> I'm sure there are more than 12 people in Drammen
18:40:57 <DoT`> have you counted?
18:40:58 <Phearlaptop> But who knows really. Maybe they're all the same 12 and are just changlings.
18:41:30 <Phearlaptop> But yeah the place is large enough that the airport express train stops here Dot
18:41:42 <Phearlaptop> Prettyyyy central as far as norwegian places are concerned.
18:42:47 <DuB> Well aren't you important.

21:53:48 <Yolteotl> Bloodborne was Sony only
21:54:08 <Yolteotl> but Dark Soul is multi platform
21:54:35 <Camail> oh right
21:54:45 <Yolteotl> It will be birthday present for my roommate :D
21:54:47 <Camail> oddly enough, still indifferent
21:54:57 <Yolteotl> + pandemic legacy

22:07:15 <DoT`> steam is silly
22:08:16 <DoT`> you broke it
22:09:00 <DoT`> game sound is much higher than voice
22:11:41 <DoT`> stream is dropping for me
22:11:56 <Runbunny> yeah I see that in OBS.
22:12:03 <Runbunny> not really sure what to do about it though
22:12:25 <Runbunny> I think that installing dark souls 3 and streaming at the same time is too much for my CPU.
22:12:58 <DoT`> hmm, hopefully thats it
