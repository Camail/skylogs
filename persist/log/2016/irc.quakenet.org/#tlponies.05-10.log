16:53:43 <skram> DoT`, I had to chaffeur grandma
16:54:07 <skram> so I missed last 3 hours of overwatch but I didnt have the heart to tell her no because I have to play videogames
17:00:30 <Camail> .tell zk weird interaction, devil's sight only works in darkness, so in dim lighting you still have the normal penalties outside your natural 60ft darkvision range
17:05:54 <Camail> god there's 630 pages of dnd designer tweets answering corner case questions
17:06:05 <Camail> well at least i have something to read
17:06:08 <DoT`> lol
17:07:51 <Camail> its really nice because I prefer rules as intedned (RAI) over rules as written(RAW) because they're usually way better
17:07:58 <Camail> i hate people who just want to break the game
17:08:30 <Camail> and the designers want to create a harmony between balancing and creating a cohesive world
17:17:05 <DoT`> you run into that so much in Warhammer table top
17:17:37 <DoT`> even when the intention of the rule and purpose is obvious, ppl will try use it as written in some weird interpretation
17:17:47 <DoT`> to gain advantage
17:21:52 <Camail> luckily i can just say lolno
17:22:01 <Camail> also zk's combo isnt as amazing as it seems
17:22:14 <Camail> a 30 ft sphere of darkness canb e annoying for the enemy, but also for allies
17:22:47 <DoT`> i assume he mostly plans to stay back and use his 120 range
17:22:55 <Camail> not only does it actively conflict with the driftglobe, but using it in tight combat encounters will be difficult
17:23:04 <Camail> there's not always room
17:23:08 <Camail> in fact there rarely is
17:23:08 <DoT`> i thought about this, and we will see how it works out with him and dub
17:23:15 <Camail> unless you're beaing attacked in an open field
17:23:29 <Camail> like i said, great combo, great drawbacks
17:23:34 <Camail> will be interesting
17:23:49 <Camail> also i dunno if everyone heard, but anyone can use the wand of magic missile
17:24:04 <Camail> there are wands that spellcasters must attune to
17:24:11 <Camail> which only eliminates bardum, ironically
17:25:09 <Camail> once you took the avatar path you tecnically became a spellcaster
17:49:24 <skram> wasnt overwatch supposed to end an hour ago DoT`
17:49:30 <DoT`> yes
17:49:37 <DoT`> maybe only open beta?
17:49:46 <Camail> didnt they extend the time
17:49:48 <skram> im still playing
17:50:02 <skram> dont know cam, couldnt find any blue posts about it
17:50:33 <Camail> well if its supposed to end at 12, thats still an hour from now in PST

17:50:48 <skram> dont know what this means?

19:12:53 <Bio> 4 times!
19:12:56 <Bio> =O
19:13:08 <Bio> and solo ulted renbot the same number of times
19:13:10 <DoT|Phone> I saw pon
19:13:11 <Bio> rofl
19:13:31 <DoT|Phone> we are all proud
19:16:15 <Camail> dot i found a really weird interaction, someone could theoretically take the defensive duelist feat, carry a dagger, drop it when they want to attack, then pick it up as an item interaction at the end of their turn
19:16:42 <Camail> the downside is that you have to keep track of the dagger
19:17:17 <DoT`> are you sure item interaction is not a subclass of bonus action
19:17:27 <Camail> 100%
19:17:31 <Camail> its in the rules
19:18:12 <Camail> page 190 in the phb
19:19:00 <Camail> you can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free during your action or movement
19:20:35 <Camail> hmmm
19:20:46 <Camail> but it must be in tandem with either movement or your action
19:21:16 <Camail> so tecnically if you wanted to do the dagger trick you would have to safe 5ft of movement to split your movement up
19:21:46 <DoT`> it just seems odd, as you would need to go prone to pick it up
19:21:55 <DoT`> and standing up from prone uses movment
19:22:00 <Camail> no you wouldnt
19:22:03 <Camail> prone is ont he ground
19:22:05 <Camail> without proper footing
19:22:12 <Camail> you can crouch while standing
19:22:38 <DoT`> oh ya, of course, prone is not crouch
19:22:42 <DoT`> brain please
19:22:53 <Camail> pls brain
19:22:56 <Camail> brian pls
19:23:02 <Camail> brian, pls brian
19:23:36 <Camail> you can physically describe it fairly interestingly
19:23:49 <Camail> throwing the dagger up in the air, doing your attacks, then catching it
19:24:22 <Camail> throwing it into the ground, piercing the floor, then kicking it back up with your feet
19:24:26 <Camail> so many cool things
19:25:02 <DoT`> i tihnk you are runing into the Rai vs Raw here, its not really practical and will get tedious after a few combats
19:25:26 <Camail> thats not rai vs raw
19:25:45 <Camail> rai vs raw is a rule design tension
19:25:52 <Camail> you just dont want to have to remember it
19:25:56 <Camail> which is one of the drawbacks
19:26:02 <Camail> which is why its balanced
19:26:14 <DoT`> the rule for item interaction not really meant so you can use it so you can drop and pick upa weapon every round
19:26:30 <DoT`> so as to abuse defence dulist
19:26:47 <Camail> you give up your item interaction pretty much permanently, you have to remember to do it, you have to end your movement correctly and maintain the same action order
19:26:52 <Camail> its not an abuse
19:27:16 <Camail> you are giving up a lot
19:27:20 <Camail> for an itneresting interaction
19:27:37 <Camail> there are multiple rules interacting here
19:27:44 <Camail> idgaf if you do it, I'm not trying to tell you to
19:28:01 <Camail> but its not a game-y thing because it looks really cool and you sacrifice a lot to do it
19:28:07 <Camail> its a character design choice
19:28:58 <Camail> you get an effective +2 ac that scales as you level without needing to use the weapon, but in turn you lose the ability to interact with any other item as long as you want that 2 ac
19:29:47 <Camail> its probably too complicate for a new player, sure
19:29:55 <DoT`> haha
19:30:56 <Camail> also with the caveat that you would have to split your movement, if you wanted to do this it limits your movement by 5ft, and it forces you to move around in the enemies reach
19:31:01 <DoT`> its not complex at all, i just see it as pedantic use of the rules in a way that will slow combat and not the intention of beignn able to interact with objects on your turn
19:31:15 <Camail> there might even be instances where moveming 5ft in any direction will provoke an aoo
19:31:34 <DoT`> but thats my thoughts on it
19:31:41 <Camail> 1. thats not what pdenatic means
19:32:19 <Camail> 2. it doesnt have to slow combat  down if you're fast about it, takes maybe two seconds to say "drop the dagger, make attacks, move and pick it up"
19:32:29 <Camail> its one additional sentence fragment
19:32:31 <DoT`> excessively concerned with minor details or rules; overscrupulous.
19:32:35 <DoT`> thats how i meant it

19:32:48 <DoT`> hey phear
19:33:30 <Camail> also there isnt any "intention" with interacting with an ojbect
19:33:35 <Camail> literally infinite possibilities
19:33:46 <Phearlock> Hi
19:33:52 <Camail> picking a weapon up off the ground is obviously one of them
19:33:55 <Camail> and has been sued before
19:34:27 <Camail> if you get disarmed and the weapon falls next to you it is an item interaction to pick it up
19:34:45 <Camail> the fourth example they give is "pick up a dropped axe"
19:34:58 <DoT|Phone> yes. but not every round agree dropping it every round
19:35:08 <Camail> ?
19:36:08 <DoT|Phone> we disagree on this. I've said how I feel. You see it differently.
19:36:13 <Camail> no i mean
19:36:16 <Camail> i dont udnerstand that sentence
19:36:32 <DoT|Phone> oh phone...
19:37:14 <Camail> thats fine? i just dont know what you were trying to say
19:37:36 <Phearlock> I think dot means he just realized the phone messed up what he was trying to say?
19:37:47 <Camail> ah
19:37:47 <DoT|Phone> You can't compare picking up a disarmed weapon to dropping and picking up a weapon every round
19:37:57 <Camail> yes you can? whats different
19:38:03 <Camail> both weapons are ont he ground
19:38:09 <Camail> in the real world
19:38:11 <Camail> comapre it to the real world
19:38:16 <Camail> it doesnt amtter how a thing got on the ground
19:38:27 <Camail> the rule for picking up an item matches the real life scenario
19:38:34 <Bio> I would assume that a disarmed weap would slide away or get knocked back.
19:38:39 <Camail> nope
19:38:50 <Camail> unless specifically stated disarming does not fling a weapon
19:38:52 <Bio> k
19:38:54 <Camail> also that doesnt amtter
19:40:20 <Camail> I'm just saying that 1. This combination of actions is well within each individual rules intention 2. it would makes sense to phsyically do all of these things as a progression of a turn 3. in doing so, there is a viable way to hpysically describe this combination of actions in a convincing way
19:40:53 <Camail> and there's no such thing as RAI for combinations of rules unles the designers make an on the spot decision
19:41:04 <Camail> which would most likely just be "its up to the dm" in this kind of case
19:44:55 <Camail> its no different from me accidently allowing skram to doff his shield as a free action, but there was a specific rule to disallow that
19:44:56 <Phearlock> I'm happy you guys had that conversation as I was a bit curious how that works
19:45:47 <Phearlock> Especially since my guy is sword & shield and would need to find some way to get a free hand for any spell with a somantic component =P
19:46:11 <Camail> you can put your sword in your shield hand
19:46:18 <Camail> shield are strapped to forarms, not held
19:46:22 <Camail> hence why they take ana citon to remove
19:46:30 <Phearlock> Oh, they're those kind of shields
19:46:34 <Camail> yes
19:46:40 <Phearlock> I guess it doesn't make a distinction
19:47:02 <Phearlock> I kinda miss having different types of shields, but it's ok for stuff to be simplified like this too.
19:47:26 <Camail> magic shields have different stuff, but thats about it
19:47:55 <Camail> also if you were to etch your holy symbol into your shield, any spell with a material component and a somatic component can be done with the hand that holds your holysymbol/focus
19:48:04 <Camail> that being said the drawbacks are clear
19:48:15 <Camail> you can be discreet about your specific faith if you are wearing your symbol
19:48:17 <Camail> cant*
19:48:33 <Camail> also if you put it away and dont have another holy symbol ur boned
19:48:46 <Bio> DuB` https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CiEkD61UYAA83Po.jpg:large
19:48:48 <Camail> and etching costs money
19:49:49 <Phearlock> will stick with the amulet I started with for now.
19:50:09 <Camail> ya, just putting it out there
19:50:22 <Camail> one of the bajillion tweets I've read
19:50:30 <Phearlock> Bio did ppl link you this pon yet? http://aosionpony.tumblr.com/post/139477201205
19:50:48 <Camail> I've gotten a pretty good sense at how the designers want the rules to be used, which is why i feel strongly about this combo
19:50:52 <Bio> they did now
19:50:58 <Phearlock> good
19:51:07 <Bio> how cute
19:53:44 <Phearlock> haha the new Sun & Moon starter pokes.
19:53:54 <Phearlock> No spoils, but I love how bored one of them looks
19:53:59 <Phearlock> "I am fed up with everything"
19:54:24 <Camail> .tell micen dissonant whispers has been deemed as "unwilling movement" so it doesn't provoke ooa
19:54:50 <Camail> apparently the only thing that counts is the person using some sort of action to move on their own
19:54:55 <Camail> which makes sense
19:55:07 <Camail> oh
19:55:12 <Camail> .tell micen nvm I'm wrong
19:55:14 <DoT|Phone> word of command?
19:55:19 <Phearlock> So command would also be unwilling movement?
19:55:23 <DoT|Phone> like pear used
19:55:44 <Camail> this tweet chain is contradictory
19:55:56 <Phearlock> Twitter plz
19:57:23 <Camail> "If a spell forces you to move, as dissonant whispers does, you're not moving of your own volition." then "The movement in dissonant whispers can provoke opportunity attacks, since it uses your reaction (PH, 195)."
19:57:35 <Camail> crawford please
19:58:18 <Camail> it seems the rule is "if the movement takes up an action from the individual, they are open to aoo's"
19:58:38 <Camail> that being said, if a character already used their reaction that turn, dissmisive whispers cant make them run
19:58:45 <Camail> because they have no reaction to use
19:59:00 <Rawr|Phone> I am excited phear
19:59:21 <Camail> also command uses their action so thats fine too
20:00:02 <DuB`> LOL Bio.
20:00:20 <DuB`> RYUU GA WAGATEKO O KUROIURAOIWBAOIBVOA
20:03:29 <Phearlock> Oh and regarding reactions. I know you get it back on your turn, but if it hasn't been your turn yet in the initiative order, do you have one?
20:03:50 <Phearlock> I would assume not, but was curious
20:05:02 <Camail> you have one until you use it
20:05:23 <Camail> now, whether or not you get one in a surrise round where you are not int he turn order
20:05:35 <Camail> thats an interesting question, they caught you flat footed, so probably not
20:06:06 <DoT|Phone> no reactions if you are surprised if I recall
20:06:13 <Camail> but even if you rolled a 0 on initiative you still have a reaction you can use at any time if its applicable
20:06:30 <Phearlock> coolbeans
20:06:39 <Camail> yea it makes sense that you need to HAVE a turn in order to have a reaction
20:06:44 <Camail> but that's the only requirement

20:28:09 <Camail> DoT`  if you want to use the d6 for the pear because you think its a pedantic as well then I won't put any pressure on you to do that either
20:28:13 <Camail> just play the way you want to
20:28:20 <Camail> spear*
20:30:01 <Camail> DuB`  yea they dont have all his lines in the game its really weird
20:30:14 <Camail> the one that sounds like a real person just speaking lines is probably a dev
20:30:27 <Camail> brb again
20:35:08 <DoT`> this is completly diffrent form the spear cam
20:35:20 <DoT`> i was tlaking about dropping and picking up a dagger every 6 seconds
20:37:18 <Camail> I'm not trying to convince you either way, while i think they are essentially the same thing in terms of how they interact with the rules, I was more  making sure you actually wanted to do that
20:37:27 <Camail> because when i brought it up to you, you didnt like it
20:37:31 <Camail> or it didnt make sense to you
20:37:39 <Camail> and i just wanted to make sure you were dong it because you wanted to
20:38:48 <DoT`> now im confused, I get how versatile and 2 handed are sprate, that 2-handed is a weapon thats so heavy it uses 2 hands and thats relating to the versatile rule
20:39:14 <Camail> versatileweapons allow you to attack with either 2hands or 1 hand
20:39:18 <DoT`> the other thing is the item interaction rule that allows you to pick up a weopen off the ground
20:39:24 <Camail> so you cant use the d8 if you dont have a second hand free
20:39:27 <DoT`> which i am also ok with
20:39:47 <Camail> but your second strike does note xplicitly state versatile weapons remove this game feature
20:40:08 <DoT`> im not saying you cant drop a dagger every round and then pick it up just that I dont see that particuler application as 'realistic' or how it shouldbe used
20:40:20 <Camail> why
20:40:24 <Camail> its realistic
20:40:27 -!- DoT|Phone1 [~Dot@0541c64f.skybroadband.com] has joined #tlponies
20:40:35 <Camail> i can tell you how it would work
20:40:44 <Camail> the second point is more important
20:40:48 <Camail> that you think its abuse
20:41:04 <DoT`> im not sure how you are connecting the versatile rule that we agree on, and the item interaction rule
20:41:14 <DoT`> which we also agree can be used in the way you state
20:41:29 <DoT`> just that I dont feel its should be used in such a way
20:42:17 <Camail> because they are both actions well within the rules, are optimized interactions between multiple rules, both actions are not explicitly related rules, and both action take a complex action in the game world to execute
20:42:30 <Camail> the dagger just takes one more step, its a difference in degree not kind
20:43:58 <Camail> you only need to weild a s handed weapon in both hand when you attack, so why does the rule say you cant unarmed strike when you arent attacking with the weapon, and why does a versatile weapon prevent this? you have to jump through a hoop to make it all make sense
20:44:05 <Camail> 2 handed*
20:45:26 <Camail> same thing with darkness + devil sight
20:45:37 <Camail> er
20:45:38 <Camail> well
20:45:39 <Camail> maybe not that
20:47:07 <Camail> but could be other combos that  are of the same type, but are such a higher degree that they break the game, I would disallow those even if they still kept the spirit of the individual rules
20:47:33 <DoT`> when i use a versatile weapon in 2 hands I am not using the item interaction, I am using my action for a weapon attack, feet and elbows are also unarmed strikes, 
20:47:49 <Camail> this isnt an argument about the specifics of the rules
20:47:53 <Camail> its about how viable the action is
20:47:58 <Camail> because both are equally legal
20:48:06 <DoT`> we are discussing our thoughts on using a dagger though and dropping it between attacks then using the item interaction to pick it up every round
20:48:16 <Camail> which you think is an abuse
20:48:22 <Camail> you are taking time out of your turn to do it
20:48:30 <Camail> it has real consequences
20:49:33 <Camail> versatile doesnt need an action but the rules are still interacting with each other
20:49:52 <Camail> in a specific way, specific rulings overriding general rulings
20:50:02 <DoT`> also if i take an unarmed strike its my bonus action, which can even be used to travel another 35 feet, the item interactoin is essentially free, no time space is really alloted to it
20:50:52 <DoT`> and I have no problem with picking up a weapon in that none time
20:51:02 <Camail> only used tot ravel 35 feet if you use a ki point
20:51:06 <DoT`> as the rules are very simplified in some ways
20:51:22 <Camail> nothing has time alloted
20:51:27 <DoT`> or are a rogue
20:51:32 <DoT`> or a fighter
20:51:39 <Camail> no single action has a time component
20:51:59 <Camail> if you make the Cast a Spell action, then that might have a time component if explicitly given
20:52:15 <Camail> but a fundamental designchoice makes everything have no clear time
20:52:23 <Camail> there is no reason for you to asusme an item interaction take no time
20:52:39 <Camail> especially because of the situation they give where a dm will sometimes not a low you to use the item interaciton to interact with some items
20:52:45 <Camail> aka a rusty door or draw bridge
20:53:02 <Camail> meaning that there is a short time component that can be ambiguously deemed too short for some actions
20:53:19 <Camail> and picking up a weapon is explicitly stated as not taking up enought time to warrant an action
20:53:29 <Camail> but still, no time component
20:53:31 <Camail> its all vague

20:53:55 <DoT`> no, but a round takes 6 seconds, and to me the idea of someoen dropping and picking up thier dagger every 6 seconds in a fight feels ridiculous to me when i imagine it. 
20:54:36 <Camail> because you arent picturing it being cool, i guess
20:54:43 <Camail> dropping a dagger is complete free
20:54:47 <Camail> picking it up takes time
20:55:10 <Camail> so as you go for the punch your handle relxases and the dagger falls as yo clanch yor fist to make the attack
20:55:24 <Camail> as you strafe to the side you bend down and pick it up
20:55:42 <Camail> there are cool fluid ways for it to happen
20:56:08 <DoT`> dropping a weapon and grabbing it out the air and usign that to block the pass someones defence is the type of 1 off thing that happens at the end of a fight in a movie, its cool. but for it to constantly happen every 6 seconds in every fight seems odd to me
20:56:33 <Camail> so why does it only happen int he movie once, why couldnt they do it all the time
20:56:39 <Camail> they're just that badass
20:57:17 <Camail> there is enough time in an item interaction to open a normal door
20:57:22 <Camail> that takes at least 1 second
20:57:31 <Camail> you can pick up a dagger in 1 second
20:57:55 <Camail> and it takes merely an afterthought to let go of a dagger
20:58:01 <Camail> fractions of fractions of a second
20:58:13 <Camail> you have people
20:58:17 <Camail> literally casting darkness
20:58:22 <Camail> makes a sphere of complete blackness
20:58:24 <Camail> and seeing through it
20:59:08 <Camail> i dont see how being a crazy ninja thats spinning around picking up and dropping a dagger is any more unbelievable than someone using a battleaxe to cut a giant in half
21:00:04 <DoT`> well its my line of suspensoin of disbelief
21:00:36 <DoT`> like i will accept a fire breathging dragon, but in the same movie not accept a guy getting  thrown into a wall and denting it and then getting up fine
21:00:56 <Camail> and that's fine, as a fellow reader of the game I believe your susepsnion of disbelief is inconsistant and not considering the in world correspondence of the rules to your actions
21:00:59 <Camail> as a dm, it doesnt matter
21:01:10 <Camail> I won't encourage you to play any single way
21:01:30 <DoT`> and i compltly agree if someone wants to use the dagger in that way they can, just that I dont like it
21:01:36 <Camail> also you are mistaking my poibt
21:01:38 <Camail> point*
21:02:02 <Camail> like in transformers
21:02:06 <DuB`> Corvettes are fun.
21:02:13 <DuB`> Like... if Tracer were a spaceship.
21:02:14 <Camail> its perfectly fine to think that a guy's glasses should break in afight
21:02:18 <DoT`> of course oyu are a corvette player dub
21:02:22 <Camail> but then still suspend disbelief for the fact that robots exist
21:02:28 <DuB`off> SPACESHIP TRACER.
21:02:31 <Camail> those are two different things
21:02:32 <DoT`> later dub
21:02:57 <Camail> clearly in this world a robot existing has nothing to do with the degrees or kinds of physics that would or would not break glasses

21:03:07 <Camail> so that suspension of disbelief is consistent
21:03:38 <Camail> but characters being heroic enough to do insane super human feats is a suspension of disbelief that also has the dagger trick in it
21:03:55 <Camail> defensive duelist has a prereq of 13 dex
21:04:04 <Camail> meaning that you are intended to be way more dexterous than a normal person
21:04:34 <Camail> the dagger trick is just another super human thing that can be done, and your decision to disbelieve it is inconsistant with the suspesnion of disbelief for super-human abilities
21:04:47 <Camail> that's my full point
21:05:29 <Camail> also, you cant have a feat until you are level 4, well above a normal humans abilities already
21:05:50 <DoT`> these character have to make acrobatics check to jump 5 foot rivers and climb fences
21:05:57 <Camail> with bonuses
21:06:00 <DoT`> they are above average
21:06:02 <Camail> and very very low dc for 5 feet
21:06:13 <Camail> so does a lvl 20
21:06:17 <Camail> thats a mechanic of the game
21:06:31 <Camail> and the 5% to auto-fail and 5% to auto-succeed is a very contentious rule
21:06:49 <Camail> because many people believe that the RAI is to make the super-human heroes not fail at simple tasks
21:06:54 <Camail> so DMs dont role for simple things
21:07:01 <Camail> there area lot fo things I havent made you guys roll for
21:08:22 <Camail> but trying to jump 15 feet, 20? from only a 10 foot startup thats super-human
21:08:29 <Camail> and its not terribly hard
21:08:47 <Camail> and rolling a 1 doesnt always mean "you tried and failed because you made a mistake"
21:08:58 <Camail> a vast majority of the time DMs equate that to a factor not under your control
21:09:16 <Camail> the dice are not a vehicle for your actions, they are just determining if your actions succeeded or failed, they are nott he action itself
21:10:12 <DoT`> http://rariedash.deviantart.com/art/LunaGuards-527026769
21:10:21 <Camail> thats a misconception that many people have with dnd, that fate is determined by the roll and no matter what you do, you level 15 barbarian who kills dragons, you can fail at a 10 foot jump
21:10:41 <Camail> but that single mechanic doesnt even come close to disproving my point that these are super-humans
21:15:31 <Camail> often times when someone rolls a 1 the dm will enact a penalty that has a save roll component, to show that despite the occasional failure the super-human quality of the hero (who could be fighting a lich lord right now) will overcome the unpredictable pitfalls
21:15:48 <Camail> I've forgotten to do this 
21:16:38 <Camail> ideally people should be making strength checks or dexterity checks to make sure nothing horrible happens after th initial mess up, unless there are specific circumstances
21:16:53 <Camail> like rolling a 1 while shooting something down a hallway with 2 people in front of you
21:17:17 <Camail> but thats the spice of life
21:17:44 <Camail> and i also tried my bes to clearly show that it wasn't just an idiot friendly fire
21:18:25 <Camail> its a hectic battle field with people bobbing and weaving and making unpredictable movements, in rare occasions friendly fire might happen even to heroes, god knows anyone who isn't an expert would do far worse

22:22:56 * skram slaps DoT` around a bit with a large trout
22:29:10 <Camail> rude
22:32:44 <DoT`> skram pls
22:36:47 <Camail> skram
22:36:50 <Camail> want big ship pew pew
22:37:00 <Camail> i have 1 code left
22:46:34 <DoT`> cam https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2j5qlg/final_version_of_my_5e_dm_screenplayer_cheat_sheet/
22:47:37 <Camail> hm, interesting
22:48:10 <Camail> I'll read it, its a bit more difficult for me to use seeing as everything else is also taking up screen real estate
22:48:27 <Camail> but it might make a good tab to have open
22:54:33 <skram> Sure Camail. My life is empty now that overwatch is over.
22:54:43 <Camail> gg
22:54:54 <Camail> everything is as it should be
22:55:26 <skram> Its TF2 with fancier hats and butts.
23:00:00 <Camail> I sated all my desires for class based goal-oriented shooters, sadly
23:02:30 <skram> its fun but I wonder how viable it is as a competetive game
23:02:39 <Camail> 20 tick servers
23:02:44 <Camail> as it stands, 0% chance
23:02:55 <Camail> hopefully they get better ones for comp play
23:04:29 <skram> eh dont know if its as important as its in cs considering theres a lot of different attack types, not just straight up bullets
23:04:41 <skram> but balancing 20 different heros seems like a bit of a nightmare

23:05:59 <skram> its not even released yet and theres like a bunch of proteams
23:08:04 <Camail> you didnt ask if it was going to be an e-sport, you asked if it was viable
23:08:07 <Camail> there will be a scene for awhile
23:08:10 <Camail> just like tf2
23:08:25 <Camail> but if they dont increase the quality of the servers, it will die
23:08:28 <Camail> or
23:08:36 <Camail> they do what painkiller did
23:08:41 <Camail> and just keep pumping money into it
23:08:50 <Camail> then it will live, but everyone will hate the servers
23:09:28 <skram> well id assume that with interest from major organizations blizzard would endevour to make it successful as a esport
23:09:49 <Camail> who knows if they'll do t right, tho
23:10:00 <Camail> part of the reason the tick rate is low is for people with bad computers
23:10:12 <skram> well that was for quick play
23:10:16 <Camail> they probably care more about that than comp play
23:10:17 <skram> who knows what comp mode will be like
23:10:25 <skram> seeing as it was disabled for beta
23:10:33 <Camail> if valve hasnt done it for csgo i doubt blizzard will, but there's a chance
23:11:25 <skram> 20 tick sounds awful but considering that theres different damage types it doesnt feel awful
23:11:32 <Camail> they prboably care more about letting more people play competitive than they do about increasing the server quality for the top 1%
23:11:42 <skram> i mean, i have no point of comparison but I didnt feel like there was any weirdness i could ascribe to it
23:11:46 <skram> in 200 games
23:12:01 <Camail> seagull had it happen to him in the 10 minutes i watched
23:12:13 <Camail> he reflected an arrow as genji and then died from it
23:12:22 <skram> eh fair enough
23:13:25 <Camail> also you know how much 128 vs 64 tick makes spraying feel different for pros, imagine what the game would feel like on a higher tick rate for characters that care about that
23:13:37 <Camail> not spray per se, but anything that involves movement
23:14:11 <Camail> who knows how it would affect tracer, whether it would be easier to track her movements or easier to shoot with her
23:14:47 <Camail> also i have no idea how good of a computer you would need to play on 64 tick, its a very pretty game
23:15:07 <Camail> csgo is ugly as fuck, to the point of being cpu limited on most PCs
23:15:16 <Camail> thats how they get away with it
23:16:00 <skram> true dat
23:16:14 <skram> and since its blizzard it has no support for custom servers and probably not LAN
23:16:31 <Camail> i 100% believe there will be a community for at least a year, or a full season.
23:16:58 <Camail> they are very experienced with making the structure for an e-sport, but the problem comes with their complete lack of experience in making an FPS esport
23:17:10 <Camail> they dont have much to draw from, unfortunately
23:17:45 <Camail> TFC was a fluke that never blew up but still had a solid comp scene, tf2 had a comp scene that died, cs and quake have nothing in common with the design of overwatch
23:20:51 <skram> guess we'll see how stubborn blizzard are then
23:21:27 <Camail> well the game looks fun for everyone woh plays it
23:21:32 <Camail> thats kinda the most important part
23:21:37 <Camail> in terms of its success as a game
23:21:42 <Camail> so I'm happy about that
23:21:45 <Camail> everyone seems addicted to it
23:23:39 <skram> sure, it will probably be a massive commercial success and they said that all new maps and heroes will be a free DLC
23:23:44 <skram> which is pretty great
23:24:16 <Camail> yea, I'll probably get it if it ever goes on sale
23:24:23 <skram> would be cool if there was a esports scene around it too.
23:24:50 <Camail> also for anyone who cares, when you are at 0 hitpoints damage taken only fail 1 saving throw, and criticals fail two
23:24:51 <skram> Which I suppose would be the only entirely new game to spring on to the scene?
23:25:05 <Camail> melee attacks on an unconsious body are auto crits
23:25:09 <Camail> but spell aoe is not
23:25:17 <Camail> i dunno about ranged attacks
23:25:40 <skram> I mean, starcraft 2 comes from BW which is old as balls, same with CS, LoL came from DotA, DotA2 came from DotA, quake has been around forever, and so has CoD
23:26:22 <Camail> I would say that this game "comes" from team fortress
23:26:43 <skram> Well not directly but similar enough I suppose
23:26:50 <Camail> it has the same 3 game types, class based, objective-based, respawn system, 6v6
23:27:15 <skram> and hats
23:27:25 <Camail> its obviously a different game in a ton of ways, but its parents are clearly tfc and tf2
23:27:27 <Camail> and hats yes
