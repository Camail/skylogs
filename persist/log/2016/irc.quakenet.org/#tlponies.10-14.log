00:33:46 <Dot_> new matcolville video
00:40:28 <Camail> i havent watched him in months
00:40:55 <Dot_> hardly puts out any videos now
00:41:10 <Camail> occasionally he gets sophomoric and it annoys me
00:42:19 <Camail> like, he just doesn't care about anyone else and just does w/e he wants. Which is 100% fine
00:42:29 <Camail> but as a viewer i have no interest in someone who doesn't care
00:43:56 <Dot_> i only watch his runnign the game videos, he has an interisting perspective that comes form so many years of diffrent dnd versions
00:44:25 <Dot_> his other stuff, eh, nothing i care about

13:57:08 <Dot_> this anime stuff you watch is weird
13:58:37 <Runbunny> It is pretty amazing though
13:58:57 <Runbunny> Those lectures are in Asstronomy and Boobology.
13:59:08 <Dot_> oh you
13:59:22 <Runbunny> Dude, I am not the one making this shit up.
13:59:52 <motbob> that would be the translators
14:00:40 <Dot_> http://imgur.com/gallery/kL2Wo
14:00:41 <Runbunny> Yeah... sadly it is only horriblesubs that bothers to translate this show :/
14:00:43 <motbob> "Asstronomy, haha, thats good. OK, now we need to think of a good course name that has boobs in it. [Two minutes later] Eh, I gve up."
14:01:35 <motbob> well there are about 5 shows that have been translated from scratch by fansubbers in the last two years
14:01:49 <motbob> almost all of them are based off of CR's or Funi's translations
14:02:11 <motbob> the exceptions are, generally speaking, the Monogatari shows and SNAFU 2

14:37:16 <Dot_> rawr
14:37:27 <Dot_> angel is making me sneeze
14:39:36 <Runbunny> Actually it is your immune system making you overproduce mucus which is making you sneeze.
14:39:45 <Rawr|Fone> Dot snela
14:39:57 <Runbunny> all thanks to the mast cells releasing their cytokines.
14:40:26 <Dot_> so how can i stop it angel?
14:40:34 <Dot_> besides killing you?
14:40:39 <Dot_> as we dont want to do that
14:40:56 <Runbunny> due to the IgE receptors bound on them, which are made by B-cells that are convinced that whatever pollen proteins are pathogenic towards you.
14:41:18 <Dot_> but apparently there are no polens aroudn in engladn this time of year
14:41:34 <Runbunny> anti-histamines are pretty good.
14:41:36 <Runbunny> Oh noes.
14:41:53 <Runbunny> You have become allergic to dust then.
14:42:36 <Runbunny> which is not actually the dust you're allergic to but an enzyme in dust mite feces called Derp 1.
14:43:00 <Dot_> well i cant argue with that, dust has always made me sneeze
14:43:19 <Runbunny> You're allergic to shit. I am sorry :/
14:43:25 <Dot_> oh dear
14:43:33 <Dot_> does this still mean i have to kill you?

18:36:01 <Runbunny> Dot`, I had to close my window... the heat has left my body... I now have nothing left.
18:36:53 <Dot`> i tohught the heat had long since left your body through your hollow inside
18:37:03 <DuB`> Through ANIME.

18:43:12 <Camail> cuz using humanbenchmark i was just able to consistently hit 210ms

18:45:04 <Dot`> game must update
18:45:08 <DuB`> That looks like a german word.
18:45:09 <Dot`> no angel
18:46:45 <skram> bnet did the thing where it waits for something else to install before it can update when there isnt anything else installing or updating
18:47:10 <Dot`> EU or NA
18:47:15 <Runbunny> Skram
18:47:22 <Runbunny> are you going to play?
18:47:28 <Camail> skram if you have another blizzard game on paused DL that might be it
18:47:33 <Runbunny> so we can decided on a region.
18:47:43 <Camail> i had that problem a lot until i finished/deleted the toher games download
18:47:53 <skram> ja anders
18:48:17 <skram> camail every game i own on bnet is paused because i cant be arsed to update
18:48:22 <skram> it usually isnt a problem
18:48:37 <Camail> cant you just prevent updates
18:48:50 <skram> maybe?
18:49:05 <Camail> i am fairly sure thats an option
18:49:11 <Camail> it usually is for anything with auto updates
18:50:14 <Camail> ya it is
18:50:21 <Camail> just checked, its in game settings
