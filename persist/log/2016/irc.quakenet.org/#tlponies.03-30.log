12:20:21 <DoT`> and you will be sad

12:21:44 <DoT`> the barber i went to had been cutting hair there for 26 years
12:21:50 <DoT`> thats longer than i have been alive
12:22:03 <CockRoach|42> haha
12:23:43 <DoT`> everytime i have a haircut i get reminded what a large forehead i have
12:23:52 <DoT`> its fine, its not like i am going outside inn this next week
12:25:29 <CockRoach|42> you should get shoulder length hair, DoT`
12:25:38 <DoT`> too much hassle
12:25:43 <CockRoach|42> it is :/
12:28:10 <Micen> get hair like the one picture i have
12:28:25 <Micen> the pompadour
12:28:43 <DoT`> that must have taken at least a year to grow
12:29:13 <Micen> lets see, the pic was in 2012 
12:29:21 <Micen> i didnt have a hiarcut since before middleschool
12:29:42 <Micen> so like a decade of hair growth
12:29:58 <Micen> so yes, at least a year is a fair statement
12:30:04 <DoT`> hahaha

12:31:53 <CockRoach|42> i had 40cm long hair after 4-5 years of letting it grow (and trimming it now and then)

13:49:57 <Rawr|Fone> Why do you have to work if you are in school dub
13:50:30 <CockRoach|42> because he's not in europe where univ is free
13:50:31 <DuB`> So I can have food and not die.
13:50:31 <skram> Because skool across the pond is sooper expensive rawr
13:51:10 <DuB`> I prefer not starving to death when I can avoid it.
13:52:05 <skram> Dont know man, im not sure what I would do if I had to choose between waking up at 3 and having food
13:52:34 <Rawr|Fone> Tough choice
13:53:01 <Micen> you can get food from other people and the government.
