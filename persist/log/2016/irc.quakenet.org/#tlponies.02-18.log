00:11:25 <DuB`> G'night reif!
00:11:37 <Camail> Crisium  is that map in the back a dynamic representation of the density of online matches?
00:11:50 <Camail> or is it just static art with random guesses
00:11:57 <Camail> cuz it looks legit

00:12:03 <DuB`> Dot.
00:12:09 <DuB`> Taeja's drops.
00:12:10 <Crisium> i've seen it change before, so i think so, but it probably rarely updates because they need server space and thats low priority
00:12:11 <DuB`> D:
00:12:36 <Crisium> whats funny is that its based on your IP when you first launched the game
00:12:43 <Crisium> they still think im in norway
00:12:44 <Crisium> lol
00:12:51 <Crisium> luckily match making is purely ping based

00:15:55 <Crisium> -_-
00:16:22 <Crisium> but he's right, its very satisfying and i occasionally do it as well
00:18:18 <Camail> he is entirely trolling

00:45:45 <Crisium> habs
00:45:51 <Crisium> or you saying they AHL
00:46:02 <ZK> im just being pissy
00:46:04 <ZK> cause we bad
00:46:10 <ZK> at least we still better than ottawa i guess
00:46:17 <Rawr|Phone> üçªüçªüçª
00:47:12 <ZK> maybe we can lose more and get a good pick, then get someone besides therrien in here
00:48:49 <Crisium> whats scary is theres a chance all 7 canadian teams could miss playoffs
00:49:21 <Crisium> canadians good at playing, bad at managing?
00:50:09 <ZK> i mean, price is for sure our best player, but we shouldnt be this bad even with him missing
00:50:52 <ZK> ppl blaming that we havent traded pacioretty or something to get a good player, or sacced all our players for picks or exchanged all our picks for good players
00:51:13 <ZK> which is silly cause our core is still pretty strong imo
00:51:37 <Bio> its def an anomaly
00:51:58 <Bio> much like hwere our offense went without schwartzy
00:52:43 <ZK> hm true
00:53:20 <Bio> i'm just super glad our PK seems to be on effing fire lately\
00:53:37 <Bio> going 7/7 pk vs dallas last night was sick
00:53:39 <ZK> i i feel like its a lot of it just being morale so low, its hard to get back up
00:53:42 <ZK> oh wow
00:53:48 <ZK> vs dallas? That sounds amazing
00:55:50 <Bio> yeh

01:03:15 <Camail> http://www.twitch.tv/teamsp00ky
01:03:49 <Crisium> its just a guessing game once she is in
01:03:58 <Crisium> at least for now until i figure her out
01:04:11 <Camail> guessing between what
01:04:25 <Camail> any character in this game has like 4 close range options
01:06:34 <ZK> so, how do you feel about sf5 so far?
01:06:50 <Crisium> i like it
01:07:10 <Crisium> quite the relief coming from 4
01:07:22 <ZK> whats the big difference?
01:07:58 <Crisium> no focus attacks or ultra, instead characters get unique moves
01:08:07 <Crisium> more wakeup options so less vortex
01:08:11 <Crisium> easier to do 1 frame links
01:09:07 <Rawr|Phone> I want to get it
01:09:17 <Rawr|Phone> But I have no time and no monies

06:04:35 <Camail> i think they changed something

06:05:49 <Camail> my internet should be good enough, and they say i get lvl 5 connections all the time

08:37:48 <motbob_> hey camail
08:37:56 <Camail> ya
08:38:08 <motbob_> how is it possible for the new KoF to look that bad
08:38:12 <motbob_> do you have any insight
08:38:17 <Camail> ok so
08:38:27 <Camail> they have been doing pixel art since the beginning of the series
08:38:48 <Camail> ok its gonna take a little time to explain this
08:39:01 <Camail> first we have to go down the road of what the company actually is
08:39:12 <motbob_> k
08:39:19 <Camail> laregely, its a pachinko machine company
08:39:34 <Camail> but, recently pachinko has been under pressure
08:39:43 <Camail> its been a secret form of unregulated gambling for years
08:39:45 <Camail> not so much anymore
08:40:07 <Camail> now they cant rely on pachinko machines for their main source of income, so they NEED to start making games more often
08:40:17 <Camail> I imagine this is not a good environment to make a game in
08:40:24 <Camail> so deadline pressures are real
08:40:40 <Camail> and they don't have a staff that's familiar with 3d modeling
08:41:03 <Camail> when  they worked on KOF 13 they had 3d models for reference, then made pixel art over that
08:41:16 <Camail> so the proportions aren't awful, but literally everything else is
08:41:30 <Camail> and they've been pushing developement like crazy
08:41:42 <Camail> its going to be a good feeling game, the gameplay is gonna be rock solid
08:41:47 <Camail> but it looks like garbage
08:41:50 <motbob_> that's a really good answer
08:41:52 <Camail> it looked way worse
08:42:08 <Camail> there's also the problem that they willingly showed alpha models
08:42:27 <Camail> the graphics have improved over the last few months
08:42:32 <Camail> but they are certainly still bad
08:42:42 <Camail> I believe the early screenshots are still circulating tho
08:42:58 <Camail> the king of dinosaurs doesnt look that great...
08:43:27 <Camail> http://gematsu.com/2016/02/king-fighters-xiv-adds-new-fighter-king-dinosaurs-maxima-clark-still-terry-bogard
08:43:31 <Camail> but he doesnt look awful
08:43:42 <Camail> its like, early ps3 maybe
08:44:59 <Crisium> Tizoc
08:45:19 <Camail> no shhh
08:45:24 <Camail> totally not tizoc
08:45:26 <Camail> not at all
08:45:31 <Camail> shush
08:45:59 <Crisium> i played him alot when i played garou on ggpo
08:49:44 <Camail> clearly not him tho
08:49:48 <Camail> move along
08:49:52 <Crisium> of course
08:49:59 * Camail pushes cris out of the room
08:50:12 <Crisium> he turned heel
08:50:36 <Crisium> he was hero of the mexican children in garou
08:50:40 <Crisium> now he eats the mexican children
08:51:42 <Crisium> Season 2 DLC confirmed
08:51:44 <Crisium> Abel, El Fuerte, Blanka, Twelve, Elena, Deejay
08:52:07 <Crisium> aka time to riot
08:53:59 <Camail> ur the worst
08:54:19 <motbob_> Where can I find info about sf5 mechanics like parrying
08:54:19 <Crisium> Elena's V Trigger is Healing
08:54:28 <Crisium> and her Critical Art is Healing
08:54:43 <motbob_> wait
08:54:51 <motbob_> parrying is character specific? WTF
08:55:02 <Crisium> v-skill replaced the button combo that did focus
08:55:11 <Crisium> each character has a unique v skill
08:55:31 <Crisium> only ryu can parry, but several other abilities are similar
08:56:30 <motbob_> why doesn't every fighting game have parrying? what's the argument against the mechanic?
08:56:47 <Crisium> see any argument against street fighter 3
08:57:49 <Camail> motbob_ first off, it depends on how its implemented
08:58:24 <Camail> its its just about hitting forward in a aspecific frame window, and you dont distinguish betwen mid-hitting moves and lows, then 3s happens
08:58:34 <Camail> where you option select parries and everything is awful
08:58:43 <Camail> (imo)
08:59:03 <Camail> but then there's the fact that it changes the way the game is played, and not everyone wants to play that game
08:59:24 -!- FlutterAi [~FlutterAi@adsl-98-93-53-146.owb.bellsouth.net] has joined #tlponies
08:59:27 <Crisium> it really changes street fighter
08:59:27 <Camail> footsies in neutral is a lot about rhythm and timing, parries play into that to a huge degree
08:59:43 <Camail> if you know when they are gonna rpess a button, you have a built in mechanic that gives you the solution to your problem
08:59:59 <Camail> which is why one of the best players in the word played Q, the worst character int he world
09:00:08 <Camail> he just KNEW you were gonna do something
09:00:11 <Camail> parried it, punished
09:00:24 <Camail> this makes the opponent scared and throws them off their rhythm, makes thme hesitate
09:00:44 <Camail> this all is coming from a hard coded thing that just says "no you cant do that move now"
09:00:56 <Camail> if you take parries away, you introduce more complexities
09:01:09 <Camail> because more creative ways of footsies need to fill the gap
09:01:25 <Camail> you need figure out ways for your character to accomplish the same thing without a universal mechanic
09:02:00 <Camail> this will rely on a normal move, which has a specific speed and a specific reach, this gives you the space you control
09:02:10 <Camail> and it might be a few normals, each with different speeds and hitboxes
09:03:15 <Camail> and that aspect of footsies is the one that parries override
09:03:15 <Camail> a character has to be balanced around parries, something 3s devs did not do
09:03:19 <Camail> big Band in skullgirls has a parry
09:03:22 <Camail> as well as ryu in sf5
09:03:23 <Crisium> Ryu SFV parry you can clearly see, and it has recovery, parry in 3S is tapping forward or down
09:03:42 <Camail> also no air parry
09:03:49 <Crisium> also that
09:03:50 <Camail> gouken also had a parry
09:03:54 <Camail> but his didnt lead into a combo
09:03:59 <Camail> it was really just a counter with armor
09:04:22 <Camail> parries also remove zoning fromt he game
09:04:29 <Camail> 3s arries,a t least
09:04:47 <Crisium> it messes with shotos
09:05:02 <Crisium> ken in 3s is just d.mk
09:05:05 <Crisium> lol
09:05:06 <Camail> 3s desnt have any top tier zoning
09:05:11 <Camail> the closest it comes is what, oro?
09:05:48 <Crisium> even he is about the hop attack a lot
09:05:54 <Camail> ya
09:05:57 <Crisium> remy is the closest
09:06:05 <Crisium> since he can have 2 fireballs active at once
09:06:10 <Camail> isnt remy shit tho
09:06:14 <Camail> like a good player can parry both
09:06:30 <Crisium> remy is low tier yes
09:06:44 <Crisium> but against certain characters and especially if he gets a life lead its not horrible
09:07:05 <Camail> the problem on a theory level, is the parries are like DPs without the downside
09:07:12 <Camail> how do i beat x? Parry and punish
09:07:14 <Crisium> but ya, pretty much everyones plan is to get in and rush, or better yet build meter and buffer it on fishing counter-pokes
09:07:36 <Camail> on a human level it works out
09:07:46 <Camail> the neutral game in 3s reacted to the strength of parries
09:07:56 <Camail> but it was a very limited and tense neutral game
09:08:14 <Camail> if sf5 had the same parry system it would be a ver very similar game
09:08:51 <Camail> but in sf5, even DPs have been nerfed
09:09:10 <Camail> most of them are uncancellable, and now they can get full punished for 40% life with no meter by most characters
09:09:24 <Camail> well, 30%-ish for no meter
09:09:26 <Crisium> not that much without meter
09:09:28 <Crisium> ya lol
09:09:36 <Camail> chun can get like 330 or something
09:09:41 <Crisium> oh wow
09:09:48 <Camail> technically
09:09:57 <Crisium> nash is low to mid 200s without meter
09:10:00 <Camail> you have time to jump after the big DPs
09:10:10 <Camail> lemme check waht she can get normally
09:10:26 <Camail> oops I'm in survival
09:10:28 <Camail> I'll check in a bit
09:10:33 <Camail> brb getting skins
09:10:44 <Crisium> most are mid 200s probably, still a risk/reward heavily in favor of the defender
09:12:30 <Crisium> 3s has lenient parry timings too
09:12:56 <Crisium> theres an ism in CvS2 that has parry, but its not that dominant, and it has harsher timings
09:13:14 <Crisium> i never followed it that often but i think it was rare to pick that ism
09:13:44 <Crisium> "grooves" i mean
09:15:19 <Crisium> ya, no one used P groove competively
09:15:43 <Crisium> probably cause custom combo supers are just too good
09:15:48 <Crisium> Alpha 3 plz
09:18:58 <Crisium> and roll cancelling was OP, thats right
09:19:06 <Crisium> things worse than parry
09:19:10 <Crisium> lol that game
09:25:54 <Camail> chun can get 288 from her close range CC
09:26:33 <Camail> like 220 from her farther range one

15:54:19 <Cane> skrma, if you like synthpop then CHVRCHES may be of interest to you. 
15:54:41 <skrma> I really really like the sort of synth/dance/80s-thing thats on susanne sundf√∏r's newest album (Slowly in particular)
15:57:42 <Cane> skrma, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Eo84jDIMKI | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNHxwSp-6Og | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4Nr54uDiek | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mTRvJ9fugM
15:57:50 <Cane> I can't find my favorite song of theirs on YouTube, ever.
15:57:56 <Cane> But it's a fun band.
15:58:30 <skrma> Yeah im listening now. I think I like this
15:58:36 <skrma> good suggestion
15:59:59 <Rawr|Fone> Royal blood
16:00:06 <Cane> I gave Halvgud their latest album for christmas and he really likes them too.
16:00:32 <skrma> DuB`, I dont like the dont like the crackling in the background that sounds like a dusty vinyl record and what sounds like running water :(
16:01:38 <Cane> I agree, that's obnoxious.
16:01:53 <Cane> It's such an annoying way to make the track dirtier, when I think it would suit being super clean.
16:02:01 <Cane> Good instrumentation besides taht.
16:02:31 <DuB`> Hmmm.
16:02:33 <skrma> I think I've become kinda boring in my musical taste, honestly. I listen to pop music even!
16:02:54 <Rawr|Fone> Waow
16:03:54 <DuB`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPh51zP0UhA
16:04:14 <skrma> I like ambient stuff Cane. Slow melodies drenched in reverb and stacked delays and whatnot. Like a lot of sigur ros stuff
16:04:52 <Cane> Oh hey, Purity Ring. I remember them from when I looked up the new synthpop scene.
16:04:59 <Cane> Didn't find any songs that really grabbed me.
16:05:14 <Rawr|Fone> Have you listened to Explosions in the sky skram
16:06:06 <Cane> Oh man, EitS has some good 65daysofstatic vibes some times.
16:07:21 <skrma> Yeah rawr. They have some good stuff, reminds me a lot of Bon Iver in that they have this sorta stringy ethereal quality to it
16:07:26 <skrma> Without the high-pitched lyrics
16:07:33 <Cane> Rawr|Fone, if you like Explosions in the Sky you might want to look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jxvy7W9bqo
16:08:12 <skrma> I like that a lot actually DuB`
16:08:21 <Rawr|Fone> I can't watch youtube links right now, but I will check it out cane
16:08:25 <Cane> Righto.
16:11:44 <skrma> EitS are playing rockefeller in june Cane. I might buy tickets once I get my work schedule
16:11:55 <DuB`> A little bit out of left field, but...
16:11:58 <DuB`> Most of what I listen to is pretty minimal and atmospheric... but I love Born Gold because they are the exact opposite of that.
16:12:03 <DuB`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50y0efALyh0
16:12:04 <Cane> Oh are they? Nice.
16:13:56 <skrma> I sometimes wish I live in Oslo. Sooo many good bands play rockefeller/centrum scene (which is the best concert venue in oslo)
16:14:36 <DoT`> you should stop living in a forest then skram
16:14:38 <skrma> But when I go I have to either drive or stay at a hotel since trains dont run home after 12
16:15:38 <Rawr|Fone> Lots of good bands play at kulturbolaget here in malm√∂
16:15:50 <skrma> I like the absence of other people too much DoT` :p
16:15:50 <Rawr|Fone> I'm gonna see ghost in a week
16:16:14 <DoT`> good point skram
16:16:18 <skrma> thats devil worshipping music rawr
16:16:25 <Rawr|Fone> True
16:16:25 <DoT`> ppl ruin everything
16:16:37 <Rawr|Fone> But I am a satanist after all skram
16:16:49 <DoT`> you like anime rawr?> i didnt know
16:16:52 <DuB`> Hah.
16:17:12 <Rawr|Fone> This is another kind of devil dot
16:17:16 <Rawr|Fone> Snela
16:17:21 <DoT`> Skarpning
16:17:32 <DoT`> Dont hide from the truth rawr
16:18:25 <DoT`> I have grabbed all the music links, becuase i need new music always
16:18:51 <skrma> Im going to see Sundf√∏r in Hamar in march, Cane
16:19:27 <DuB`> Does seagull's voice sometimes sound a lot like rael's or is that just me?
16:19:39 <skrma> I like her the bestest, I think. Ive seen her twice and they are the best concerts Ive been to
16:19:43 <skrma> Even better than Kaizer
16:19:57 <DoT`> its all american dub
16:20:15 <DuB`> >.>
16:21:25 <DoT`> dub, if 2 ppl look kida simler in the same movie, its garenteed i wil not be able to tell them apart
16:21:35 <DoT`> just having simler hairstyles is enough to lose me
16:21:42 <DuB`> Ahahahah!
16:23:11 <DuB`> I want the protoss oberwaj emblem.
16:23:17 <DuB`> But I don't think you can buy those with credits.
16:29:02 <carcinisation> at last i get a break after running into AA and KK

16:29:18 <DoT`> \o/
