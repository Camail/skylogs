00:00:11 <Camail_Phone> But i am here for dnd moral support
00:00:26 <DuB`> ;D
00:02:43 <DuB`> Oh, D3 season started today.
00:02:56 <DuB`> Huhhhhh.
00:03:13 <Camail_Phone> Pls
00:03:27 <Camail_Phone> Didnt anything interesting happen
00:03:36 <DuB`> Nothing at all.
00:03:45 <DuB`> Literally almost 0 new anything, besides the rewards.
00:04:12 <Camail_Phone> Boo
00:04:15 <DuB`> Also I'd only play for like 4 days before OW, so I'd not make it far in the season anyway.
00:04:31 <Camail_Phone> Rip the final diablo bastion
00:04:51 <DuB`> Hey, maybe next time. ;)
00:05:08 <DuB`> Also that sentence was more confusing than it should have been for me, with bastion being an OW character.
00:09:14 <DoT`> dub, do YOU have any purple smart to share?

00:10:27 <DuB`> Camail_Phone, should I remove spell descriptions from the actual spellcast/roll thing? It will show up every time I roll it.
00:10:40 <DuB`> Maybe not a problem, just takes up some space in the chat thingie.
00:11:23 <Camail_Phone> Meh only if you want
00:11:28 <Camail_Phone> Unless its a huge text
00:11:52 <DuB`> They're slightly big, I'll let you judge later.
00:11:53 <DoT`> summarise

01:01:26 <DuB`> OW is actually May 2????
01:01:31 <DuB`> Am confused.
01:02:05 <motbob> the overwatch subreddit is really slick and high production value
01:02:13 <DuB`> Reddit says May 2 4pm PDT.
01:02:13 <motbob> i can tell by how much it makes my browser hang
01:02:38 <motbob> When is Early Access?
01:02:38 <motbob> Early access will begin on May 3rd, and run until May 9th.
01:02:43 <motbob> When is Open Beta?
01:02:43 <motbob> Open beta will begin on May 5th, and run until May 9th.
01:02:46 <motbob> When is the release date?
01:02:46 <motbob> May 24th is the official release date for Overwatch.
01:03:03 <DuB`> EARLY ACCESS: The early access portion of the Open Beta will begin on all supported platforms May 2 at 4:00 p.m. PDT (11:00 p.m. UTC).
01:03:13 <DuB`> http://us.battle.net/overwatch/en/blog/20100169/#red
01:03:32 <DuB`> ????
01:04:12 <motbob> All early access keys will be distributed on or before May 2, 2016.
01:04:30 <motbob> it may be referring to when you get the keys
01:04:51 <DuB`> ... maybe?
01:04:52 <motbob> But, it does seem to be inconsistent
01:06:07 <DuB`> WELL.
01:06:10 <motbob> It may be that Blizzard doesn't want to advertise early access as beginning on May 2 when it will only be available for only a small part of that day (for Europeans especially)
01:06:14 <DuB`> I will be hoping for Monday. :D
01:06:21 <DuB`> Yeah, that's my guess.
01:06:27 <DuB`> Being 11pm utc and all.
01:08:05 <DuB`> MONDAY??? :DDDD
01:13:19 <DuB`> OW play button is blue, hahah.
01:13:28 <DuB`> False hopes~

03:48:26 <motbob> they were all bad (if they were battle.net codes)
03:49:07 <Camail> ...no
03:49:25 <motbob> ...
03:49:25 <Camail> they were dreadnought codes
03:49:44 <motbob> ...oh ...ok
03:50:00 <Camail> i mean, you prboably just missed the first line
03:50:04 <Camail> which lead to the confusion
03:51:11 <motbob> 5v5 spaceship tactical shooter
03:51:14 <motbob> that seems impossible
03:51:17 <Camail> it is
03:51:22 <Camail> but pew pew shiny ships
03:51:44 <Camail> its what people who dont play eve, want eve to be
03:52:01 <motbob> oh this does look like EVE
03:52:05 <Camail> which is perfect for my level of commitment
03:52:43 <motbob> this looks very, very hard
03:52:58 <Camail> any time i see people stream it, it looks kinda simple
03:53:10 <Camail> maybe they're playing it wrong
03:53:43 <motbob> i mean on one level you just point and click but when I see terrain and think about healing and stuff, my head starts to hurt
03:54:39 <Camail> eh, you can kinda apply the vague concept of map control, which gives you the language from other games you know
03:54:56 <Camail> line of sight is king, various ships have either fast speed or turtle speeds
03:55:05 <Camail> positioning is all about angles and isolating ships, i imagine
03:55:11 <Camail> similar to how counter strike works with team fights
03:55:14 <Camail> but much slower
03:56:02 <motbob> eve's battles are probably much simpler in comparison. Rather, the optimal plan was usually to simplify things
03:56:21 <motbob> because you couldn't count on even a small fleet to do everything optimally
03:56:40 <motbob> if the things you had to do were difficult, anyway
03:56:43 <Camail> having actual maps does introduce a new dimension, yea
03:56:59 <Camail> but eve has so much more complexity in fitting and different health bars, and mechanics
03:57:24 <Camail> i hope you're right tho
03:57:35 <Camail> would be really fun to have a ship game thats competitive
03:57:46 <Camail> but its will be f2p...so that might hurt it
03:58:05 <motbob> any game without a physical/reaction component won't be competitive
03:59:20 <Camail> to the degree you are talking about yea i agree
03:59:23 <Camail> I guess what i meant to say
03:59:29 <Camail> is mentally engaging?
03:59:41 <Camail> something along those lines
04:00:10 <motbob> well, if you want that then the beta's the place to be
04:00:13 <Camail> i have 0 expectations that it will ever have a competitive community that matters
04:00:57 <motbob> tactical games get figured out pretty quick
04:05:40 <Camail> http://i.imgur.com/tEtn5mM.gifv
04:08:15 <motbob> rip
04:08:51 <motbob> nice to see the russians are still doing their thing in the east after 6 years

14:03:23 <ZK> did dub and Phearlock get a copy of this? Cause if not, im wondering how they did their chars :P
14:03:44 <DoT`> they did
14:04:17 <DoT`> i just reinstalled this mornign, and it seems the onyl file i didnt back up was the dnd rules
14:11:33 <ZK> so, we got an AoE and a tank.
14:11:37 <ZK>  That will be useful
14:11:48 <ZK> and that tank is already maxed out on strength t.t
14:12:21 <DoT`> yea zk, those 2 got really good stat rolls :/
14:12:34 <ZK> cam let dub reroll cause his first was bad
14:13:28 <DoT`> oh yea, once we swapped to the 4d6 method we where not allowed a reroll
14:13:29 <ZK> well, 12 11, 9, 13, 10 10
14:13:32 <ZK> that skram level bad

14:24:35 <DoT`> camamail
14:25:12 <Camail> maybe
14:25:24 <DoT`> i found an easy way to set up macros
14:25:33 <DoT`> you can drag and drop form your character sheet
14:25:38 <DoT`> then rename it
14:26:01 <Camail> oh cool
14:27:16 <Camail> how do you delete them afterwards...
14:27:25 <DoT`> ah, thast why all the death save spam
14:27:31 <DoT`> i figured it out though
14:27:34 <ZK> where do i drop?
14:27:38 <DoT`> drag it far to the left
14:27:39 <Camail> bottom left
14:27:45 <Camail> below the avatars
14:27:46 <DoT`> and it comes off
14:27:48 <Camail> it will highlight a field
14:28:14 <Camail> oh
14:28:24 <Camail> you have to hover over the dark part that isnt part of the button
14:28:27 <Camail> thats weird
14:28:44 <Camail> cool
14:29:10 <Camail> yay
14:29:16 <ZK> hm nothing happening for me :s
14:29:29 <Camail> so drag and drop strength
14:29:29 <DoT`> you need to turn on the macro bar in settings
14:29:51 <Camail> ah, yea that might be the reason
14:30:29 <Camail> cool well, I'm off
14:30:30 <Camail> cya
14:31:24 <ZK> when dragging it, i have a weird name?
14:33:02 <DoT`> yea, thast the macro 
14:33:11 <DoT`> you can rename and rightclick
14:45:40 <DoT`> .when

15:12:10 <DuB`> Mizan!
15:12:36 <Phearlock> hey =D
15:19:49 <skram> ZK: Those rolls are better than mine
15:19:57 <skram> the first ones i mean
15:20:10 <ZK> i know
15:20:48 <skram> Even with rage, ferloks damage output is probably higher than mine
15:20:51 <skram> much sadness :|
15:21:23 <DoT`> if ferlock rolls a 1 for damamge and i roll max we both do 6 damage
15:23:09 <DoT`> well now i must afk, enjoy pony
15:23:12 <DoT`> :/
15:23:19 <skram> he also has higher chance to hit :p
15:23:38 <ZK> i need to seduce phear as fast as possible
15:23:40 <DoT`> yes
15:24:02 <DoT`> and has more life, and armour
15:24:10 <skram> how much charisma do you have zeke
15:24:12 <ZK> 17
15:24:26 <skram> you're roleplaying a autist with 17 charisma?
15:24:28 <ZK> orginally 15 though, that was my high roll i was so happy about
15:25:04 <ZK> shes charistmatic and ppl like her, shes just not savvy to the ways of the world
15:25:12 <ZK> charisma is all about being pretty
15:25:48 <skram> no?
15:25:56 <ZK> works for her
15:26:53 <skram> charisma is more about understanding people and using that to influence them i would think

17:33:56 <DoT`> you are 12 rawr
17:34:25 <ZK> isnt it 1? Usually a new party member starts one level under current party no?
17:34:44 <Rawr|Phone> I am 12 backwards dot
17:34:55 <Phearlock> I don't mind either way, will just ask camail
17:35:01 <Phearlock> he can pick.
17:35:07 <DoT`> but we decided as we are such low level they would be 2, they are still 360 xp behin dus
17:35:19 <ZK> oh ok, i wasnt there for that
17:35:35 <Phearlock> ok lvl 2 with 0 xp
17:35:53 <ZK> hm? wouldnt you still be 300 xp?
17:36:03 <DoT`> depends how you read it i suppose
17:36:17 <Phearlock> right, no xp above lvl 2 =P
17:36:17 <ZK> i mean, leveling up would be after 600 xp,
17:36:22 <DoT`> 300 total, 0 progress
17:36:30 <skram> yyyyy
17:36:36 <skram> 300 is level 2 and 900 is level 3
17:36:44 <ZK> i mean, with all his lifting, we can assume he was adventuring before thise
17:38:23 <DoT`> how tall is your half orc phear?
17:38:30 <ZK> twice your size
17:38:34 <Phearlock> I rolled 6 feet exactly.

17:41:49 <DoT`> waaat, you have like super crits lol
17:42:49 <DuB`> O_o
17:42:57 <Phearlock> Did I enter something wrong?
17:43:03 <DoT`> Savage Attacks. When you score a critical hit with
17:43:03 <DoT`> a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s
17:43:03 <DoT`> damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra
17:43:03 <DoT`> damage o f the critical hit.
17:43:16 <Phearlock> oh right the half orc thing
17:43:23 <Phearlock> That is a good ability
17:43:28 <DoT`> indeed
17:43:47 <DuB`> Very damage.
17:43:49 <DoT`> and Relentless Endurance. is cool

20:13:13 <DoT`> not as bad as 25 rand to the pound :P
20:13:28 <ZK> ouchies
20:13:52 <ZK> however, you didnt have your economies be equal for a better part of a decade, and then have all your prices go up without salaries changing :P
20:14:02 <ZK> Actually, you economy was pretty shitty all along, it can compare i guess
20:16:31 <DoT`> at times its been as low as 10 rand
20:16:50 <ZK> but when the rand goes down, does it affect the local economy?
20:17:08 <ZK> Cause we buy a ton of stuff from USA, so it's basically all our prices going up without our salaries changing
