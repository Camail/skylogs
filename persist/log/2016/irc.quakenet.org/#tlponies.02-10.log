00:12:49 <DoT`> no, i have a stream open now and check it now and then
00:13:11 <DoT`> and i watched when it first opned and ppl where looking at the new stuff
00:14:21 <Camail> cool

00:31:04 <skram> YOU'RE TOO ROUGH FOR TOM
00:32:39 <Bio> GREAT TITS AHOY
00:36:31 <DoT`> HUGS
00:39:27 <Bio> HUG THAT SHIT
00:41:21 <Camail> dot r u ranked yet
00:43:01 <DoT`> uhm nope, halv failed to show today
00:45:04 <DoT`> but i am curious if a smoke on mirage A bombsite, right in front of danger box is, it blocks site to t stairs from ct stairs and danger box
00:45:18 <DoT`> is any good
00:45:31 <skram> ???
00:45:43 <DoT`> well there is a lot of smokes to ct stairs
00:46:00 <DoT`> if you dont throw it as far it blocks of 2 places ct sit on site
00:46:05 <Camail> lemme visualize
00:46:37 <Camail> the problem with smokes int he middle of sites is that it allows the ct's to use them as well
00:46:47 <skram> danger box?
00:46:51 <Camail> triple
00:46:54 <skram> is that triple or ticket
00:46:55 <skram> oh ok
00:47:12 <DoT`> i had to look te name up on the http://imgur.com/gallery/a3cHR
00:47:18 <DoT`> as i dont know its name
00:47:25 <Camail> yea as you play you learn the different call outs
00:47:29 <skram> most common thing to do if you do a site hit is to smoke ct spawn, jungle and stairs
00:48:37 <Camail> ok so dot, that smoke is a real thing, but the problem is that is still leaves ct open when you get ont e site, ct is the fall back/ anchor position on a site, and it has full view of palace and site, which is the most important part
00:48:56 <DoT`> i got 2 smokes mixed up and ended up with this http://i.imgur.com/D0cnQzu.jpg
00:49:03 <Camail> a smoke inth e middle of site would block awps from posting up so they would ahve to move, but they could still find you and have an honest 1v1
00:49:14 <Camail> yea thats a smoke sometimes used
00:49:23 <skram> thats kinda situational
00:49:24 <Camail> you can plant in it, which is useful
00:49:41 <Camail> but its too specific of a smoke to use in mm
00:49:53 <DoT`> i was just curios, as i it doesnt show up as a smoke anywhere i have seen
00:49:54 <DoT`> ok
00:50:05 <Camail> someone at triple will just fall back to site and ct
00:50:56 <DoT`> also, there is no important  smokes for ct in mirage?
00:50:57 <DoT`> http://operationl2p.com/maps/de_mirage?page=1
00:51:01 <DoT`> none there at all
00:51:08 <DoT`> i have seen some elsewhere
00:51:33 <DoT`> but are they not worthwhile really?
00:51:53 <Camail> also anyone in the double box watching tetris has a great position if you throw that smoke
00:52:03 <Camail> because you can't flank them from sandwich side
00:52:56 <skram> I dont see why you would use that unless its a very specific situation or a clutch play. If you do throw smokes for a A hit you smoke stairs/jungle instead, which is far more effective
00:54:19 <Camail> I've seen LG use it a looong time ago on an a execute
00:54:42 <Camail> where they 5 man pushed out ramp to agressively take junlge and connector
00:55:01 <Camail> the smokes ct and dange box so they could get a quick plant on the connector side of the box while clearing out jungle
00:55:13 <Camail> so the planter didnt have to worry about getting traded
00:55:19 <Camail> its a unique push
00:55:25 <Camail> and only counters certian formaitons
00:55:28 <Camail> and its a blatant read
00:55:31 <Camail> but its a thing
00:55:42 <skram> Ive never seen that
00:55:56 <Camail> it was when they first started competing in the global scene
00:55:58 <Camail> before they were lg
00:56:02 <Camail> keyd, maybe
00:56:28 <Camail> but you save like 5-10 seconds by throwing that smoke for the planter to use
00:56:32 <Camail> which in pro play means everything
00:59:59 <Camail> planting there is the most defendable because you can see it from 4 everywhere but ct
01:00:41 <Camail> but th eonly way to get it there is to smoke it or clear the site which if you've already done that then its kinda a moot point because they're dead
01:01:54 <Camail> that being said, I've never actually done it because its way too involved...
01:02:16 <skram> Well its the sorta thing you cant do without practicing it

18:01:19 <Dot_> eh

18:01:44 <Dot_> really yolt? thats your argument for cats
18:01:51 <Yolteotl> OF COURSE

18:01:52 <skram> dogs are stupid and too noisy
18:01:58 <Dot_> they are not the slightest pony
18:02:02 <Yolteotl> they are like kpop for animals
18:02:09 <Dot_> dogs are smarter than cats skram
18:02:12 <Yolteotl> or starcraft 2 for animals :P
18:02:18 <Dot_> and less noisy when trained
18:02:25 <skram> i dont think thats actually true though
18:02:28 <Yolteotl> you don't have to train a cat
18:02:34 <skram> yolt, your analogies are shit
18:02:34 <Yolteotl> a cat will train you

21:47:30 <Runbunny> I am not sure
21:47:42 <ZK> you werent always runbunny?
21:47:50 <Dot_> always angel
21:48:12 <carcinisation> .u zk
21:48:14 <ZK> how about before we watched pony, huh? Then theres no way we could have called him angel after that!
21:48:15 <Runbunny> It's at least like 14 years since I started being Runbunny.
21:48:19 <Dot_> and he still hasnt said which hero is best
21:48:42 <ZK> also he is better than you, i like that reif
21:49:10 <Runbunny> I am hoping Mei gets cat ears.
21:49:15 <Runbunny> and D.va as well
21:49:29 <Runbunny> Also Mercy
21:49:42 <Dot_> mercy <3
21:49:54 <Runbunny> and reaper.
21:50:00 <Dot_> i dont recall any cat ears when seagull showed all the skins

21:57:15 <Dot_> here angel https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/44yln5/photos_of_all_167_new_skins_so_far/
21:57:31 <Camail> most fo the new skins are just recolors so meh
21:57:34 <Camail> but the new models are cool
21:58:00 <Dot_> yea, some of the recolours are nice though
21:58:35 <Camail> true
21:58:55 <Camail> everyone seems to have a green, purple, white, and black
21:59:13 <Dot_> and they must have plans for more skins as some like genji only have recolour so far
21:59:29 <Camail> its going to be how they make money, right
21:59:43 <Camail> or wait
21:59:49 <Camail> isnt it jsut gonna be a normal game
21:59:52 <Camail> i cant remember what they said
22:00:06 <Dot_> atm its just a buy at start
22:00:18 <Dot_> the skins and everything are unlocked by playing
22:00:26 <Camail> considering th enew models cost 1000 points and the recolors cost like 75
22:00:33 <Camail> I dunno
22:00:43 <Camail> seems like a very clear way to make currency buyable
22:00:50 <Camail> which I'm totally cool with
22:00:52 <Dot_> you can also earn credits form loot boxes to buy skiins/things
22:01:17 <Dot_> yea, im perfectly fine with stuff you can buy as long as it doesnt effect game play
22:01:32 <Camail> just the way everything is priced makes it look like you will be able to buy in game currency

22:18:37 <carcinisation> yolo <3
22:21:08 <ZK> ooooooooh im watching a zerg stream, and thinking hes not that good
22:21:11 <ZK> then realize hes diamond.
22:21:20 <Dot_> lol
22:21:20 <ZK> so anyhow, im at his level :P
22:21:32 <ZK> but he has 84 viewers :o
22:21:57 <Dot_> fame!
22:22:18 <ZK> he also complains a lot
22:22:23 <Dot_> bleh
22:22:32 <ZK> yep
22:22:35 <Camail> complaining instantly makes me turn off a stream
22:22:42 <ZK> kinda yea
22:22:52 <Camail> and when that happens 3 or more times I jsut unfollow and forget
22:23:05 <ZK> i never follow tho
22:23:12 <ZK> i just look on streams available and pick random ppl
22:23:19 <Rawr|Fone> It's probably why he has so many viewers though
22:23:27 <Camail> 'so many'
22:23:47 <ZK> i never get taht high, would you?
22:24:07 <Camail> how is that relevant
22:24:08 <Rawr|Fone> A diamond zerg getting 80+ viewers is a lot, yes
22:24:11 <ZK> i mean, i even turned off pengwin a few times when he starts complainin too much
22:24:48 <Camail> but its not a way to be successful, like objectively successful
22:24:49 <ZK> its so many for ppl of our low level, so yea thats why using us as subjects is relevant
22:25:10 <ZK> i feel like playin sc2 isnt best way to get viewers sc2 :P
22:25:30 <ZK> but i guess we have our niche
22:25:36 <Camail> all I'm saying is that most people are like us
22:26:02 <Camail> he can find 80 randoms that like it, but most people dont like whining
22:26:14 <ZK> yea thats true
22:26:19 <ZK> or so i hope
22:26:24 <ZK> althoguh idra...
22:26:40 <Camail> so yea I'm fine with downplaying whatever 'success' he's gotten by being this way, because its fake
22:26:52 <Camail> its insignificant and unsustainable
22:27:01 <Rawr|Fone> Avilo is one of the most popular sc2 streamers though
22:27:19 <Camail> most of the famous sc2 streamers were salty yes
22:27:31 <Camail> thats why i stopped watching all of them
22:27:41 <ZK> well, the most talked about anyhow. There are a lot of popular ones that arent salty
22:27:53 <ZK> mc tlo snute forgg all had good viewerships
22:28:08 <Dot_> polt
22:28:09 <ZK> hui and dragon also always pretty high
22:28:17 <Camail> but like, where even IS destiny anymore
22:28:26 <ZK> currently streaming CS:GO
22:29:06 <ZK> hm nope xcom
22:29:49 <ZK> well, its still his full time job afaik
22:30:16 <Camail> yea, but it doesn't look like he's growing
22:30:28 <Camail> there's only so many people who will watch an asshole
22:30:31 <ZK> oh yea no, that for sure has stopped
22:30:32 <Camail> and thats other assholes
22:30:39 <Camail> but if youa rent growing you are dying
22:30:43 <Camail> especially on twitch
22:31:19 <Camail> by being an asshole you limit the pool of viewers you are competing for
22:31:41 <Camail> so event hee few that manage to be successful, still can't be as successful as everyone else
22:31:45 <ZK> current favorite streamers for me are probably pig and fenner, both super nice and just looking to improve
22:33:08 <Camail> so i dont care how many viewers you get if you complain or you're mean, you're a bad streamer and will never grow if you stay negative
22:34:07 <Camail> fake rage is... kinda different, it taps into the 12 year old schadenfreude market
22:34:14 <Camail> which is, as we know from yutube, limitless
