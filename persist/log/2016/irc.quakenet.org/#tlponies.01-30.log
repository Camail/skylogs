00:00:20 <Camail> ya
00:01:02 <DoT`> i recall that scene being in, let me check
00:02:26 <Camail> hmmm
00:02:32 <Camail> yea it WAS
00:02:35 <DoT`> its there
00:02:36 <Camail> but not like, THE scene
00:02:41 <DoT`> ah
00:02:48 <Camail> i dunno
00:02:56 <DoT`> you mean the actual page taken out and put in like they often did
00:03:07 <Camail> http://www.mymanga.me/manga/OnepunchMan/21.3/3
00:03:11 <Camail> this thing
00:03:20 <Camail> like.... they CANT grasp the scene in anime
00:03:22 <Camail> anime is too fast
00:03:25 <Camail> it cant do this
00:03:27 <Camail> sadly
00:03:32 <Camail> anyway , food time
00:03:35 <DoT`> hmm, yea
00:03:39 <DoT`> enjoy food
00:07:26 <carcinisation> i return from chess
00:07:54 <carcinisation> bio is going to be pirate aparently
00:10:53 <DuB`> Reef, did you win?
00:11:05 <carcinisation> yes dub i won
00:11:11 <DuB`> :D
00:11:15 <DoT`> GM
00:11:20 <DuB`> 2pro
00:12:28 <carcinisation> remember folks "a knight on the rim is dim"
00:12:49 <carcinisation> ???
00:13:56 <DuB`> Wat.
00:14:30 <carcinisation> don't put yo ponies on the edge of the board
00:14:57 <DoT`> ponies tople
00:24:49 <DoT`> pony pony
00:27:54 <Camail> I still wish mumen rider was called lincensless rider
00:27:58 <Camail> like, with a passion
00:28:11 <Camail> It's so important
00:28:22 <Camail> to know that he rides a bike because he cant drive
00:28:43 <Micen|Stream> Cam, thoughts on Daigo vs Wong  2004?
00:28:58 <Camail> what, you mean evo moment?
00:29:01 <Micen|Stream> YES
00:29:04 <Micen|Stream> yes
00:29:05 <Camail> its historic
00:29:06 <Micen|Stream> caps lock
00:29:13 <Micen|Stream> yeah, was showing it to Dub
00:29:22 <Camail> it kept the third strike scene alive for another 5 years
00:29:30 <Camail> He's had to hve seen it before
00:29:33 <Camail> I'd be sad if he didnt
00:29:35 <DuB`> Yeah.
00:30:13 <Camail> the first time i ever saw it was way back on a artist's blog post on  newgrounds
00:30:20 <Camail> its very impactful
00:30:30 <DoT`> cam, in the manga he starts off being called mumen rider then later called that
00:30:39 <DoT`> but the misstranslation could also be in the one i read
00:30:44 <Camail> maybe it depends onth e translation
00:31:04 <Camail> the one i read was always lincensless rider
00:31:18 <Camail> i didnt even know who mumen ride was when i first started watching
00:31:49 <DuB`> Mumen means unliscenced. >.>
00:32:39 <Camail> I know
00:32:49 <Camail> but in the dub it cant be his name
00:32:55 <Camail> the point is that the english readers know
00:33:00 <Camail> because it adds to his character
00:33:08 <Camail> but he's just albelled as "mumen"
00:33:14 <Camail> which means nothing to us
00:33:28 <DuB`> Ah.
00:33:41 <Camail> check ur fucking pirvaledge
00:34:02 <DoT`> hurry up and read dub
00:34:18 <Rawr|Phone> Dot

01:16:03 <BioSC> many fire, much wow
01:17:02 <Camail_> DoT`  rereading post-anime opm, blizzard is literally Storm from xmen
01:17:05 <Camail_> like http://www.mymanga.me/manga/OnepunchMan/42/7
01:17:12 <Camail_> that is almost a tracing of storm's classic pose
01:17:19 <Camail_> it might even BE a tracing
01:17:47 <DoT`> haha, thats true actually
01:17:52 <Camail_> also tatsumaki > tornado as a name
01:18:07 <DoT`>  tatsumaki have a meaning?
01:18:11 <Camail_> dealing with JP naming vs translation is a real struggle
01:18:12 <DoT`> well i guess it must
01:18:16 <Camail_> its tornado
01:18:23 <Camail_> just like mumen
01:18:31 <DoT`> oh, right, 
01:18:42 <DoT`> im bad at names, i thought you meant the sisters name was better
01:18:50 <Camail_> but calling her tatsu is 1. cuter and 2. fighting games so thats cool
01:19:22 <Camail_> fubuki is blizzard, dunno which one i like more
01:19:28 <Camail_> blizzard is cooler sounding
01:20:34 <DuB`> hydra 1-0 state, uh oh. D:
01:20:55 <DoT`> hmm, im not actually sure how exaclty its pronounced, but off the top of my head Blizzard sounds cooler

14:47:49 <Dot_> i know nothing about the game, but saw he was playing it
14:48:07 <Dot_> well if you recomend it then i think  i will check out his playthrough on youtube
14:52:35 <Lynda> I didn't want to watch too much not to get spoiled for when I'll play it myself
14:52:40 <Lynda> but yeah I think I can recommend it

14:58:43 <Dot_> we had an african grey once
14:58:52 <Dot_> birds are bastards
15:00:16 <Lynda> xD
15:00:23 <Lynda> just don't talk about secret stuff around them :P
15:00:32 <Dot_> haha
15:01:10 <Dot_> they require constant attention, which i tihnk everyone knows, but then they are really nice to the person that gives them the attention, happly bite anyone else at random
15:01:21 <Lynda> xD
15:01:35 <Dot_> you dont have 8 hours a day just for them?  well they somehow learn to screech
15:02:07 <Dot_> and the mess!
15:02:15 <Dot_> they dont as much eat food as spit it around
15:02:48 <Dot_> never get a parrot, they only seem like a good idea to those that havnt had one
15:02:49 <Dot_> lol
15:02:51 <CockRoach|42> so angry
15:02:59 <Lynda> yeah I won't ever get any pets
15:03:10 <Lynda> but it's fun to watch youtube vids of them copying even devices' sounds
15:03:22 <Lynda> heard some birds can even copy like chainsaw sounds and such
15:03:23 <Lynda> pretty insane
15:03:58 <Dot_> well there is the australian bird that mimics everything
15:04:15 <Dot_> even the sound thier traffic lights make when its safe to walk
15:04:21 <Lynda> xD

17:17:05 <ZK> .roll d20 to boop Dot_
17:19:41 <ZK> i played dnd last night
17:19:55 <ZK> first thing i do, i kinda ruin my DM's plans. 
17:20:03 <ZK> I feel he needs to plan less when im playing
17:21:40 <carcinisation> either that or he needs to drop rocks on you :p
17:23:20 <Dot_> zk sounds like a bad player
17:23:44 <Dot_> http://www.twitch.tv/basetradetv
17:32:34 <ZK> Scene start: Your character ran the night and enters the tavern where another PC is in. Barman tells me to get out. My character gets out, scared as all. Other PC doesnt give a shit. DM is like uhhhhhh, that's not what was supposed to happen
17:33:17 <ZK> also, my char's family just died prior to me running through the night, so yea.
17:37:37 <Dot_> well that sounds like you are being mean to an inexperienced dm
17:38:44 <ZK> he fully DMed 2 campaigns with us before, but in a different system
17:38:45 <Dot_> i mean he should have seen that as what somone like you would do
17:39:48 <ZK> I always felt DMing should be doing the setting, letting the narrative to the players, but he ha a story in mind that we more or less have to follow
17:39:58 <Dot_> http://shamanguli.deviantart.com/art/Derelict-587585195
17:39:58 <ZK> It'll be interesting as this goes on
17:40:24 <Dot_> .tell Zounds http://karasunezumi.deviantart.com/art/Filly-Applejack-393551230

21:52:00 <Crisium> yay beta
21:52:03 <Crisium> playing it nao
21:52:25 <DoT|Phone1> gl hf
21:52:41 <Camail> dub y/n
21:52:46 <DuB`> Sure!
21:53:28 <Crisium> i think my lame vega throws ppl off because most as rushdown now
21:53:33 <Crisium> i will be as lame as is possible
21:53:59 <Camail> what happens in the mirror match
21:54:21 <Crisium> im 1-1 in mirror
21:54:48 <Camail> i ahve no idea who I'll play
21:54:51 <Camail> absolutely not ryu
21:54:58 <Camail> not gonna use the parry
21:55:08 <Camail> so not gonna gimp myself fromt he start
21:55:26 <Crisium> best player iv played so far was a ryu
21:55:57 <Crisium> but i think the character is definitely hard to play right
21:56:08 <Crisium> his fireball without v trigger is trash

21:57:07 <Crisium> whats funny is that almost every character can parry fireballs
21:57:20 <Crisium> v skill usually negates fireballs
21:57:47 <Camail> I dont mind, honestly
21:57:53 <Camail> i dontt hink it actually does anything to fireballs
21:58:04 <Camail> because you could always neutral jump
21:58:46 <Crisium> tru
21:59:16 <Camail> also negating fireballs means its not on the screen
21:59:26 <Camail> so you can fireball again
21:59:40 <Camail> neutral jumping it it still better at 75% screen, imho
22:00:07 <Camail> and lmao you aren't gonna counter the fireball in footsies, thats a waste of effort
22:00:22 <Camail> you get nothing from it
22:00:41 <Crisium> with vegas v skill he goes thru it, maybe negate wasnt the right word
22:01:07 <Camail> his v skill or his v trigger
22:01:16 <Crisium> whatever MP+MK is called
22:01:18 <Camail> I was mroe talking about what bison has
22:01:23 <Camail> and what a few others have
22:01:33 <Camail> like a shitty version of rose's absorb
22:01:36 <Crisium> i think most negate, ya
22:01:53 <Crisium> vega goes thru though, just gets temporary projectile inv i think
22:02:04 <Camail> is that the rose throw
22:02:11 <Crisium> no, its a claw attack
22:02:22 <Crisium> rose throw is the v trigger (HP+HK)
22:02:26 <Crisium> if im not mixing them up lol
22:02:35 <Camail> seems right
22:02:52 <Camail> v skill beats meter, v trigger is the expending move
22:02:56 <Camail> builds*
22:03:39 <Crisium> ok, im using the terms rite then

22:32:55 <skram> I rerolled crusader dub
22:33:25 <Dot_> how many days till xcom?
22:33:51 <skram> The cool thing is that you can do LoN build which is a non-set thing and your ancient legendaries give you lots of dmg/toughness and you can do what you want (thorns bombs shields whaeva)
22:34:07 <skram> The problem with that is that all my ancient legendaries have dex on them
22:34:28 <Phearlock> 6 days Dot_
