04:41:45 <Camail> oh god, apparently the average bitrate for all us ISPs is 2.35mbps
04:42:37 <Camail> so any non-partnered streamer trying to be "professional" and streaming at 1080p 3.5k is actually ruining themselves
04:42:51 <Camail> or even 720 3.5k

21:02:18 <Dot`> how was outsde?
21:02:24 <Dot`> cam, du er en hest
21:02:37 <Camail> 1. that close neough to german
21:02:39 <Camail> 2. no
21:02:40 <skram> cold and boring
21:04:40 <Dot`> cam, which is also simler to dutch which afrikaans is a derivitive of. Im now less immpressed when someone knows like 6 languages and they are all European laungages
21:05:05 <Camail> either its a romantic language or a germanic language, really
21:05:26 <Camail> english is more german than some part of german
21:06:00 <Camail> the word "window" is derived from old german, modern german uses a roman derived word
21:06:17 <Camail> thats 90% of what i remember from college german
21:06:33 <Dot`> lol
21:08:06 <Dot`> i never knew really reliased how much languages croeed, because in africa its english , afrikaans and 12 African languages that are completly seprate
21:08:41 <Camail> maybe the way african tribes work affected that
21:09:04 <Dot`> they did enjoy thier fighting
21:09:10 <Camail> europe has always had latin, which is what most academics used to communicate
21:09:29 <Camail> and most languages are derived from a single empire language
21:09:33 <Camail> guess africa didnt have that
21:09:54 <Rawr|Fone> I thought window came from the swedish word vind√∂ga
21:10:00 <Camail> there were a few empires tho, like the zulu
21:10:01 <Rawr|Fone> Did my teachers lie to me
21:10:37 <skram> maybe said word is derived from old german
21:10:45 <Zounds> We call young kids bairns here rawr
21:10:47 <Zounds> similar to swedish
21:11:37 <Rawr|Fone> Lots of scandinavian words got into english during the viking raids
21:14:33 <Camail> ok so
21:14:39 <Camail> swedish is a germanic language
21:15:04 <Camail> and window came from a norse etymology
21:15:17 <Camail> but i cant easily find anything going farther back
21:15:30 <Dot`> sweish or scandnavian? i tohught all scandanavian languages came form one root
21:15:50 <Camail> they are all norther germanic languages
21:16:00 <Camail> i just said swedish because rawr said swedish
21:16:19 <Dot`> ah
21:16:21 <Camail> "North Germanic, including Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Faroese; and East Germanic,"
21:17:06 <Bio> hi
21:17:07 <Camail> but many germanic languages adopted the latin "fenestra" for window
21:17:18 <Camail> meanwhile english didn't
21:17:29 <Dot`> so why is german a base for so many languages?
21:17:30 <Camail> so its more OG german than german
21:17:37 <Camail> same reason latin is
21:17:41 <Camail> they took shit over and spread
21:17:53 <Camail> and never died
21:17:58 <Dot`> latin is due to romans i guess
21:18:01 <Camail> no matter how hard the romans tried
21:33:05 <Golly> the barbarians won civ basically
