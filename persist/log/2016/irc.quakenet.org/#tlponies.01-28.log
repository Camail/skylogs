00:21:13 <motbob> Why did picarto get an edge over other streaming sites re" art?
00:21:42 <motbob> porn?
00:22:06 <Micen|stream> they were the first really dedicated to streaming art. 
00:23:41 <Phearlock> Think it was decent streaming service for art+allowing NSFW stuff yeah.
00:24:51 <DoT`> twitch didnt allow art til recently i heard
00:24:55 <DoT`> for whatever reason
00:25:11 <Micen|stream> yeah, people would get their streams shut down. 
00:25:25 <Micen|stream> until they added the art section. 
00:25:25 <Phearlock> There had been art-y NSFW streaming sites before that, but i remember them being very low quality.
00:27:00 <Micen|stream> I just jumped on this one because its waht i saw other people using
00:32:08 <Camail> twitch allowed art if it was game related
00:32:12 <Camail> for years
00:32:33 <Camail> there was a popular (by the days stadard) 3d artist on twitch in 2010
00:32:44 <Camail> but they made an actual push for art this year
00:33:14 <DoT`> SD was saying he stoppe dstreaming art on twitch as they use to have something in thier rules about it
00:33:33 <Camail> yea he drew ponies and dragons
00:33:34 <Camail> not game art
00:33:39 <DoT`> yea
00:33:55 <Camail> there were multiple art streams that i would watch over the last 6 years that were allowed
00:34:15 <Camail> pokket has streamed cosplay for a long time

05:12:47 <Crisium> nuclear power
05:12:51 <Crisium> much better
05:13:04 <Crisium> and you can even get nukes and then no one will declare war on u
05:13:41 <Micen_> I declare war on Skram.
05:14:08 <Crisium> moosen
05:14:15 <Micen_> yes?
05:14:21 <Micen_> Its not like he has nukes. 
05:14:22 <skram> nuclear power is super dangerous and really bad for the enviroment so we cant have that and sully the extraordinary beauty of the norwegian landscape
05:14:34 <Crisium> lets be nice to our scandinavian underling
05:14:41 <skram> getting rich from selling oil/gas and weapon systems to 3rd world countries is fine though.
05:14:52 <Crisium> he doesnt realize that all the nuclear waste ever made by american could fit in a football stadium
05:15:04 <Crisium> such bad environment
05:15:08 <Crisium> OSfrog
05:15:59 <Crisium> we can blast it into space
05:16:05 <Crisium> make the space french worry about it
05:16:17 <Crisium> the only real problem is meltdowns
05:16:31 <Crisium> but, worst case scenario you have mutant powers
05:16:49 <skram> yeah like a 3rd hand growing out of your stomach
05:17:14 <Micen_> that would be sweet. theen I could two hand type while using mouse/drawing
05:17:24 <skram> or are the superhuman vodka drinking abilities of the russians due to chernobyl
05:17:32 <Micen_> Yes.
05:17:47 <skram> but i dont even like vodka
05:18:18 <Crisium> i prefer kentucky bourbon
05:18:35 <Crisium> which i may or may not be drinking right nao
05:18:38 <skram> i like scotch.
05:18:53 <Crisium> scotch is too fancy for me
05:19:02 <Crisium> need my booze made in the mountains by hillbillies

05:19:44 <Micen_> thats the answer to all of them
05:19:47 <Crisium> lol
05:19:51 <skram> doesnt jim beam own everyone that makes bourbon
05:19:52 <Crisium> they all in the same county?

05:20:03 <Micen_> i am just situated in the middle of them
05:20:24 <Micen_> also yeah 25 miles and i hit any distellery. 
05:20:29 <Micen_> but i am in a dry county.
05:20:32 <Crisium> WHAT
05:20:40 <skram> ???
05:20:40 <Crisium> how is that allowed
05:20:49 <Micen_> look it up. LaRue County Kentucky 
05:20:53 <Micen_> we are dry.
05:20:55 <Crisium> i weep for you
05:21:05 <Micen_> no liquor sales allowed in county borders.
05:21:14 <Micen_> have to drive all of ten minutes to get to one 
05:21:22 <Crisium> all the stores just on the border must be happy
05:21:32 <Micen_> granted they mark up because they know they are closer to us than anyone else.
05:21:46 <Crisium> i have to drive 4 mins to get booze and i consider it a long journey :P

16:59:05 <DoT`> hows From the depths going phear?
16:59:24 <Phearlock> I finished up building a thing I've been working on recently
16:59:30 <Phearlock> Posted a screenie in the discord chat
16:59:41 <DoT`> what you do with it after? 
17:00:08 <DoT`> pretty boat
17:00:18 <Phearlock> Oh it's saved now so I load it up and use it in the campaign later if I need it/have the resources.
17:00:53 <DoT`> ah. so there is a campaighn
17:00:57 <Phearlock> From the depths doesn't quite work the same way minecraft does in that you only have 1 of the thing, after you finish up a blueprint it's saved.
17:01:26 <Phearlock> Which is nice as it'd be annoying to have to rebuild it by hand after all the times the things blow up during combat tests =)
17:01:29 <DoT`> so you can build multiple of this thing in a mission?
17:01:45 <Phearlock> Yeah all the blocks cost a certain amount of resources.
17:02:31 <Phearlock> So just need that amount of resources and some construction facilites in the campaign and you can use anything you have saved.
17:02:46 <Phearlock> Or just spawn them in the editor and pit them against other things =P
17:03:30 <Phearlock> It's about 10300 blocks, which is a bit much for a cruiser sized vessel, but the hull is pretty packed with stuff.
17:03:40 <DoT`> there are space ppl in this game?
17:03:49 <DoT`> im just watchign the steam trailer tihng
17:04:21 <Phearlock> It's pretty sandboxy atm as it's still alpha. But it's sci-fi
17:04:48 <Phearlock> you can build ships, subs, planes, spaceships, buildings etc
17:04:52 <DoT`> so in a mission, you start with X amount of resources and thats it or you gather?
17:05:19 <Phearlock> In the campaign you start with a base in a resource field and that'll always get you resources
17:05:47 <DoT`> ah
17:05:51 <Phearlock> then you can to capture more resource fields, or capture/destroy other vessels and that gives you resources too
17:06:18 <DoT`> so rts game with a massive desighn focus 
17:06:43 <Phearlock> Yeah you could play it totally as an RTS if you wanted.
17:07:03 <Phearlock> But is fun to build things =3
17:07:28 <Phearlock> I think I still have 2 steam codes for this if anyone wants to play it.
17:08:37 <DoT`> right now i dont think i would give it the hours it deserves
17:08:50 <Phearlock> Yeah it does suck hours =P
17:09:17 <Phearlock> Been playing it on and off, but played it a lot lately, still waiting for xcom 2 =)
17:09:25 <DoT`> so soon
17:10:16 <DoT`> all the ppl who got early access just sitting on gameplay footage they cant show for legal reasons

17:31:20 <DoT`> gg
17:31:34 <DoT`> that was badly handled
17:31:54 <reification> hi apm (adepts per minute)
17:32:29 <DoT`> those could have been any unit i feel
17:32:38 <DoT`> scv's are not great at fights
17:33:38 <reification> scvs are excellent at fights 
17:33:45 <reification> hence all the pulling the boys
17:34:46 <DoT`> lol
17:35:50 <reification> can’t do the positioning vs adept shades, they have range and light damage so doesn’t work
17:36:17 <reification> and too high dps for auto repair/hold position micro
17:36:42 <DoT`> if that amount of resources of lings was attacking the scv's and a tank same thing occurs though
17:37:31 <DoT`> adept nerf soon
17:37:34 <DoT`> tomorow i think it is
17:37:39 <DoT`> 3 shot scv time
17:37:53 <DoT`> then zerg can complain becuase they still get 2 shot
17:37:55 <DoT`> :P
17:38:02 <reification> but that amount of lings couldn’t get in so easy
17:39:26 <DoT`> no, how he got in there i agreee was adept sillyness

20:14:50 <DuB`> I haven't bothered ingesting bacon or milk since... as far back as I can remember.
20:14:56 <DuB`> Nopenopenop.
20:15:47 <Micen|Droid> Skram. Its america. Booze is more than welcome. 
20:15:47 <Yolteotl> then, it's not american bacon
20:16:09 <Yolteotl> you say bacon for almost every stuff coming from pig :P
20:16:19 <skram> do you mean flæsk
20:16:36 <skram> more like the english breakfast bacon thing

20:17:43 <Yolteotl> .
20:18:41 <skram> is it the same as lard
20:19:02 <DuB`> Lardon and lardoff are two varieties of lard?
20:19:23 <skram> is lardon a bacon induced erection?

22:46:03 <DoT`> american
22:46:12 <Phearlock> can see an alien and sorta transmit its position to me.
22:46:20 <Phearlock> Cause it's all by itself
22:46:24 <DoT`> Doggy!
22:46:26 <Phearlock> and spots an ayy on the other side of the map
22:46:32 <Phearlock> and not enough time units to run away to cover
22:46:54 <BioSC> magic
22:46:55 <Phearlock> So I fire a grenade launcher over the UFO to the other side of the map and (thankfully) hit the alien, killing it.
22:47:10 <Phearlock> and I'm like, did the dog relay like the MGRS coords for that strike?
22:47:12 <Phearlock> How?
22:47:24 <DoT`> http://www.fairyist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dog-pointing.jpg
