01:43:30 <DuB`> Nathanias solo cast is fun.
01:43:39 <DuB`> Relaxed and honest, I like it.
01:45:08 <Camail> DoT`  dont learn those
01:45:20 <DoT`> im not
01:45:33 <DoT`> thats why i was happy when i saw this one
01:45:41 <Camail> did you ever look at http://operationl2p.com/
01:45:54 <DoT`> nope
01:45:57 <Camail> there's a different xbox smoke that I know thats less annoying to set up
01:46:04 <Camail> i dont like aligning floor textures
01:46:09 <Camail> looking down in csgo is annoying
01:46:20 <Camail> well yea, thats a repository for smokes
01:46:53 <DoT`> i grabbed the youtube loink in the cs go wiki
01:46:58 <DoT`> for smokes
01:47:16 <Camail> consideirng your findings, this site isb etter
01:47:23 <Camail> lots of crosshair set ups
01:47:23 <DoT`> and then specific searches sometimes
01:47:27 <DoT`> cool
01:48:14 <Camail> the T smoke on inferno from banan to ct is actually bad tho, i used to use it
01:48:20 <Camail> but now i lower my crosshair a bit
01:48:34 <Camail> because their smoke bounces off the roof so it takes 1 second longer to bloom
01:48:43 <Camail> which is such a waste of time during an execute
01:48:44 <DoT`> this site is very cool
01:49:08 <Camail> I'm kinda sad you didnt find it, its simple and not comprehensive, but its valuable for the newest players
01:49:29 <Camail> it is the first result on goold for csgo smokes, tho
01:49:35 <Camail> so maybe its your fault
01:50:00 <DoT`> i found a few sites, but not this one :/   most are just youtubes, or screenshots in series
01:51:02 <Camail> also making your own smokes is a thing
01:51:10 <Camail> its pretty easy, it fials most of the time but its easy
01:51:11 <DoT`> its missing some like smoking crossover at A long
01:51:31 <Camail> find a corner, pick random visual queues to point your crosshair at, then see where the smoke goes
01:51:36 <DoT`> which i thought was an important one
01:52:02 <Camail> it is, most people wing that one
01:52:07 <Camail> but there is a good set up
01:52:14 <DoT`> the red sign
01:52:32 <Camail> yea but there is a bit of a subtlety 
01:52:35 -!- BioPhone [~Bioandroi@166.175.191.230] has joined #tlponies
01:52:45 <DoT`> i can do that one fine
01:52:50 <Camail> because its a running smoke where people will be moving
01:52:51 <DoT`> most of the time
01:53:22 <Camail> so if you do the one where you ahve to run like 2 meters then you are 100% gonna bump into someone in game and fuck up ur smoke
01:54:10 <Camail> if you look a little bit above the sign then the smoke goes farther and you have to run less
01:54:14 <DoT`> well i suppose i havnt had to do in that situation
01:54:25 <Camail> its something you realize in game
01:54:35 <Camail> I've had my cross smoke fucked up a ton of times like that
01:54:37 <Camail> before i switched
01:54:44 <Camail> but i havent really played d2 since i relearned it
01:54:53 <BioPhone> Are dot being of shoots?
01:54:59 <DoT`> not right now
01:55:09 <Camail> the 3 maps you sohuld elarn smokes for first are d2, cache, and inferno
01:55:18 <Camail> mirage a site smokes are really important too
01:55:28 <Camail> but mirage is less popular
01:56:23 <BioPhone> Mirage is so hit or miss for me
01:56:30 <DoT`> i did learn some inferno smokes/flashs, but lack of use means i cant recall them
01:59:05 <DuB`> Kela tank micro! 
01:59:13 <DuB`> (Haha, "tank micro" is a thing.)
02:02:38 <Camail> mirage is a pretty fun map, mid is really important because it enables fast rotates and site flanking for the entire map

02:09:45 <skram> dont think thats true cam

02:13:25 <DoT`> d'aaww
02:13:56 <Camail> i  cant really say anything about popularity in eu MMs
02:14:19 <Camail> though i know in high level play cache has become extremely popular
02:16:19 <Camail> though i suppose mirage might be more popular in na than i let on
02:16:31 <Camail> the real point I'm making is that you don't want to play mirage in MM
02:16:40 <Camail> its a horrible map to play without a stack
02:17:04 <Camail> because its a flip of the coin on which team decides to get space control
02:17:04 <skram> well obviously
02:17:46 <skram> cache is a terrible terrible map to in a solo q too, since its usually very reactive and strats tend to be more volatile in my experience
02:18:00 <Camail> ehhhhh
02:18:03 <skram> having rotates and getting info with randoms is mostly impossible
02:18:18 <Camail> its easier to take mid solo on cache
02:18:35 <Camail> like, 2-1-2 is viable in cache with all the site ppl looking at the t side
02:18:44 <Camail> in mirage even the people on site need toa ccount for mid
02:18:50 <Camail> which is one step MM palyers cant handle
02:19:14 <Rawr|Fone> Piggelindrink ❤❤❤
02:19:15 <Camail> and if you manage tog et a team to do 2-2-1 with a mid guy in vents
02:19:23 <skram> true, without mid control, or at least control over cat/window/connector you get easily shut down on A
02:19:24 <Camail> on ct side thats just individually strong
02:20:02 <skram> whenever we stack we usually run 1-2-2 with one on speedway on rotate
02:20:29 <Camail> I prefer 1-3-1 
02:20:38 <Camail> but you can never get MM to play that right
02:20:42 <Camail> so i never even ask
02:21:12 <skram> meh thats pretty dangerous unless you get one in vents quickly
02:21:20 <Camail> which isnt hard
02:21:28 <Camail> first out mid sohuld always smoke
02:21:39 <Camail> which 90% of the time blooms before they can even get there
02:22:01 -!- Biopone [~Bioandroi@166.175.191.230] has joined #tlponies
02:22:24 <Camail> i usually smoke mid, molly boost, then moonwalk to vents
02:22:34 <Camail> even if we're only playing 2 mid
02:23:04 <skram> as a b player?
02:23:09 <Camail> and no one in MM is gonna ahve the teamwork to put someone in sun room then molly vents
02:23:21 <Camail> hmm?
02:23:26 <Camail> mid player going vents
02:23:36 <Camail> the vents guy covers checkers
02:23:43 <Camail> he's like half a b player
02:23:54 <skram> well then youre mostly fucked if theres a 5man a hit
02:24:02 <Camail> no?
02:24:05 <Camail> retreat mid
02:24:16 <Camail> you also get to hear every footstep on T side
02:24:46 <Camail> and with 1-3-1 you should be keeping mid smoked a vast majority of the time
02:25:05 <Camail> vents has angles on boost, garage, and checkkers
02:25:42 <Camail> also the classic lob a lash at the checkers vent grate to make a noise then pop flash anyone looking
02:25:49 <Camail> as you hop a long into checkers
02:26:12 <skram> well ok its fine if you do 1-3-1 with one person on speedway
02:26:35 <Camail> anything x-2-x
02:26:49 <skram> for a fast a hit you probably wont have time to retreat from vent to site before ts have control
02:26:57 <Camail> you can also have the b guy pop flash b main if you need to escape to checkers
02:27:12 <Camail> well it depends on what the hit is
02:27:57 <Camail> but in most cases i dont believe thats true, it takes around 1 second to drop to checkers
02:28:08 <Camail> and no one is gonna 5 man hit a site without any nades
02:28:24 <CockRoach|42> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaH4CAxfXwU
02:28:34 <Camail> unless they are already peeking you from checkers you have time to do anything
02:28:46 <Camail> I'vve played that spot so many times
02:28:52 <skram> im not talking about b
02:29:01 <Camail> oh, a?
02:29:03 <skram> ya
02:29:11 <Camail> its no worse than having 2 at b
02:29:17 <Camail> its an even faster flank rotate, actually
02:29:23 <DoT`> DUB
02:29:26 <DoT`> its THE BUILD
02:30:26 <DoT`> haha
02:30:31 <DoT`> Zk, you see this?
02:30:38 <skram> dunno we always seem to get fucked fairly easy against a rush without someone on close rotate
02:30:42 <zkay> what?
02:30:45 <zkay> whats goin on?
02:30:56 <DoT`> fast overlord speed drop
02:30:56 <Camail> well if you have 1-3-1 then you'll have one white box and one Z
02:31:06 <Camail> Z goes truck, whitebox goes toxic
02:31:14 <zkay> were there any banes?
02:31:18 <skram> well yeah
02:31:20 <Camail> if they smoke truck/forklift, the toxic guy can move to site
02:31:29 <DoT`> nope, not yet
02:31:32 <zkay> queens... thats smart
02:31:33 <DoT`> it needs banes
02:31:34 <zkay> ill have to use those
02:31:43 <zkay> but yea the whole drop is about banes!
02:31:44 <Camail> vents guy can flank, or z guy can rush up to counter boost him
02:31:58 <Camail> b guy govers for the lurker as he slow rotates
02:32:09 <Camail> seems like a pretty simple rotate up to the bomb
02:32:35 -!- Biopone [~Bioandroi@166.175.191.230] has joined #tlponies
02:32:43 <Camail> the site guy still needs to kill someone
02:33:35 <Camail> that seems like mre of a problem with the a anchor than the rotate
02:33:44 <Camail> he should be counter flashing immediately
02:35:25 <DoT`> the drop!
02:35:26 <zkay> omg kelazhur
02:35:29 <zkay> you supposed to notice that
02:35:37 <Camail> also a good trick to do with 1-3-1 is have the whitebox guy play a for the first 15-20 seconds ,maybe get flashed into a main to check for info

22:18:53 <DuB`> If someone asks "Did you go to the party yesterday?"
