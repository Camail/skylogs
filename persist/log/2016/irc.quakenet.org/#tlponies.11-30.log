21:19:49 <carcinisation> it's like time pressure makes blunders happen
21:20:11 <Dot`> who would have thought
21:20:21 <Halvgud> "Only Human"
21:20:48 <Dot`> no human gets GM at 12 halv!
21:20:58 <motbob> just exchange the humans with computers
21:21:02 <carcinisation> h5!
21:21:22 <motbob> the tiebreaker can be who used less computer power
21:21:31 <motbob> also we can have the matches in 5 minutes eah

21:23:28 <Dot`> chess good sport
21:23:36 <Halvgud> Norway readies the lutefisk nukes against Russia
21:23:51 <carcinisation> armageddon excited
21:23:54 <Halvgud> Codmaggedon soon!
21:24:35 <motbob> the closest esports equivalent to this I can think of was when we had that proleague format with the Bo2 playoff finals and the Super Ace match (which sadly we never got to see)
21:24:58 <motbob> this is an all-day Super Ace match
21:35:30 <motbob> Now there's a 0.15% chance of armageddon
21:37:50 <skram> i am sorry Halvgud but lutefisk is gross
21:39:59 <motbob> truth
21:40:30 <motbob> actually I only have second-hand information about that. Someone at my law firm was talking about how gross it is.
21:41:48 <skram> dont you live in minnesota? i bet you could go to a resturant and get some
21:43:31 <motbob> ya
21:43:39 <motbob> but I will decline
21:44:46 <skram> so picky
21:44:52 <skram> wont even eat jellyfied fish
21:45:04 <motbob> people say that lutefisk is in the bottom 1% of foods
21:47:21 <Rawr|Fone> It's worse
21:48:46 <skram> you take a piece of dried fish, soak it in water for a bit, then put it in lye and water for a few days, and then you put it in some more water, and then you eat it
21:48:52 <skram> thats not how you make tasty food
21:52:14 <Halvgud> @skram and why do you think we use this as our nuclear deterrent? It can't really compare with the Swedish Surströmming Savage C4 tho..
21:52:35 <skram> oh yeah thats on a different scale of awful
21:52:56 <Halvgud> An order of magnitude awful
21:53:15 <skram> some people i know tried it and made a video
21:53:34 <skram> its just a bunch of dudes laying down on a lawn and throwing up for 7 minutes
21:53:43 <Halvgud> You haven't really lived until you've tasted moonshine made from lutefisk
21:54:06 <skram> we just use potatoes where i live
21:54:09 <skram> like civilized people
21:54:22 <Halvgud> *barbaric
21:54:23 <motbob> civilized and uncivilized alike
21:54:42 <skram> i live a long way from the ocean halv
21:54:58 <motbob> we just use corn where I live(d)
21:55:03 <Halvgud> you niding
21:55:21 <Halvgud> where is your inner pillager?
21:55:24 <skram> >:(
21:55:28 <Halvgud> go forth and swim!
21:55:32 <motbob> the fact that you can use corn and potatoes to make alcohol makes the prospect of abolition laughable
