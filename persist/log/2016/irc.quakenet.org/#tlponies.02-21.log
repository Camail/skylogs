00:11:51 <Yolteotl> "The official start day for "Spring" which was the original timeframe for season 6 is March 20, but I think we should lean toward Hasbro's Toy Fair presentation for the actual date over Zap2it this time."

00:37:19 <Dot_> you had a sliver to see they guy move from b to a
00:37:48 <Dot_> how you knew he wouldnt go around, not sure, maybe timing
00:37:53 <Camail> I was also on the rails
00:38:04 <Dot_> headshot ws an odd angle for him
00:38:04 <Bio> if he went around, he'd have like no time to diffuse
00:38:06 <Dot_> hight
00:38:06 <Camail> I played a weird spot to catch him off guard
00:38:24 <Camail> I fought him from the back of b, he wouldn't wrap
00:38:32 <Camail> unless he wanted to go somwhere close to where i would be
00:38:51 <Camail> also i heard his footsteps 6-7 seconds before he ppeeked

01:13:48 <Dot_> skram, !
01:23:36 <Dot_> cane, would you recomend Blacklist then?
01:25:38 <Cane> Dot_, I just binged the whole show (3 seasons I think), so it would be fairly disingenuous of me to say no. I like it just fine, but it hasn't quite lived up to the fairly excellent pilot episode. It's the TV equivalent of a page turner. Keeps being fun but doesn't stick with you at all.
01:25:45 <Dot_> cam why do ppl do that shake in cs? does it mess with hitboxs?
01:26:10 <Dot_> so sometihng to watch on the side while doing other things then
01:26:31 <Cane> I'm looking up Homeland right now. Anyone seen it?
01:26:59 <CockRoach|42> co-workers have recommended it
01:27:00 <Dot_> you seen house of cards cane?
01:28:03 <Cane> No, but obviously heard of it.
01:28:24 <Camail> Dot_  what do you mean, shake
01:28:28 <Camail> like, when they are peeking?
01:28:33 <Camail> or holding an angle
01:28:35 <Dot_> no
01:28:39 <Dot_> when they get shot at
01:28:47 <Camail> no they just suck
01:29:44 <Camail> it depends on the gun
01:29:49 <Camail> but no you should never shake
01:29:51 <Bio> bek
01:29:58 <Camail> because that means you are ADADing way too fast
01:30:06 <Camail> and you arent actually moving very much
01:30:12 <Dot_> no i mean the mouse shaking
01:30:15 <Camail> ?
01:30:29 <Camail> shitty strafe jump maybe
01:30:32 <Camail> those guys all sucked tho
01:30:33 <Dot_> whewre they look all over quickly while for instance jumping to cover
01:30:50 <Camail> is it erratic?
01:30:54 <Dot_> yes
01:31:03 <Camail> they think they're doing something but they arent
01:31:12 <Camail> its an attempt at strafe jumping
01:31:21 <Camail> something you can look up or I'll tell you about later
01:32:35 <carcinisation> final table get
01:37:31 <Dot_> hmm, i cant find a good way to describe it cam
01:39:45 <Crisium> Cane I've seen Homeland
01:40:35 <carcinisation> and aj busts me in both tourneys D:
01:40:40 <Dot_> :/
01:41:23 <Crisium> House of Cards is better than Homeland fwiw
01:41:52 <Dot_> fwiw?
01:42:06 <Dot_> im too old for all these abreviations
01:42:09 <carcinisation> for what it's worth
01:42:14 <Crisium> yes
01:42:34 <Crisium> i feel like homeland is a show that shouldn't have as many seasons as it has
01:42:50 <Crisium> it had a purpose, but then they just kept going
01:42:55 <Rawr|Fone> .tell bio http://imgur.com/gallery/NXZTs1E
01:42:58 <Dot_> thats a shame
01:43:05 <Cane> Crisium, I looked at the premise, and then thought, how can they have THIS MANY SEASONS dedicated to this setup?
01:43:15 <Rawr|Fone> Cane http://imgur.com/gallery/NXZTs1E
01:43:20 <Crisium> they solve it, and then just make new storylines every episode Cane
01:43:23 <Cane> Well, that's goddamned adorable.
01:43:24 <Crisium> er every season*
01:43:28 <Cane> Crisium, oh, of course.
01:43:32 <Dot_> thats cute rawr
01:43:59 <Rawr|Fone> Very cute
01:44:02 <Crisium> i would recommend you watch it, but just be open to stopping if you dont like each season premiere or whjatever
01:45:24 <Dot_> I can recomend Black Books if you somehow havnt seen it
01:48:02 <Crisium> Dot_ since you are UK have you seen Peep Show?
01:48:14 <Dot_> never heard of it
01:48:18 <Crisium> my favourite british comedy
01:48:25 <Crisium> it was on netflix last i checked
01:48:41 <Dot_> Over the garden wall cane, its a ncie cartoon
01:49:15 <Rawr|Fone> Black books
01:49:19 <Rawr|Fone> Is amazing
01:49:39 <Dot_> Thats why it would be weird if he hasnt seen it rawr
01:49:55 <Dot_> cane being a well educated norwegion

01:54:20 <Rawr|Fone> D:
01:54:31 <Dot_> Crisium, have you not seen black books?
01:54:32 <CockRoach|42> it is literally impossible to draw things
01:54:40 <Crisium> nay
01:54:40 <Dot_> i drew a box cr
01:54:50 <CockRoach|42> woho :)
01:54:51 <DuB`> Ponies are easy.
01:54:51 <Dot_> and scribbles on one side of it
01:55:00 <DuB`> Just draw frekponies.
01:55:02 <Dot_> go now Crisium 
01:55:22 <Dot_> it owuld be an afront to attempt such a thing dub
01:55:43 <DuB`> Hmmm.
01:55:54 <DuB`> Well as long as it has cyan and pink it should turn out pretty, so no prob.

02:22:22 <Crisium> but do one of those things
02:22:36 <Micen> I think i am forced onto that second track Crispon
02:22:36 <Dot_> be like rawr micen and drink 
02:22:55 <Micen> I have no alchohol. my brother spoiled the rest of my gin on accident
02:23:40 <Dot_> i use to go to sleep wacthing MASH for about a year
02:24:02 <Micen> he knocked over a floorlamp. one of those ones that has the half dome lampshade pointed at the ceiling. it had dead bugs in it and they went into my gin. :(
02:24:09 <Dot_> i still moslty go to sleep listenign to something, and background noise doesnt help
02:24:20 <Dot_> sucks micen
02:24:29 <Micen> I cant sleep to TV or movies. I get too drawn in to them
02:24:36 <Micen> even if they are complete and utter crap
02:24:43 <Dot_> thats why i used MASH, i knew it all
02:24:52 <Dot_> and it was funny
02:26:02 <Micen> its worse with shows i know 
02:26:17 <Micen> like How I Met Your Mother. I could watch that over and over and never be sick of it
02:27:57 <Dot_> MASH is about the only thing I have rewatched
