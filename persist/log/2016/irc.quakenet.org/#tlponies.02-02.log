00:11:40 <DoT`> oi you
00:14:11 <DoT`> where dub rawr
00:16:30 <Rawr|Phone> Probably ded
00:17:33 <DoT`> :(
00:21:21 <Rawr|Phone> It's pretty sad dot
00:21:35 <DoT`> whats the plan rawr
00:22:28 <skram> thats a private matter dot
00:23:08 <DoT`> is it now skram
00:23:46 <skram> yes dot
00:24:16 <DoT`> seems rude to me
00:25:14 <DoT`> cam, i did shoot today, and spent some time learning smokes/flashs
00:26:06 <skram> are you global yet
00:27:59 <DoT`> in my heart
00:28:06 <skram> thats what matters
00:28:18 <Rawr|Phone> Definitely
00:29:42 <DoT`> you are too skram
00:29:53 <skram> absolutely not :p
00:35:36 <DoT`> please skram, you need faith
00:41:55 <DoT`> what yoyu up to skram?
00:42:23 <skram> im watching critical role and looking at pictures of cats
00:42:39 <DoT`> oh ya, i still have to watch that at some point
00:42:55 <skram> its like 150 hours worth of stuff now
00:43:04 <DoT`> i am rather behind
00:43:11 <skram> its pretty good
00:51:15 <DoT`> .roll d20 to art maybe
00:55:11 <Rawr|Phone> Draw a majestic moose dot
00:57:06 <DoT`> skram said the same yesterday
00:57:17 <DoT`> but mees are tricky
01:10:12 <Camail> I'm torn on critical roll
01:10:16 <Camail> I really really like it
01:10:56 <Camail> but  sometimes they do stuff thats either uninteresting or painful to watch
01:11:25 <Camail> and marisha ray doesnt read her spells before using them
01:11:42 <Camail> which is annoying and actively harmful to the party
01:13:54 <skram> i agree with that honestly
01:14:15 <skram> marisha is kinda adorable sometimes and then she turns everyone into clouds and almost kills the entire party
01:14:40 <skram> also liam monolouges and RPs way way too hard sometimes

20:45:29 <DoT`> i dont get ppl
20:46:23 <DoT`> i have spent about 200 hours playing on SA NS2 servers, there is only about 8 of us regulers
20:46:37 <CockRoach|42> :o
20:46:38 <DoT`> and yet i still get conversations like i just had
20:47:25 <DoT`> i message one of them on steam asking if SA NS2 is using a discord or TS, as there wasnt much communicating happening during games
20:47:27 <DoT`> i get back
20:47:32 <DoT`> "we use a discord"
20:47:35 <DoT`> nothing more
20:47:45 <DoT`> no invote to it no nothing...
20:48:35 <DoT`> i dont know, i thought i was making an effort here to be nice and after roughly 200 hours i still seem to get a cold shoulder
20:49:53 <reification> i can’t be held responsible for SA ppl
20:50:15 <reification> maybe you should leave SA in protest :p

22:04:19 <BioSC> many much sad
22:06:22 <skram> get global and carry me DoT`
22:06:43 <DoT`> Skram, i cant risk cam being proud
22:07:27 <skram> I dnt think that would happen even if you placed first at DH with a team of 4 trained snakes
22:07:54 <DoT`> but skram, do i want to risl it D:
22:08:04 <skram> yolo
22:10:42 <reification> it could work skram
22:11:04 <reification> if the snakes are poisonous and trained to bite the other team
22:11:26 <skram> there might be something in the rules against that reif
22:11:59 <DoT`> find a rule that says no snakes 
22:12:40 <skram> I think its less about the snakes and more about physically assaulting competitors

23:57:40 <DoT`> when my headset died dubs i burrowed one
23:57:45 <DoT`> now that one is mine
23:58:18 <DuB`> Hah.
23:58:29 <DuB`> Well I guess this is an opportunity for an upgrade.
23:58:50 <DuB`> Since they no longer make that set and I doubt I'll find anything of its quality for the $70 I paid.
23:58:57 <DuB`> $$$$
23:59:16 <DuB`> I COULD get the same set if I pay >$300 on ebay.
