17:13:16 <Cane> You missed three snap shots.
17:13:23 <DoT`> you going to play thorugh all xcoms cane then try the new one?
17:13:29 <Cane> Then Reification took one from further away and gibbed the sucker.
17:13:30 <DoT`> warning shots!
17:13:53 <DoT`> i tried to warn them about reif, he is bloodthirsty
17:14:19 <Cane> I'm waiting for more soldiers right now, gotta figure out who to add.
17:14:28 <DoT`> you have a dub?
17:14:35 <DoT`> and a rawr
17:14:47 <DoT`> though rawr in my Dorf fort games always dies first
17:15:06 <Micen> I should be there. 
17:15:20 <Micen> death to the xeno scum
17:15:24 <Cane> I have Rawr, no Dub yet, that should be next.
17:15:31 <Cane> Micen volunteered, that's good.
17:15:48 <DoT`> micen crack suicide squad
17:16:09 <Micen> Thats me
17:16:23 <Rawr|Phone> That's your fault dot
17:16:27 <Micen> When i see battle. I run towards it. 
17:16:29 <Micen> then past it
17:16:36 <Micen> then as far away from it as i can get.
17:16:42 <DoT`> you are the hunter rawr, the only person in the party with fighting skills!
17:16:44 <CockRoach|42> :D
17:17:29 <Micen> This is strange having a second screen again after so long
17:17:58 <DoT`> micen are you Ciaphas Cain?
17:19:25 <CockRoach|42> sounds more like forrest gump
17:19:50 <Micen> You saying that because i technically live in the southern USA?
17:20:10 <DoT`> dub too is a southerner
17:21:32 <motbob> comparing hyper light drifter to dark souls is the dark souls of comparing dark souls to things
17:21:42 <Micen> "the south" in the USA is basicaly anything east of texas, and south of missouri
17:21:55 <DoT`> the ppl get awefully elitest about it?
17:22:06 <DoT`> :P
17:22:17 <Micen> i may have made a mistake
17:22:26 <Micen> I just got 3 months of wow for free.

17:27:13 <reification> maybe he wanted to find his next game as he enjoyed dark souls so much

17:28:26 <DoT`> im onyl 3 levels behind you then cam
17:28:58 <Camail> i didnt play that much, tbh
17:31:18 <DoT|Phone> I blame dub
17:40:25 <motbob> all of the weather wwarning sirens in the county went off at 6:10AM due to a malfunction
17:40:46 <motbob> i chekced to see if there was a nuclear launch and then went back to bed
17:41:05 <motbob> probably i would have gone back to bed even if there had been a launch
17:41:09 <Pearlock> Good to be sure
17:43:24 <Cane> Alright, I got my new crew. Time to name those fuckers.

18:46:59 <Cane> I mean rookie. Rookie.
18:47:01 <DoT|Phone> cane. what's the point in saving the planet if the
18:47:13 <DoT|Phone> eco system dies
18:47:42 <Cane> Phearlock managed to snipe his way to Sergeant, Camail pulls even further away from the rest of you slowpokes by being my first Captain.
18:48:32 <CockRoach|42> pons pls
18:48:43 <Camail> art mimics life
18:48:46 <CockRoach|42> assign me, and i'll show you how it's done
18:49:00 <Cane> I should rotate my crew around so skram and CockRoach can actually get out of my Skyranger before the battle is over.
18:49:18 <CockRoach|42> :D
18:51:14 <Cane> Gotta give them a chance to miss, at least.
18:52:16 <Cane> Oh crapbaskets. That UFO almost killed my Interceptor.
18:52:27 <Cane> My fault for making Phearlock a sniper instead of a pilot.
18:52:38 <Cane> Accuracy was too good to pass up.
18:54:19 <Cane> Alright CR, show me what you're made of.
18:54:33 <Cane> ...

19:02:43 <Micen> wow dot
19:02:53 <Micen> didnt even tell me there was an NC stream. 
19:02:58 <Micen> SHAME
19:03:27 <motbob> i think signing up to die for your country is all well and good until you actually die
19:05:30 <Pearlock> Am I dead yet Cane?
19:06:16 <CockRoach|42> motbob is the real mvp, taking bullets
19:06:35 <Pearlock> He'd be even more MVP if he survived said bullets
19:09:13 <Camail> they cant all be as good as us phear
19:09:55 <Pearlock> I read upwards and apparently I'm not dead
19:09:56 <Pearlock> amaze
19:10:12 <motbob> whatever
19:10:43 <DuB`> I'm either still alive or died so insignificantly that it didn't even warrent comment.
19:10:44 <DuB`> Hm.
19:10:54 <motbob> irl i've never died from a bullet and i think that's what matters
19:10:59 <DuB`> warrant*
19:11:14 <Pearlock> A good statistic to keep
19:12:29 <DoT`> and you have never had cane as your commander
19:12:42 <DuB`> Life-stats would be the coolest thing.
19:12:48 <DuB`> I would want to know all sorts of random stuff.
19:13:05 <DuB`> Like, home many sandwiches have I eaten in my life, and what percentage of them included peanut butter?

19:18:09 <Bio> he's the lunchroom guy
19:20:50 <Cane> notbob arrived and he has a whopping 80 throwing accuracy.
19:20:57 <Cane> Crew, meet your new grenadier.
19:21:15 <Bio> dam son
19:21:18 <Pearlock> hurray xD
19:21:33 <Pearlock> notbob could have made it big in handegg
19:21:34 <Cane> Firing accuracy of 42 means I'll give him a gun only if I ever need an "accident" so I can replace you fuckers.
19:21:39 <Pearlock> but he decided to go fight aliens
19:23:12 <Cane> Holy shit notbob, max carry weight of 20 pounds?!
19:23:19 <Cane> Yeah, pistol and grenades for you.
19:23:19 <motbob> accurate
19:24:08 <DuB`> I assume that's low? :P
19:24:16 <Camail> can YOU lift 20 pounds
19:24:21 <DuB`> Hahaha
19:24:46 <Pearlock> Spread it out across back, hands, belt, yeah 20 pounds seems pretty doable.
19:24:55 <Camail> dub is the next class your last
19:25:00 <DuB`> Yeah.
19:25:08 <Cane> Camail can lift 46 pounds.
19:25:18 <DoT`> Beast
19:25:21 <Camail> i am ubermench 
19:25:26 <Cane> So yeah, notbob is a pussy.
19:25:31 <DoT`> well he needs to be able to lift a lot
19:25:35 <Cane> I was gonna have him carry extra nades and ammo for everyone else.
19:25:38 <DoT`> ponies are heavy to carry
19:25:45 <Cane> He's not fit to carry everyone else's lunch box.
19:25:51 <Cane> He can pack, like, one.
19:25:54 <Cane> But he can throw it super good.
19:26:08 <DoT`> haha, thorwing lunch boxes at aliens
19:26:26 <DuB`> Maybe he can transition to throwing nearby stones at aliens after he's used up his small inventory of grenades.
19:26:30 <DuB`> Hobbit-style.
19:26:47 <DuB`> "notbob, use your GUN"
19:26:54 <DuB`> "But guys, THROWING!!"
19:27:08 <Camail> throw the gun?
19:27:22 <DoT`> throw the bullets!
19:27:24 <Pearlock> Yeah you can throw weapons in xcom 1
19:27:25 <Cane> I think I'll just give notbob some bullets.
19:27:32 <Cane> Fucker can throw those.
19:27:51 <Cane> He understands bullets, just not the concept of bullets coming out of a weapon.
19:27:52 <Pearlock> He can stand by the skyranger and be a mobile equipment dispenser
19:28:21 <Cane> Yeah, for real though I'll just leave him by the skyranger, he can throw extra equipment to the troopers.
19:29:16 <Pearlock> In finalmodpack you could throw equipment to the attack dogs and have them use it.
19:29:41 <Pearlock> They only have a carry weight of 2, but as long as they drop the gear at the end of their turn or don't move, they're fine.

19:35:09 <Cane> Stop being so good.
19:35:27 <Pearlock> If only I was that good at shooting games
19:36:46 <Cane> You just stepped onto the skyranger's ramp in the middle of the smoke grenade, raised your giant cannon nonchalantly, and blew that thing's head off from three screens away.

19:44:11 <Rawr|Phone> !
19:45:37 <Micen> How am I doing Cane?
19:47:53 <Cane> You were promoted to Squaddie right away. You have really high movement points so I use you as a scout.
19:47:58 <Cane> You tend to see a lot of action.
19:49:12 <Cane> Since Bio likes to make me a giant space viking MEC, I gave him a rocket launcher and stuffed him full of nades.
19:49:13 <carcinisation2> am i ded yet?

20:11:20 <Camail> THAT'S WHY I CHEAT
20:11:32 <Camail> I need to find love somewhere else
20:11:55 <Camail> in moxxie's loving embrace
20:12:04 <Camail> and hot XP dumps

20:13:16 <DoT`> you should level a bit skram
20:13:18 <Camail> also
20:13:20 <DoT`> you are behind
20:13:23 <Camail> tediore rocket launchers are the best
20:13:29 <Camail> you effectively get twice as much ammo
20:13:37 <Cane> Wow, good job skram. You found two sectoids in the smoke grenade and gatling'd them both down.
20:13:40 <skram> well you see i thought we were gonna play together DoT`
20:13:45 <Camail> and they reload so quickly the dps is the best of any rocket
20:13:54 <Camail> lmao skram pls
20:13:57 <skram> i have been practicing cane
20:14:08 <skram> well fuck i have no desire to play solo
20:14:10 <DoT`> well 3 of us are skram
20:14:16 <Cane> Dot got a kill! o/
20:14:24 <DoT`> someone has no self control 
20:14:27 <DoT`> yay cane!
20:14:33 <skram> play without me then
20:14:39 <DoT`> had to happen eventualy, even just by tripping over my gun
20:15:00 <DoT`> why skram? becasue cam is playing solo?
20:15:09 <DoT`> that still leaves me and dub
20:15:42 <Camail> no one is being forced to play solo
20:15:56 <Camail> dot and dub are stillth e same level
20:16:17 <Camail> there's clearly a misunderstanding
20:16:18 <DoT`> cam is just going to soon reach a level where he cant join us
20:16:20 <DoT`> then be sad
20:16:31 <Camail> not really
20:16:40 <Camail> I've ran out of sidequests that are near my level
20:16:56 <Camail> I just like shooting things
20:17:10 <DoT`> maybe play a seprate character solo?
20:17:19 <Camail> my weapons aren't even high leveled
20:17:24 <Camail> they're all lvl 20
20:18:35 <Camail> there's literally no need to compromise, what we're doing now works
20:18:40 <Camail> because it worked well last session
20:18:46 <Camail> considering no one noticed
20:19:20 <DoT`> well 5 levels you are now ahead is a mcuh larger diffrence than the 4 from ealier levels
20:19:29 <Camail> I disagree
20:19:41 <Camail> and the way levels are given you very quickly level it out
20:20:03 <Camail> you get much more xp thna i do if the party host is the same level as you

20:20:36 <Camail> getting a better weapon matters more than gaining one level, its the equivalent of finding a purple for your main gun
20:20:50 <Camail> all of a sudden you're stronger than everyone else for a few hours
20:20:58 <Camail> but in this its only like 30 minutes at most?
20:21:11 <Camail> and I'm a sniper, who deals with 1v1 high damage output to beign with
20:21:47 <Camail> but with no input from skram at all its hard to gauge the point of the conversation at all
20:22:15 <Camail> as long as i dont host the game there is effectively no difference
20:22:30 <skram> well alright then
20:22:39 <skram> plej when dub comes home?
20:22:43 <Camail> ya
20:26:43 <DoT`> only many hours to go
20:33:42 <DoT`> dub should have skipped class
20:51:28 <Cane> Holy crap, CockRoach|42 took a plasma rifle shot in the nuts and still killed his attacker.
20:52:48 <CockRoach|42> like a cockroach
20:52:49 <CockRoach|42> :)
21:05:26 <Camail> no children to tell that tale to, tho
21:06:10 <DoT`> now just roach
21:07:34 <DuB`> HOME!
21:07:42 <DuB`> Reeeeeeeeaaaaally good thing I went, dot. O_o
21:07:49 <DoT`> haha
21:07:52 <DoT`> game time?
21:08:06 <DuB`> He had us put away all of our notes and phones and stuff.
21:08:32 <DuB`> And then showed a bunch of example problems to show us the sort of thing we need to prepare for the final.
21:08:55 <DuB`> At the end he told us that they actually WERE the final, and that we've now seen the entire thing.
21:09:27 <DuB`> To get our confidence up and show us that we really do know the stuff and can handle it, because it's a way stressful class.
21:09:35 <DuB`> So.
21:09:38 <DuB`> Yeah, gametiem!
21:09:49 <DoT`> easy life
