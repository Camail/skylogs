01:08:08 <DoT|Phone> it going well dub
01:08:10 <DoT|Phone> ?
01:08:14 <DuB`> Yah.
01:08:20 <DuB`> On "easy". :P
01:08:48 <DoT|Phone> haha
01:09:06 <DuB`> I technically finished my first campaign, became shogun!
01:09:26 <DoT|Phone> I probably can't recall the factions. but which on you playing as
01:09:31 <DuB`> Hojo
01:09:40 <DoT|Phone> I liked the ones with special monks
01:09:55 <DuB`> By the time you get that far just managing happiness and fighting like 10 people at once gets annoying.
01:10:16 <DuB`> I want to use armies to fight, not sit in cities to prevent revolt!
01:10:34 <DoT|Phone> eventually all battles become auto because laziness :p
01:11:55 <DuB`> I WOULD go take over the southern half of the country, but I have to just sit and manage happiness instead!
01:13:14 <DoT|Phone> haha. You need to research the anti corruption and things
01:13:39 <DoT|Phone> and capture less quickly. civil unrest from conversion
01:14:40 <DuB`> I had two neighbors on my left who I was super friendly with the entire game, and used them as a buffer while I focused on taking the entire northern half.
01:15:19 <DuB`> But then they suddenly got wrecked and lost everything in like 2-3 turns, and my daimyo's son had to stage a heroic clutch defense of my southern cities.
01:15:34 <DuB`> His first battles -trial by fire.
01:16:00 <DuB`> Fun storylines.
01:16:34 <DoT|Phone> Nice!
01:16:41 <DoT|Phone> on hard no one likes you
