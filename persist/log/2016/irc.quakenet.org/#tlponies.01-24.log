03:08:06 <Crisium> :O
03:08:07 <Phearlock> The fic is about 50k to 80k words from me being done reading it. Which I can manage in a few hours.
03:08:18 <Crisium> a few hours tomorrw maybe?
03:08:20 <Crisium> lol
03:08:23 <Phearlock> I'm in a super exciting part

03:08:49 <Phearlock> Where I can properly stop
03:10:17 <Phearlock> But no, can't stop now!
03:10:27 <Phearlock> Hoping it'll calm down a bit after the next chapter
03:20:04 <Phearlock> This fic is making such good use of the concept of hypersonic projectiles from high powered telekinesis.

03:52:08 <DuB`> As in "jw".

03:52:46 <DuB`> i think I would be better at juri if that were the case.
03:52:49 <DuB`> Just a little.

03:59:09 <skram> :----D
03:59:14 <DuB`> xD
03:59:16 <DuB`> Haaaaahaha.
03:59:47 <DuB`> I just learned that earning a conquest in HC doesn't also give you the SC version.
03:59:55 <DuB`> Someone had told me that it does. >:T
04:00:05 <Crisium> what is hc
04:00:14 <skram> hardcore
04:00:20 <Crisium> is game?

04:00:27 <skram> it makes you die forever
04:00:30 <skram> yes
04:00:40 <Crisium> ah, i hear that game is making a comeback
04:00:44 <Crisium> is HC a new mode?
04:01:08 <skram> Nah HC has been around since d1 I think but there are seasons
04:01:22 <skram> soo you start at nothing in a new season and for some reason that makes it funner
04:02:26 <DuB> It makes no sense.
04:02:29 <DuB> But it's true.

04:40:51 <Phearlock> Ok phew I found a point I feel I can stop at.
04:41:09 <skram> but what if something super neat happens next chapter
04:41:17 <Phearlock> Then I will read it then
04:41:43 <skram> weak
04:41:56 <Phearlock> Next chapter probably has some thermobaric demolition charges involved.
04:42:03 <Phearlock> which will be pretty neat
04:43:25 <Crisium> Phearlock is this your fic http://royalsketchbook.tumblr.com/post/137717899789/twilight-and-no-i-cant-see-any-good-coming
04:44:19 <Phearlock> I don't think twilight would write about this sort of thing happening.
04:44:25 <Phearlock> Fic is pretttyyyyyyyy dark at times.
04:45:23 <Phearlock> But also awesome
04:45:52 <Phearlock> Probably does the best job of magic/phyiscs interaction I've read so far.
04:52:53 <DuB`> No dark pls.
04:52:57 <DuB`> Pons are happyfriends.
04:53:28 <Phearlock> Pons are happyfriends
04:53:49 <Phearlock> However pons aren't really in a position where happy things happen.
04:54:04 <DuB`> But pons are in equestria!
04:54:08 <DuB`> And equestria is happy, too.
04:54:09 <Phearlock> Doesn't exist
04:54:14 <Phearlock> Super prequel story

11:12:46 <Micen> its on at GSL time
11:13:15 <Yolteotl_> yes, and gsl time is globally pretty bad, but it takes place in Korea
11:13:16 <DoT`> yolt complains about every finals :P
11:13:28 <Yolteotl_> so it has a reason to be bad
11:13:31 <Micen> Yolt, what time is it for you?
11:13:31 <DoT`> yes it would be better, but its still great
11:13:31 <Yolteotl_> here...
11:13:34 <CockRoach|42> yolt is such a happy person

11:46:39 <Yolteotl_> So, WCS 2016 gives us a one sided zerg who never won anything against a RO32 WCS2015 protoss in final stage, "thanks Blizzard" I suppose :P
11:50:50 <DoT`> yolt just enjoy sc2 for once :/
11:51:04 <DoT`> dont find the most negative comment on reddit
11:51:18 <Yolteotl_> (it's my comment on reddit ahaha)
11:52:00 <DoT`> thats worse :/
11:52:14 <Yolteotl_> but Dot. It was not enjoyable, I mean, sometimes, finals are bad, it happened a lot in SC2, and this one was not really good. It was one sided, and both players were not good
11:53:38 <Yolteotl_> But it won't stop me to play the whole afternoon to this game I like. 
11:54:54 <DoT`> but the finals where not bad
11:55:04 <DoT`> and you said the same about every finals you have watched
11:55:27 <Yolteotl_> nop
11:55:38 <Yolteotl_> NW3 final was awesome for example
11:56:06 <Yolteotl_> even more because a foreigner beated some of the best players in the world :)

18:11:34 <Yolteotl_> warcraft movie ?
18:11:40 <DoT`> ya
18:11:45 <Yolteotl_> it will be ok
18:11:51 <Yolteotl_> it's Warcraft 1
18:11:53 <Yolteotl_> with some changes
18:11:59 <Yolteotl_> (like flying dalaran)
18:12:10 <Yolteotl_> but nothing too problematic
18:12:53 <DoT`> well i know not much about warcraft lore, so i was just curiouus because i hear warcraft lore is getting jumbled at this point
18:13:47 <Yolteotl_> ppl saying that are just silly
18:13:59 <Yolteotl_> I mean, Blizzard changed the lore already 10 times

18:14:25 <DoT`> i dont know yolt
18:14:40 <Yolteotl_> the movie changes some stuff but nothing as huge as "hey, in fact, drenai are not dead"

21:21:23 <DoT|Phone> bio pon
21:22:19 <Phearlaptop> Bloody trying to convince me Auroth is a better waifu than Twilight.
21:22:21 <Phearlaptop> Please.
21:22:32 <Bio> that horse is still arouhnd?
21:22:34 <Phearlaptop> Twilight is best waifu
21:22:47 <Phearlaptop> Yeah he's still around.
21:22:54 <Bio> what a horse
21:23:00 <Bio> a wrong horse, but a horse
21:23:12 <Phearlaptop> He's more into dragons now.
21:24:17 <Phearlaptop> What a pony. http://pre14.deviantart.net/86ea/th/pre/i/2016/023/7/9/dawn_of_the_sun_by_silfoe-d9p3otp.jpg what a pony What a pony.
21:24:18 <Bio> sounds about right
21:24:24 <Phearlaptop> I like this pony
21:24:25 <Bio> he was big on the jakiro
21:24:39 <Phearlaptop> Oh and I found a mass effect fanfic
21:24:40 <Bio> =O
21:24:49 <Bio> i feel like her poor leg is bork
21:25:19 <Phearlaptop> Hmm, no I think it's ok
21:25:31 <Phearlaptop> Horse legs can sorta do that.
21:26:14 <Phearlaptop> http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/kneeling-horse-847411.jpg
21:26:17 <Phearlaptop> literal horse
21:26:36 <Phearlaptop> Shitty pic but first one google gave me
21:27:18 <Bio> idk, it doesn't seem right to me. but then again, MARSHMALLO HORSES
21:27:37 <Phearlaptop> I think it's the thickness of magic horse legs that makes it a bit weird.
21:27:55 <Phearlaptop> Compared to spindly normal horse legs
21:29:18 <DoT|Phone> those equine legs look ok to me
21:29:25 <Phearlaptop> ^
21:29:37 <Phearlaptop> Dot is horse person
21:29:41 <Phearlaptop> I'm sure
21:31:31 <Bio> =O
21:31:37 <Bio> off to fix my car weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
21:36:24 <DoT|Phone> later pon
21:40:40 <Cane> Camail, how the fuck did you make nether brick useful?
21:40:58 <Cane> That might be the greatest accomplishment on the server so far.
21:43:13 <CockRoach|42> very carefully
21:44:42 <Cane> I'm really impressed by the staircase leading up to it.
21:46:24 <Camail> it was just the right color in this texture pack, luckily
21:46:31 <Camail> accents ftw
21:46:34 <Cane> Camail just won Minecraft I think.
21:46:50 <Cane> One of the best buildings on the server by far, and it has nether brick.
21:47:14 <Camail> world edit made everything 1000 times easier to design
21:47:25 <Camail> never would have gottent hat far with revisions if i had to do everything myself
21:48:30 <Cane> Yeah, that's why creative is such a crutch, I usually design shit there now before doing anything in survival.
21:48:35 <Camail> there's a ton of stuff missing though, I've never been good at doing minecraft interiors and it needs a landscape
21:49:07 <Camail> thats what i started in the back, havent brought it further
21:49:15 <Cane> Just like every other big structure on the server, it's as empty as Camail's heart.
21:49:40 <Camail> <         3
21:49:49 <Cane> Well if the thing ever gets placed on the main map (and it should because it's fucking glorious, I might just start digging for resources for it right now)
21:49:58 <Cane> I'd probably try to do some kind of landscaping for it.
21:50:06 <Cane> But it depends on what you want because it's your project.
21:50:26 <Cane> Also I'm a pony again.
21:50:33 <Cane> Mine Little Pony was finally updated.
21:50:35 <Camail> you have free reign over it, tbh, do whatever you want
21:50:37 <Camail> oh nice
21:50:42 <Cane> Well I say that, but really someone just got sick of waiting for it and made a fork.
21:50:48 <Camail> i was wondering if that would ever happen
21:50:51 <Cane> Same here.
21:50:59 <Cane> 1.6.4 I think was the last one that had MLP.
21:51:10 <Cane> Then we went to 1.7 and we haven't had it for years.
21:51:19 <Cane> And 1.7 turned to 1.8 and we still didn't have it.
21:51:25 <Cane> They finally made it for both 1.7 and 1.8 now.
21:52:20 <Camail> time heals all pony wounds
21:55:30 <DoT|Phone> but are there zebras
21:56:01 <Cane> There are.
21:56:10 <Cane> The new version has all races.
21:56:50 <DoT|Phone> woohoo
21:57:03 <Cane> Also Camail, I'm pretty sure this is your purgatory I found.

23:34:44 <motbob> Ozy and Millie was really good
23:35:28 <Camail_> holy shit they drew "i drew this"
23:35:30 <Camail_> i had 0 idea
23:35:44 <Camail_> i assumed they just died once the comic stopped
23:37:35 <Camail_> damn i never made the connection in my mind
