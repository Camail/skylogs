03:12:46 <ZK> 23
03:13:02 <Micen|Droid> 23 isnt so old
03:13:18 <Micen|Droid> Its how old I will remain until October
03:13:18 <ZK> when i first joined TLP i was 18
03:14:02 <Micen|Droid> 17 when I started watching ponies. 
03:14:19 <Crisium> u young
03:14:47 <Crisium> when i turned 23 there weren't even ponies
03:15:06 <Crisium> though they started a couple months later
03:16:27 <Micen|Droid> Cris old horse. 
03:16:37 * Micen|Droid pats cris-pon
03:18:35 <DuB`> ZK Cris so old.

03:20:24 <DuB`> WEE.
03:20:30 <Crisium> yay im old
03:20:36 <Crisium> time to tell you about the good ol days
03:20:46 <Crisium> um
03:20:51 <Crisium> 90s nick was good tv
03:21:05 <Crisium> ya'll missed it
03:21:13 <Micen|Droid> I didnt. 
03:21:35 <Crisium> you watched the original run of pete and pete?
03:21:39 <Micen|Droid> Yes
03:21:58 <Micen|Droid> Though I always was more fond of Clarissa Explains it All
03:23:00 <Crisium> what year you born in?
03:23:06 <Micen|Droid> 1992
03:23:28 <Crisium> i guess a 1-4 year old could have watched it technically :P
03:23:55 <Crisium> tho nick did show 90s shows on repeats well into the late 90s
03:24:02 <Micen|Droid> That and the vhs recordings of Snick
03:24:07 <Crisium> but 93-98 was the peak i think
03:24:40 <Crisium> rockos modern life also 93-96 like pete and pete

03:26:10 <Micen|Droid> Cant argue that
03:26:11 <Crisium> cause in 99 rocket power started and that was the beginning of the decline
03:26:18 <Crisium> it was not bad
03:26:22 <Crisium> but it was below par
03:26:49 <Micen|Droid> Did you know the movie Snow Day was originally a Pete and Pete movie script they retooled? 
03:27:05 <Crisium> i did not
03:27:16 <Crisium> pete and pete still holds up because its so sureal
03:27:25 <Crisium> i watched it about 6 years ago and still enjoyed it
03:27:40 <Crisium> nostalgia helps, but i think anyone can appreciate it
03:30:41 <Micen|Droid> I need to watch it again soon

21:43:22 <Runbunny> Nah you're kinda going to the wrong end of bottom.
21:43:28 <Camail__> jump
21:43:31 <Camail__> down
21:43:35 <Runbunny> you must ring the second bell Dot.
21:44:00 <DoT`> the only place i havnt been now is where the large guys holding rocks are
21:46:51 <DoT`> if i knew where it was angel!
21:51:05 <DoT`> nope nope nope
21:51:16 <DoT`> i dont want to go near the definat spider den
21:51:23 <Micen__> thats where you need to go
21:53:14 <Runbunny> Are you not the chosen undead Dot?
21:53:14 <Runbunny> Aren't you the guy who rings the bells?
21:53:37 <DoT`> not anymore!
21:54:00 <DoT`> i have 1 mm of health and no vials! time to kill this thing
21:55:13 <DoT`> i think it went well
21:59:05 <DoT`> i was invaded! and won 
22:01:31 <Runbunny> man-eater Mildred?
22:02:02 <DoT`> i think so
22:03:38 <Runbunny> That's an npc invasion, but nicely done dot.
22:03:50 <Runbunny> surely you'll be a master in no time.
22:04:18 <DoT`> its something!
22:04:20 <DoT`> :P
22:05:18 <DoT`> always getting poisend by water
22:06:47 <DoT`> i lost 7 humanity
22:06:59 <DoT`> because controls are bad

22:20:51 <DoT`> m/k
22:21:30 <Micen__> thers your issue with the controller. It is so much better with a controller
22:21:47 <DoT`> new record! survived like 20 seconds then got caught in legs while attacking
22:21:58 <DoT`> well thats a great help micen
22:22:05 <DoT`> i dont have one
22:22:15 <DoT`> and suck with controllers anyway
22:22:29 <DoT`> ive maybe used 1 for 20 minutes in my life
22:22:35 <Micen__> ahh. 
22:24:37 <Micen__> Dot, did you run things like DSfix? 
22:24:45 <Micen__> or put it in there. 
22:25:14 <Micen__> http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/top/?
22:25:26 <Micen__> DSfix, and mouse fix should help you out a bunch if you are having troubles.
22:26:04 <DoT`> i spent about an hour sorting out the mods for m/k
22:26:28 <DoT`> otherwise i wouldnt have got further tthan 10 mnutes

22:29:35 <Micen__> ahh okay, just wanted to make sure. 
22:29:49 <Micen__> and TLA zk?
22:29:56 <ZK> the last airbender
22:30:00 <Micen__> ahh
22:30:04 <Micen__> i blanked
22:30:13 <Micen__> I finally finished that not too long ago
22:30:13 <ZK> i should buy korra eventually
22:30:17 <Micen__> i need to watch Korra
22:30:18 <Runbunny> Don't bother with mouse controls and play on keyboard only O:
22:30:21 <ZK> iyd htrsy idny iy?
22:30:25 <ZK> its great isnt it?*
22:30:50 <Micen__> It was, but the ending felt very kids show. 
22:31:04 <ZK> I thought it was so great
22:31:18 <ZK> Good ending != kids show
22:31:35 <ZK> unless you just mean the kiss, or you mean the way the evil was defeated?
22:31:45 <ZK> Cause the lead-up and final fight were all so damn great
22:32:02 <Micen__> I mean the Azula part is what I am talking about
22:32:19 <skram> i just feel sad for azula
22:32:21 <skram> shes like 14
22:32:48 <ZK> I loved that Zuko coming into his own to defeat Azule himself, but then Katara having a say in it
22:33:10 <ZK> Zuko not defeating her on his own was good
22:33:18 <DoT`> bleeehhhhhh
22:33:24 <DoT`> fight is hard
22:34:09 <Micen__> based on the way the characters develped Zuko would have killed her, espically after hurting Katara. OR Katra would have been like "I dont have a choice, she is too crazy. time to do some crazy bloodbending stuff."
