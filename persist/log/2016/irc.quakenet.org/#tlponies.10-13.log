04:18:28 <Camail> dub tomorrow is critical role, i am excited and i dont know why
04:19:05 <DuB`> I'm still on ep10. >:T
04:19:08 <DuB`> TIIIME
04:19:11 <Camail> lul
04:19:24 <Camail> tomorrow is the 71st ep
04:19:28 <Camail> gg no re
04:20:07 <Camail> the funny thing is that they are in their primary arc right now and you could totally skip to it
04:20:20 <Camail> like 100% this is the last arc for their characters
04:22:55 <Camail> the underdark arc, and the slayers take arc are probably the only really important arcs
04:23:08 <Camail> though i am not sure if those are the only other 2 arcs
04:24:14 <Camail> the cow episode is nice
04:27:02 <Bio> i wanna watch them play from new chars
04:33:31 <Camail> travis is gonna play a smart guy which is fun
04:33:42 <Camail> cuz he's pretty clever but he has to be a dumb ass
04:33:56 <Camail> and all the one-offs he's played smart people

04:56:34 <DuB`> Your HEALTH, though!
04:57:16 <skram> Aaaww are you worried about me?
04:57:41 <DuB`> Always.
04:57:42 <DuB`> So worried.
04:57:57 <skram> I will be fine, mr. dub
04:57:58 <DuB`> Camail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oFI7khOhtg
04:58:20 <skram> I only look like im 42! Im actually much younger, you see.
05:01:15 <Camail> oh hey look at me
05:01:21 <Camail> not clicking that link
05:01:42 <DuB`> >:T
05:01:53 <DuB`> It is #1 best, though!
05:02:42 <skram> Okay. If you want your life to be poor and meaningless, that is your prerogative
05:06:13 <motbob> this video's questionable
05:08:13 <motbob> what might be the appeal of this video. let me try to analyze
05:08:36 <motbob> the song sucks. can't be that/
05:08:51 <motbob> there are groups with better dancing routines and execution. probably not that
05:09:07 <motbob> the costumes are quite vivid but I don't think that can be enough
05:09:28 <motbob> it must be that these girls (and one boy) are 13/14 years old
05:09:41 <motbob> i mean, that's really what makes the video special
05:10:11 <motbob> so then we have to delve into what about the fact that these are young teens is so appealing
05:10:18 <motbob> which I'm not sure I want to do
05:10:25 <motbob> thank you for reading my analysis
05:21:24 <DuB`> motbob this is heresy it is the best song ever and I don't even watch the video I just listen on repeat plsandthankyou.

05:27:40 <Camail> guess what i got
05:27:42 <Camail> from a loot box
05:27:45 <DuB`> Wot!
05:27:47 <DuB`> Mercy!?
05:27:49 <Camail> yup
05:27:53 <DuB`> Khahahahaaa
05:28:02 <DuB`> I bought it, RIP $$$
05:28:08 <Camail> rip all ur $
05:29:10 <Camail> it makes up for the awful team that over extended all the time
05:29:47 <Camail> man i wish valve made a ban system like blizzard
05:29:59 <Camail> would end like 90% of hacking
05:31:38 <DuB`> As in detection or the extent of the ban?
05:32:13 <Camail> as in banning your pc
05:32:33 <Camail> the detection in OW is waaay worse
05:32:40 <Camail> if only because there havent been many OW hacks
05:33:52 <DuB`> Right.
05:34:20 <Camail> but detection is like...hardly even useful as a metric
05:34:41 <Camail> because smart people like making money and are amoral fuck bags
05:35:52 <Camail> i think the claritin finally kicked in
05:36:32 <Camail> .tell dot` i opened it, rip ur 3k I'm da bes
05:38:44 <Camail> so jesse cox is the only streamer left on twitch with the old grandfather sub contract
05:38:52 <Camail> where its $3 and a one time payment
05:39:08 <Camail> so basically, one free prime month and you're forever subbed
05:39:09 <Camail> i think
05:39:17 <Camail> its a corner case and we'll see how they handle it
05:39:39 <Camail> also cuz all his subs are permanent he has soooooooo many emotes
05:40:03 <Camail> 41 emotes lul
05:44:16 <motbob> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhxH6Lgsklg
06:01:25 <Camail> mot, analyze ken bone cuz i dont see why i should care
06:01:41 <motbob> OK
06:01:48 <motbob> let me pull uo the debae footage
06:03:20 <motbob> well OK that was pretty much unremarkable, but then this happened http://i.imgur.com/ssXjnyY.png
06:04:06 <motbob> there were a series of pictures like this, not all as meanspirited, and someone coined the phrase "bone zone" which rhymes
06:04:31 <Camail> ok so its basically like th YSG thing at AGDQ
06:04:43 <Camail> where they pick someone who looks weird and runs with it
06:05:00 <motbob> i dunno. you have to realize that shit that happens in debates is PRIMO meme material because debates have a big audience
06:05:38 <Camail> i was just confused by the random ass articles all over news sites
06:05:48 <Camail> couldn't get a bead on the tone of the joke

14:54:54 <skram> Providing reliable service to hot camgirls and weebs with vibrators
14:56:01 <Runbunny> I am fairly certain that, writing that would get Dot expelled.
