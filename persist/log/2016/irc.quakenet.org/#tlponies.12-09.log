02:48:01 <skram> though some of the pro teams have tried
02:48:07 <Crisium> just give him 250 hp
02:48:17 <carcinisation> if they make torb or bastion balance vs good teams
02:48:30 <carcinisation> then it will be nightmare at my level
02:48:47 <Crisium> can torbjs hammer heal bastion?
02:49:06 <skram> torbj√∏rn hates omnics cris
02:49:16 <Crisium> but turrets are robots
02:49:18 <Crisium> hypocrit
02:49:31 <skram> turrents dont have sentience
02:49:39 <Crisium> are you sure
02:49:39 <skram> bro read the lore
02:49:44 <Crisium> turrets aim pretty fast
02:49:46 <carcinisation> but portal skram
02:49:47 <Crisium> sounds like a person
02:49:58 <skram> different universe reif
02:50:03 <Crisium> i watched the overwatch videos blizzard made
02:50:08 <Crisium> no torb video
02:50:12 <skram> should read the comics
02:50:14 <skram> they're good
02:50:24 <Crisium> perhaps
02:50:36 <carcinisation> gonna try 1 more game then give up
02:51:38 <Crisium> i like how theres a story, but no story mode, and overwatch characters get all chatty in the pre-game, but put reaper and winston on the same team and its fine
02:52:00 <skram> its not like any of it makes any real sense
02:52:06 <Crisium> there needs to be more bad guys
02:52:11 <Crisium> only 3 ffs
02:52:15 <skram> why is reaper/widow/sombra with overwatch
02:52:23 <skram> why are they fighting other overwatch people
02:52:41 <skram> why is overwatching nuking london
02:52:44 <Crisium> cause terrorism something something
02:52:50 <skram> why are they rescuing a movie director
02:52:52 <Crisium> robots something
02:52:59 <Micen> Because if they were not,  you wouldn't have a fun game.
02:53:24 <Crisium> its ok, bastions video made everyone teary eyed
02:53:29 <Crisium> good story confirmed
02:54:42 <Crisium> they should get guest characters
02:55:00 <Crisium> kerrigan can use psi storm as her ult
02:55:13 <skram> plas no
02:55:16 <Bio> beep boop
02:55:33 <Camail> cris they tried making overwatch have a story, that was what their failed project for like 8 years was
02:55:45 <Camail> then they decided to just make it tf2 instead
02:55:56 <Crisium> good idea
02:56:44 <Camail> fun fact skram, the movie director is Travis, aka Grog from critical role
02:57:05 <skram> really?
02:57:26 <Camail> also fun fact, videogames have NDAs and voice actors can never talk until a game is released so friends get to find out who else has been in the game with them on release
02:57:31 <Micen> speaking of Critical Role, its about that time.
02:57:33 <Camail> ya, he said so when ow came out
02:57:47 <skram> i usually notice these things
02:58:02 <Camail> unless a game has mocap, then actors usually know, or if htey are main characters
02:58:05 <Crisium> speaking of ow and voice actors, how about that tracer
02:58:28 <Bio> cheerz lub
02:58:50 <Camail> I'm a big fan of all things british accent
02:58:58 <Camail> the harder it is to understand, the better
02:59:27 <Crisium> i am always disappointed that i understand 98% of what jeremy clarkson says
02:59:29 <Camail> oh wow day9 is streaming
02:59:30 <Crisium> should be 50%
02:59:33 <Camail> how often does he stream anymore
02:59:52 <Crisium> he should do BW daily's again
02:59:56 <Camail> often enough to have 6k viewers, apparently
03:00:01 <Crisium> now that BW is more popular than SC2 again
03:00:22 <Camail> prety sure he would ahte playing bw
03:00:29 <Camail> imagine palying a game you were amazing at
03:00:30 <Camail> and being bad

03:03:52 <Camail> yaaay...
03:04:09 <Crisium> at least it wasnt real player
03:04:18 <Camail> but that at least had porn
03:04:32 <skram> it did?
03:04:45 <Camail> a lot of porn was using real player
03:04:55 <skram> oh right
03:05:23 <Camail> if porn couldnt boost the real player popularity literally nothing could

13:30:54 <Dot`> hey zk
13:34:59 <ZK> i like the new spider man trailer
13:35:02 <ZK> good characters
13:40:27 <ZK> im really happy they included ganke
13:41:24 <Dot`> is it another redo or continuation of one of the other spiderman movies
13:41:51 <Dot`> i dont know much spiderman but they do seem to keep making movies that contain his orogin
13:42:00 <ZK> redo, with cnotinuation with rest of marvel universe like captain america civil war
13:42:07 <Dot`> ah
13:42:11 <ZK> they dont do his origin in this one
13:42:22 <ZK> its a coming of age movie with superhero
13:42:30 <Dot`> but its seprate again from the other movoes?
13:42:37 <ZK> yea, well iron man is in it
13:42:37 <Dot`> movies&
13:42:41 <ZK> but seperate
13:42:58 <ZK> all other spider man movies had spidey in college, this is first one where he stays in high school forever
13:43:14 <ZK> and they use someone that look like a legit 15 year old
13:43:29 <Dot`> i forgot he was that young
13:43:55 <ZK> eh, in comics he was only that young for ~30 comics
13:44:13 <ZK> of course that was 3 years back then, but still, out of 2700 comics, 30 is not much
13:44:23 <Dot`> thats many comics
13:44:41 <ZK> well, 800 in the main series, there were times when he had 2-3 on him at the same time
13:45:46 <ZK> if you want, i can recommend a great spidey series =D its not that big and self contained
13:45:58 <ZK> also it's a high school super hero drama
13:46:15 <Dot`> most comics i ever read was Asterix and obelix
13:46:42 <Dot`> and y book list to read is still far too long
13:46:43 <ZK> those are good
13:46:47 <Dot`> my*
13:46:48 <ZK> i have all of those as well
13:46:59 <ZK> but these are comic books!
13:47:04 <ZK> its different :P
13:47:19 <Dot`> yes
13:48:26 <Dot`> Inno, Uthermal and hero streaming
13:48:28 <ZK> look for "ultimate spider man"
13:48:35 <ZK> yea, im watchin uthermal, but its his last game
13:49:32 <ZK> ultimate spider man is a new version of spidey that stararted in 1920
13:49:39 <ZK> 2000*
13:49:41 <Dot`> i want to see uthermal do nates strats, would be funny
13:49:47 <Dot`> comic timelines are hard
13:49:52 <ZK> thats why you read that one
13:50:06 <ZK> its on its own and doesnt care about the regular timeline
13:50:15 <Dot`> well it sin the list, will i ever get there? who knows?! we can hope
13:50:21 <ZK> its just cool and does its own thing
13:50:23 <ZK> yayyyyyy
13:50:54 <Dot`> next on the list is terry pratchet, i REALLY need to get around to reading his stuff
13:50:56 <ZK> how many super hero coming of age series you got in your reading list Dot` :o this ones greatttttttt
13:51:11 <ZK> hmm, i think i had started a book of his, but couldnt get into it
13:52:01 <Dot`> the thing that keeps putting me off is how hyped up his stuff is and it gives such large expectations
13:54:05 <ZK> hmm, maybe i didnt read terry pratchet
13:54:07 <ZK> discworld
13:54:15 <Dot`> yea, discworld
13:55:21 <ZK> 41 books
13:55:22 <ZK> hm
13:55:46 <Dot`> i dont believe they are very long books
13:55:52 <Dot`> more novel length
13:58:34 <ZK> well, im downloading too
14:19:38 <Rawr|Fone> I can confirm that discworld is great
