21:34:03 <Camail> SK is the BR juggernaut that destroys cs for the first part of the year
21:34:20 <Camail> they've cooled down a bit as people laerned their style
21:35:10 <Camail> VP is very old school and haven't changed their line up in years
21:35:23 <Camail> so the community grew attached to them
21:35:44 <Camail> damn taco waht a sick spot
