10:50:35 <Yolteotl> no aoa
10:50:39 <Yolteotl> I think it's over
10:51:53 <DoT`> what is that the terrans building
10:51:57 <DoT`> dont see those anymore
10:52:08 <Yolteotl> bunkers?
10:52:32 <Yolteotl> or cyclons?
10:52:50 <DoT`> the rocket car
10:52:55 <Yolteotl> cyclon
10:53:14 <Yolteotl> they are good against oracle
10:54:25 <DoT`> yea, but they got nerfed and suddenly no one built them at all
10:55:00 <Yolteotl> they fixed some bugs
10:55:09 <Yolteotl> may be more use-able now
10:55:50 <DoT`> Runbunny, http://imgur.com/gallery/PKYr2
10:58:35 <Yolteotl> my ISP fixed internet
10:58:42 <Yolteotl> and gave me one free month
10:59:01 <Yolteotl> Terran Cyclones will no longer move all the way into auto-attack range (range 5) after using the Lock On ability (range 7). Note that this does not prevent the Cyclone from inching forward while the ability is activating. Flying Barracks will now take a higher subgroup priority than Flying Factory and Flying Starport.
11:01:33 <Runbunny> yeah dot there's a lot of dark souls going around these days

20:21:34 <Yolteotl> "If further changes are needed here, we believe changing the Liberator AA damage to be +Light instead of dealing full damage to everything, and further increasing the Banshee speed upgrade effectiveness could be a viable next step." hmm
20:22:01 <Yolteotl> if they do this, I don't see how terran will deal against broodlord corrruptor viper
20:23:00 <Yolteotl> ultras are already painful to deal with, don't add another T3 viable comp for the zerg :/
20:25:34 <DoT`> i see a lot of lib abuse still with AA, but i dont know, the lib is far better than it was, its not just killing everything
20:25:48 <DoT`> and zerg have parasite which mass kills air
20:33:52 <DuB`> Skipped bus and strolled home because nice weather!
20:34:45 <Yolteotl> yes, but terran relies on liberators to stay alive in late game
20:34:55 <Yolteotl> if you remove this tool, you have to give another
20:35:15 <Yolteotl> or it will be the same thing that happened when they nerfed widow mine back on HotS
20:35:33 <Yolteotl> that was the only cost effective AoE terran had
20:35:53 <Yolteotl> and they had to revert this change some months later because terrans were just destroyed
20:36:04 <DuB`> Give protoss spear of adun orbital laser.
20:36:08 <DuB`> Only logical choice.
