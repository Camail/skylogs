02:09:32 <Dot`> skram requires a supply of cat pics or he gets grouchy
02:09:34 <skram> READ ME A BED TIME STORY DUB
02:09:40 <skram> ONE ABOUT CATS
02:09:44 <skram> PLURAL
02:10:32 <Dot`> there once was a cat, it was actually 2 cats, the end
02:10:58 <skram> NO LESS THAN 7 CATS WILL SATISFY ME
02:11:17 <Dot`> then 8 more cats walked in
02:11:34 <skram> You're terrible at this.
02:11:36 <Dot`> they did cat things
02:11:43 <skram> go on
02:11:50 <Dot`> wow skram, so rude
02:11:54 <Dot`> im done then
02:12:12 <Dot`> i tried and you could only be critical
02:12:37 <skram> Well I APOLOGIZE THEN for having CONFIDENCE IN YOUR LITERARY ABILITIES
02:15:44 <ZK> ?zkfanfics
02:15:56 <ZK> dot and phearlock are cats in the second one
02:16:21 <Dot`> >.>
02:16:28 <ZK> oh wait, the first sentence contradicts that, darn
02:16:53 <DuB> skram that was spooky.
02:17:03 <DuB> The witcher quest I'm on just had me going to the Seven Cats Inn.
02:17:25 <ZK> there once was a witcher
02:17:29 <ZK> he entered the seven cats inn
02:17:34 <ZK> there were eight cats there
02:17:46 <skram> SERENDIPITY
02:17:48 <ZK> however, as that wasn't what the sign said, the witcher killed one
02:17:55 <skram> sadness :(
02:17:58 <ZK> there were now only 7 cats in the secen cats inn
02:18:03 <ZK> but then they had sex
02:18:12 <ZK> and a few months later there were 10 cats
02:18:21 <skram> disgust
02:18:22 <ZK> but no witcher was there to kill them
02:18:24 <skram> but also intrigue
02:18:30 <Dot`> sounds like order was brought to the land
02:18:31 <ZK> so the inn had to rename itself to ten cats inn
02:18:42 <ZK> Then  a zebra arrived
02:18:45 <ZK> and ate a cat
02:18:51 <ZK> then another
02:18:55 <ZK> and another
02:19:02 <skram> I need to buy a better computer so I can play witcher too
02:19:13 <ZK> The end.
02:19:13 <skram> I would pay a thousand dollarinos to visit this inn
02:19:18 <skram> very good zk
02:19:25 <ZK> stupid zebras
02:19:33 <ZK> they should be the ones that disappear, not long neck horses
02:20:05 <ZK> see Dot`, the trick to a good story is death and sex
02:20:19 <Dot`> ahh
02:20:38 <Dot`> i did say they dd cat things, and those are 2 cat things
02:20:44 <DuB> It's quite the game, skram.
02:20:53 <DuB> Like nothing I've played.
02:20:54 <ZK> stories are boring if its just mundane normal life tho
02:20:56 <Dot`> along with coughing furballs and ignoring ppl
02:21:04 <ZK> you never played witcher 2 dub? :o
02:21:10 <DuB> Naw.
02:21:25 <ZK> thats why theres death and sex, something that isnt regular for cats
02:21:48 <Dot`> cats are murdering all the time
02:22:02 <Dot`> its pretty normal for them
02:22:07 <skram> I played witcher 2
02:22:11 <skram> it was confusing and boring
02:22:15 <ZK> witcher 3 is much better
02:22:20 <ZK> less linear
02:22:40 <skram> i dont mind linearity if its done well
02:22:43 <ZK> but story is a big part still, so maybe still confusing?
02:23:17 <skram> i dont really have the attention span to wander round an open world for 80 hours anymore
02:23:47 <ZK> i think its closer to 120 hours?
02:23:57 <ZK> but yea, i played 30 hours, then took a break and havent gone back since
02:24:02 <ZK> will definitely go back sooner or later
03:30:16 <Bio> evening

12:17:42 <Rawr|Phone> I found a growlithe
12:18:08 <Dot`> yay!
12:18:19 <Dot`> how they look nowdays in the new games?
12:18:30 <Rawr|Phone> Great
12:18:37 <Dot`> good
12:18:53 <Rawr|Phone> I haven't played any of the newer games
12:19:08 <Rawr|Phone> The graphics are actually pretty good
12:19:26 <Rawr|Phone> But I think it's harder to navigate 
12:24:10 <Rawr|Phone> Although the absolute best thing is that HMs seem to be gone
12:24:58 <Dot`> interisintg
12:37:26 <Micen>  yeah, they said they decided that they would rather have you have a team of Pokemon that you want, rather than be forced to carry something that had HMs so you could get to areas.
12:38:01 <Dot`> sounds reasnable
12:38:26 <Dot`> .tell Bio https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2016/12/8/1312322.png
12:38:34 <Phearlock> Yeah, it's nice how a lot of the good fanmade games did away with HMs

12:54:07 <Micen> new being a relative term.
12:54:08 <Dot`> its not referncing greeting new people
12:54:41 <Micen> you have been promoted from doormat
12:55:10 <Micen> you are now the mat that you stand on while doing dishes so water doesnt splash everywhere on the floor.
12:56:34 <Rawr|Phone> I don't think that is a promotion
12:57:14 <Micen> its further in the house. less dirt from the outside.

18:05:17 <Dot`> what you up to today cane
18:05:49 <skram> its alright zounds
18:05:57 <skram> havent played all that much since i hit masters though
18:06:29 <Zounds> masters? pretty nice man
18:06:53 <skram> Yeah I got really lucky with teammates
18:07:02 <skram> not a single genji main in sight
18:07:24 <Zounds> What's good these days anyway
18:07:40 <skram> 3 tanks and a soldier
18:07:51 <skram> with nanoboosted tac visor
18:07:57 <Dot`> that sounds odd
18:08:02 <Zounds> I can see how that would be annoying
18:08:03 <Dot`> 3 tanks
18:08:07 <Zounds> Rein shield + defence matrix
18:08:22 <Zounds> maybe a roadhog to kill stray guys or when the shield goes down
18:08:24 <skram> tanks are just beefy dps dot
18:08:41 <Dot`> i guess..
18:08:46 <Zounds> I always kinda saw roadhog as a dps
18:08:59 <skram> yeah
18:09:16 <Dot`> Roadhog is a one man apocalypse
18:09:38 <skram> pharah shows up kinda often now too
18:09:44 <Zounds> Next time pons stack I might try sombra out
18:10:01 <Dot`> is the stmmetra patch through yet?
18:10:03 <skram> sombra is fun
18:10:04 <skram> no
