12:04:10 <Lynda> apparently there are fractal genes that codify fractal-esque branching of neurons or that of pulmonary system subunits (bronchis, bronchioles, etc.) or that of capillaries
12:04:27 <Lynda> because if they didn't codify just the fractal aspect, then there wouldn't exist enough genes to codify each branching

22:30:43 <DoT`> Runbunny, ive tried today
22:31:03 <DoT`> after spending over an hour modding it becuase of the AWEFUL job they did porting it
22:32:19 <Bio> dotpon dotpon
22:32:30 <DoT`> bio bio
22:36:27 <Runbunny> you only need Dsfix.
22:36:41 <Runbunny> and have a controller i guess. Just never use the mouse.
22:36:44 <Runbunny> and it's fine.
22:36:54 <DoT`> i have no controller
22:37:07 <DoT`> you have to add about 4 things to dsfix
22:37:19 <Runbunny> Then do what I did. and play keyboard only.
22:37:32 <DoT`> that would be even worse D:
22:37:33 <Runbunny> not really. Just install dsfix and then unlock fps.
22:37:37 <Runbunny> Nah
22:38:37 <DoT`> the amount of times ive died already off cliffs becuase the game decided i needed to roll twice
22:38:42 <DoT`> or do a backflip

22:39:31 <Bio> FASION HORSES
22:39:38 <Runbunny> You can store imputs. but that just sounds weird. 
22:39:42 <Runbunny> Did you do something?
22:39:54 <Bio> Lovely Funny New Friend
22:40:00 <skram> i bet you did something
22:40:28 <DoT`> i tihn kits the stupid kick action messing up
22:40:51 <Runbunny> well either that or you're rolling from the mouse.
22:40:51 <carcinisation> MAY VARY FROM ILLUSTRATION
22:41:07 <DoT`> space bar is running/rolling
22:41:33 <Runbunny> kick is forward plus attack. 
22:41:39 <Runbunny> Then how do you get 2xroll?
22:42:12 <DoT`> but thats just it, i have no idea how it leapt off sideways
22:42:14 <Bio> LOL
22:42:18 <Bio> On the MLG stream
22:42:22 <Bio> TACTICLE TIME OUT
22:42:46 <DoT`> i might have clicked w before attacking to get into range, but there was no side clicks!
22:43:19 <DoT`> ive died to bad camra angles as well
22:43:54 <DuB`> http://www.twitch.tv/gosugamers
22:43:59 <Runbunny> So you accidentally kicked, pressed sideways and roll because panic. which was stored till after kick and then you rolled off to your doom.
22:44:26 <DoT`> there shouldnt have been any sideways
22:44:28 <Runbunny> Yeah you need to control the camera, think of it as another enemy.
22:44:40 <DoT`> haha
22:44:41 <Runbunny> you must have pressed it.
22:44:57 <DoT`> i dont trust the targeter thing
22:45:07 <DoT`> but have to use it becuase bad camra
22:45:15 <DoT`> and it can make the camra even worse
22:45:47 <DoT`> this game is a great salt mine
22:45:56 <DoT`> via bad controls
22:46:13 <Runbunny> You just have to think more about what you do.
