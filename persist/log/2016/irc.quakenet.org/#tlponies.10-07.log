00:15:08 <Dot`> catch up on pony i hope
00:21:15 <Cane> skram: I have a lot. The biggest batch was the building footage by far.
00:21:24 <Cane> That was 25+ hours of just building the valley.
00:22:07 <Cane> I finished the playthrough though, the series is just a long editing process. =)
00:22:58 <skram> How many tries did it take you to finish? :p
00:30:18 <Cane> And not die you mean?
00:30:25 <skram> Yeah
00:30:33 <Cane> This video series chronicles my seventh attempt to make it happen.

00:30:37 <Cane> The other six did not go as well.
00:31:01 <skram> hardcore mode is !fun!
00:31:09 <Cane> Hahah it really is
00:31:19 <Cane> I just wish fewer of those deaths were player stupidity.
00:31:47 <skram> Its always due to player stupidity, cane :p
00:31:56 <skram> At least thats what my diablo experiences tell me
00:35:30 <Dot`> Someone mention !FUN! ?

02:01:27 <Micen> https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry soon
02:01:43 <Micen> How are you tonight ZK?
02:01:52 <ZK> sore throat
02:01:55 <ZK> assignment due in 2 hours
02:01:57 <ZK> but pretty good
02:02:04 <ZK> habs winning 6-1
02:02:07 <ZK> we gonna be amazing this year
02:02:21 <ZK> howbout you?
02:02:25 <Micen> we had a red wings fan move in with us. :/
02:02:41 <Micen> friend of the family needed a place for a bit.
02:03:53 <Micen> but im good for the most part. Even if a job i thought i had didnt work out. 
02:04:01 <ZK> its ok, red wings wont make playoffs this year
02:04:23 <Micen> I know .
02:04:36 <Micen> but he was holding that they took a game off the hawks.
02:04:50 <Micen> I told him that even blind dogs find bones once in awhile.
02:05:04 <Micen> He got mad because he had to agree
02:05:13 <ZK> i dont realy have any ill will against detroit tho
02:05:22 <ZK> mostly boston toronto
02:05:28 <ZK> aand ottawa
02:05:45 <ZK> somewhat tampa
02:05:58 <Micen> i was at some filthy blue jay fans house.
02:06:05 <ZK> and now im a nashville fan in the west, although i still like blues
02:06:26 <Micen> friend of his. Nice people even if they have bad tastes in teams.
02:06:49 <ZK> lol
02:06:57 <ZK> as canadian, im supposed to like blue jays
02:07:04 <ZK> but i dont like baseball in general soooo
02:07:36 <Micen> its the Cubs years
02:07:38 <Micen> year*
02:07:48 <Micen> Wish i could go back in time.
02:07:52 <Micen> Bet some money on the Cubbies.
02:08:24 <Micen> Critical Role time.
02:16:27 <ZK> hehe
02:16:41 <ZK> id like to try crit role, but would be too much to catch up
02:17:13 <Micen> its only like 2.5 months of binge watching to catch up. its nice to listen to while doing polaces or cleaning or stuff like that,
02:17:42 <Micen> in actuality you could just watch this most recent arc and catch up
02:19:10 <Micen> and be caught up in a few weeks. its worth it. 
02:22:29 <ZK> maybe
02:22:53 <ZK> I love listening to roleplaying podcasts on the bus, but hten i cant do anything else since if i do i miss a big part of the story

03:13:46 <Camail> OH SHIT
03:13:52 <Camail> CSGO GOT GRAFITTI BACK
03:13:53 <Camail> YES
03:14:04 <Camail> sadly
03:14:07 <Camail> they arent custom
03:14:15 <Camail> they are bullshit skins
03:14:23 <Camail> I WANT MY RANDOM GOATSE BACK
03:14:34 <skram> im not going to play cs until i can use my goatse spray again
03:14:39 <skram> ..
03:15:24 <Camail> h, oh and it gets better
03:15:26 <Camail> they are limited
03:15:34 <Camail> only 50 uses per purchae or drop
03:15:37 <Camail> never mind fuck valve
03:15:54 <Camail> i expected nothing and i am fucking disappointed
03:16:10 <Camail> like holy shit thats retarded
03:16:51 <skram> valve has been retarded for quite some time now
03:17:37 <motbob> valve added a feature and you're worse off
03:17:45 <motbob> the wonders of the human mind
03:17:54 <Camail> the m4a1 sound and now this
03:18:13 <Camail> features can make a game worse
03:18:31 <motbob> well
03:18:52 <Camail> any game designer will tell you that feature bloat is important
03:18:57 <motbob> the extent to which this feature makes the game worse is based around how there's not enough of the feature
03:19:04 <motbob> which seems contradictory
03:19:33 <Camail> no, its worse because its a shell of a feature we once had in the community
03:19:49 <Camail> and tis a shell in a way that emphasizes an aspect of the developer we all dont like
03:20:30 <Camail> they added sprays to generate money from there barely not gambling method of making money
03:20:36 <Camail> their*
03:20:40 <motbob> that seems consistent with the "there's not enough of the feature" theory
03:20:54 <Camail> no, I'd rater not have it at all fi this sit he form its in
03:21:26 <Camail> also that still doesn't change the fact that its a bad feature
03:21:31 <Camail> in a vacuum its dumb
03:21:51 <Camail> and in context the only reason we want sprays is because they wre in the other games
03:22:38 <Camail> i get that you're playing devil's advocate but its pretty indefensible
03:22:48 <Camail> it improves nothing
03:22:54 <Camail> they messed with sounds and fixed a molly bug
03:22:57 <Camail> so thats nice
03:23:11 <Camail> hopefully the m4a1 isn't as fucked as they made it last patch
03:24:28 <motbob> i;m not really playing devil's advocate
03:24:36 <Camail> skram  next up: csgo pachinko machine
03:26:01 <Camail> ok so, what's your point? That we shouldn't complain about new features?
03:26:14 <motbob> well, it's sort of like:
03:26:32 <Camail> and how is disliking a feature's implementation contradictory with the desire for that feature
03:26:50 <Camail> I'm hella lagging so brb

03:31:05 <motbob> honestly Valve should just stop putting resources into CS:GO if they've lost the community this hard
03:32:20 <Camail> they haven't? I'm not echoing reddit, I'm fine with most changes
03:32:22 <Camail> most people are
03:32:26 <Camail> infact they fixed a lotr ecently
03:32:40 <Camail> its just that when they do dumb stuff, they go hard
03:33:43 <Camail> I mean, have you been actively looking at every patch for csgo in the last year? do you have the information to make this judgment?
03:33:51 <motbob> ?
03:33:55 <Camail> there is a tension there, but there are many key things they changed that we love
03:33:56 <motbob> sorry
03:34:14 <motbob> look
03:34:34 <motbob> i can't explain your and reddit's reaction without thinking that y'all must hate valve with a fucking passion
03:34:54 <Camail> because you only take passing glances
03:35:00 <motbob> well, ok, there is one other explanation: you are all man-children getting wroked up over literally nothing
03:35:30 <motbob> i would prefer to assume the first
03:35:31 <Camail> I mean, thats fine if you just decide to not read half the stuff i say
03:35:37 <Camail> which you apparently have a disorder for
03:35:46 <Camail> because I stated i rarely agree with reddit hate
03:36:11 <Camail> so please if you dont want to make the effort to finish a discussion don't interject
03:36:13 <motbob> sorry. i guess when I read your comments about pachinko machines, it seemed pretty damn close to that
03:37:20 <motbob> you are making a fairly direct accusation that graffiti, as implemented, is primarily meant to extract as much money from wallets as possible via psychology, since that is what a pachinko machine deos
03:37:52 <motbob> It's a logical attack given Valve's slot machine business model, and it's echoed on reddit
03:38:28 <Camail> https://clips.twitch.tv/anomalyxd/EnthusiasticHerdStrawBeary
03:38:40 <Camail> wow i didnt even think about that
03:38:56 <Camail> RIP 5 years of muscle memory and texture recognition
03:45:41 <motbob> added layer of strategy? right?

21:18:22 <Dot`> when they hit end turn
21:19:17 <Dot`> skram
21:25:13 <Golly> the order is only for the events to make sense
21:25:29 <Golly> the damage etc still happens at the same time
21:25:47 <Golly> ie. if you die that turn you still did your dmg
21:29:59 <Golly> the types of abilities have an order though
21:31:03 <Golly> its like, buffs -> sprint -> dmg ->regular moving
21:31:35 <Dot`> ah
21:31:37 <Golly> so you have to anticipate someone using a sprint

21:44:43 <Phearlock> huh

21:45:19 <Dot`> lol golly
21:45:36 <Dot`> zk, it hink you will find that kind of person is good at hiding
21:45:55 <Phearlock> Yeah I don't think that's an obvious thing
21:46:06 <ZK> yaaaa, but he was really nice. But that's the hiding thing
21:46:37 <Dot`> some of the nicest ppl i think i ever met was the couple who ended up screwing us over for months with our house sale
21:46:59 <Dot`> almost lost everything and MOTNHS of severe stress
21:47:07 <Phearlock> Yeah honestly a lot of ppl are really nice but like weird stuff, and some act on it. Often hard to really judge that unless you touch on the subject and talk to said person about it.
21:47:14 <Dot`> 2 of the nicest ppl we had met and even had 2 kids
21:47:27 <ZK> :/ They just took your stuff?
21:48:08 <Dot`> nah, it was a stupid situation
21:49:37 <Dot`> and would take far too long to type and probably make no sense if i tried

23:28:08 <motbob> I was almost hit and killed by a truck.
23:28:38 <Dot`> wow, glad you are ok mot
23:29:00 <motbob> Hennepin and Industrial Blvd. is an intersection at the foot of a hill. It is unusual in that Hennepin is a quite major road and the intersection is close to the interstate
23:29:28 <motbob> I was on Hennepin and turning left. I was stopped at the light, which was green, but there was oncoming traffic so I could not turn
23:30:02 <motbob> The oncoming traffic was coming down the steep hill (which is steep enough that cop cars are often waiting there and often have flashing lights

23:30:46 <motbob> It was rush hour so I was not able to turn left during the duration of the light. I waited for the light to turn red so that I could turn after everyone stopped
23:31:18 <motbob> The light turned yellow, then red. I was going to turn, but I saw a truck in the left-most lane, and I kept my foot off the gas pedal for whatever reason
23:31:37 <motbob> The truck ran the red light, honking. If I had turned I would have been hit.
23:32:02 <Dot`> damn, pls dont die mot
23:32:23 <motbob> Then I pulled into Wendy's, shaken, and the cashier said I looked like the lead actor from Twilight. When it rains, it pours
