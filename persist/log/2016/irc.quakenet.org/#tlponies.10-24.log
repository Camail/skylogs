00:53:14 <Bio> camail i played a single game of cs today
00:53:21 <Bio> i'm re-ranked at GN3
00:53:40 <Camail> I'm probably gn4 or something
00:53:51 <Camail> i rreranked to mg1-2 last time
00:53:57 <Camail> rank decay is real
00:55:00 <Camail> it feels weird cuz everyone around you is so bad
00:55:21 <Camail> i have no desire to play MM ever again tho
00:55:54 <Bio> yeh
00:56:03 <Bio> i'm super casual tho
00:56:05 <Bio> so its fine
00:58:16 <skram> I dont think I have actually played CS so far this year
00:58:47 <Bio> theres still time
00:58:56 <Bio> =D
00:59:14 <skram> I have absolutely no interest :p
01:23:27 <motbob> when was the last time a good esport came out
01:28:20 <Bio> broodwar kappa
01:29:01 <skram> what does good esport mean
01:34:21 <Phearlock> Malyay
01:34:32 <Phearlock> I dunno skram
01:35:02 <Phearlock> Are we counting from the first version of the esport (like first time cs became espertsy? Or just from say cs:go?)
01:39:07 <Golly> i dunno, rocket league is pretty good, battlerite maybe
01:45:18 <Phearlock> motbob, Project M =)
01:47:52 <Phearlock> (but no really, be more specific)
02:15:40 <Camail> "a good esport came out" needs a lot of unpacking, but i would call sf5 esports
02:15:45 <Camail> and sf5 is amazing
02:16:25 <Camail> maaaybe sf4 but again, vagueness makes it really hard to decide
02:16:41 <Camail> also rocket league miiiight count but its not really new, its an HD version of an older game
02:16:52 <Camail> so again, hard to pin down exactly if it fits
02:17:43 <Camail> league of legends fits esports, debatable if its good in a numbers of ways
02:18:30 <Camail> dota 2?
02:18:46 <Camail> dota 2 might be the newest one that everyone can agree on
02:18:57 <Camail> especially if you go by its full release and not the betas
02:25:38 <Camail> ok so i was trying to find what the biggest tournament for a game was
02:26:00 <Camail> I dont actually know, but my guess is the collosus tournament in WSOP, 23k entrants
02:26:06 <Camail> hmmm....that number may be inflated
02:26:32 <Camail> bcause you can enter any number of times and i dont know if they count unique entrants...they probably don't
02:29:52 <Camail> There's no clear answer, but even if half the people rebought thats like 14k entrants
02:54:01 <motbob> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPILIf7ru48
03:13:09 <motbob> the fruit flies are slowly dying
03:13:21 <motbob> there are only a quarter of a million now
