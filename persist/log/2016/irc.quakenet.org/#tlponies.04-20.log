12:35:57 <Runbunny> How else would you extrapolate it?
12:36:28 <Runbunny> Someone just makes a blank line and usuallt it is followed up by some sentence.

12:46:52 <Runbunny> That dragon is hoarding another dragon O:
12:47:02 <skram> i put my computer to sleep every night because it makes annoying noises
12:47:08 <Runbunny> or is the first dragon hoarding the second dragon which is hoarding ponies?
12:47:14 <Micen> its almost 9 am east coast us
12:47:16 <Phearlock> I'm not sure Runbunny 
12:47:45 <Micen> so somewhere between 6 and 9 in 'murrica
12:47:53 <skram> I thought east coast was like 6 hours behind GMT
12:48:47 <Micen> its -4 until fall where it becomes -5

13:32:41 <skram> but i am bad at fantasy
13:32:59 <skram> ..which kinda begs the question why im so pumped about tlpdnd
13:33:01 <skram> huh
13:33:03 <skram> whatever
13:33:41 <DoT`> i am the same skram
13:34:05 <DoT`> so far all I got is I am a wondering monk who has gained his wisdom from travel
13:34:50 <skram> im a dorf and i ran away from home because they DONT UNDERSTAND MY PAIN MOM! and then... I beat up some dudes I guess?
13:34:53 <Micen> I have a thing written already
13:35:44 <Micen> http://pastebin.com/Vq8KfHAr
13:36:14 <Micen> just kind of a rough thing. letting it sit for a bit before i commit to it
13:36:20 <DoT`> wtf micen please, mim going to look bad already
13:36:26 <DoT`> ]your making it worse
13:36:44 * Micen hangs head in shame.
13:36:57 <Micen> I can help!
13:37:26 <Phearlock> I kinda wanted to join but considering I kinda didn't get my footing either of the previous times I kinda just wanna sit this one out.
13:37:31 <Micen> here. if you need help with character building skip around this sheet until you come up with something. 
13:37:32 <Micen> http://pastebin.com/GSBcp3vN
13:38:06 <Phearlock> Also too many ponies and it gets a bit hard =D
13:38:50 <DoT`> im thinking of takign a shortsword or dagger or somethign, so i can do peircing damage if needed, they are monk weapons
13:39:11 <ZK> its not that bad DoT` and skram, starting the game you don't need to commit too much, your characters will grow oranically
13:39:47 <ZK> my chart has a staff and 4 daggers
13:39:52 <ZK> she likes taking daggers
13:40:06 <DoT`> but dont you summon a weapon?
13:40:17 <ZK> lvl 3, and im not doing that anymore
13:40:19 <DoT`> dagger pact and all
13:40:22 <DoT`> oh
13:40:23 <ZK> im going to get a pseudodragon instead
13:40:34 <ZK> cause which girl doesnt want a pet dragon?
13:40:57 <DoT`> :D
13:41:00 <Phearlock> So is that a regular lizard that flies or a regular lizard that has a breath attack? xD
13:41:08 <Phearlock> Since it's not really a dragon
13:41:31 <DoT`> i will try not to picture spike zk
13:41:41 <DoT`> :P
13:41:56 <ZK> lizard that flies with poison tail!
13:42:04 <Micen> ohh tail attack.
13:43:41 <Micen> oh dang i forgot, i start with 4 level 1 spells
13:44:03 <DoT`> The monk way of shadow has some nice things but its too edgy assassin for me >.>
13:46:28 <DoT`> Way of four elements is very avatar
13:48:13 <ZK> plz be magical micen
13:48:17 <ZK> i suck at all magical stuff
13:48:31 <ZK> and detect magic is kinda essential
13:48:40 <ZK> (arcana)
13:48:56 <Micen> Yeah 
13:49:01 <ZK> also, we need someone with decent perception. Or the game will kill us pretty quickly :P
13:49:15 <Micen> im going with Speak with Animals, Thunderwave, Comprehend Languages, and Detect magic
13:49:26 <Micen> i have a 13 in perception
13:49:41 <ZK> nothing to heal :o
13:50:12 <Micen> No way, I dont plan on taking damage. 
13:50:22 <ZK> i meant heal the rest of the club
13:51:18 <Micen> Im trying to take starter things that fit my story, and not be the min-maxer i usually am in these kinds of games
13:51:26 <ZK> ok sounds good
13:51:49 <ZK> which college you going to?
13:51:53 <DoT`> my perception is 3
13:51:56 <DoT`> so its ok
13:52:14 <DoT`> well 13
13:52:15 <Micen> Lore, due to background as storyteller
13:52:21 <DoT`> under skills it says 3
13:52:32 <DoT`> i have 5 i medicine
13:52:45 <DoT`> and can apparently make health potions somehow because hermit
13:52:56 <Micen> See, there we go
13:54:11 <ZK> what are your cantrips?
13:54:30 <Micen> Mine? Prestidigitation, message, and minor illusion
13:55:02 <ZK> oooh i also have minor illusion

19:27:45 <DoT`> cam, this roll20 sheet keeps reseting my AC to 12
19:27:55 <DoT`> any ideas?
19:28:00 <Camail> hmmm
19:28:08 <Camail> are you trying to directly change it
19:28:16 <Camail> is there an armor slot
19:28:23 <DoT`> yea, monk ac is 10+wis+dex
19:28:35 <DoT`> not that i see
19:28:43 <DoT`> are you looking at my sheet right now?
19:29:04 <Camail> I changed it to 16
19:29:06 <Camail> and it seems to stay
19:29:15 <Camail> when does it reset
19:29:18 <DoT`> it stays for a bit
19:29:36 <DoT`> it was changed this mornign and now when i go back
19:29:40 <DoT`> got*
19:29:56 <Camail> odd
19:30:31 <DoT`> i also wonder what having halfling luck ticked does
19:30:38 <DoT`> will it aouto reroll a 1?
19:31:46 <Camail> "Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll."
19:31:56 <Camail> "When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1."
19:32:11 <DoT`> yea, but what the tick box do?
19:32:31 <DoT`> in settings
19:35:15 <DoT`> im not having much luck finding it on the wiki

21:40:41 <Dot_> and cats
21:40:48 <skram> cats dont hurt people
21:40:49 <skram> get real
21:40:58 <Dot_> cats happly kill babies
21:41:03 <Dot_> by sitting on them
21:41:10 <Dot_> then will eat them if given a chance
21:41:21 <skram> a dog will eat you if you die too
21:41:29 <Runbunny> wait, dingos?
21:41:34 <Runbunny> really?
21:41:49 <Dot_> i didnt say it would not skram
21:42:00 <Dot_> but you claimed cats wouldnt hurt babies
21:42:14 <skram> sure
21:42:22 <skram> any poorly trained pet would hurt a baby dot
21:42:42 <Dot_> yes, so i stand by my statment
21:43:15 <skram> do you think anyone has ever been deaded by a cat
21:43:37 <Dot_> yes
