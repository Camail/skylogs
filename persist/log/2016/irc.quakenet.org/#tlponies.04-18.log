06:17:01 <motbob> i think my roommate is legitimately addicted to ice cream sandwiches
06:17:18 <motbob> he started buying them one 6-pack at a time
06:17:33 <motbob> then he started buying 3 6-packs, that was a bit alarming
06:17:41 <motbob> now it's up to 3 12-packs
06:17:53 <CockRoach|42> :o
06:17:54 <motbob> i think i need to stage an intervention
06:18:14 <CockRoach|42> eat them before he does
06:19:23 <motbob> that is another solution

17:33:50 <Phearlock> Not great obviously
17:34:15 <Cane> They work, which is the important thing. My Saitek/Madcatz gear keeps dying. That's part of why I eventually said fuck it and got Crosswinds.

17:36:54 <Cane> Hahah nice.
17:37:30 <Phearlock> Went 6-3, only 1 death from being shot down, the other was smashing into the ground due to overspeeding on the downhill vertical and losing control authority, and once to a mid-air colission while scissoring
17:38:16 <Cane> Oh my.
17:53:17 <Dotttt> hows the wrists cam?
17:55:17 <Camail> wrist isn't an issue, just the hand itself. but its ding better, trying not to use it lat much for a few days
17:55:29 <Camail> this usually happens if i play a non-cs fps or diablo3 for a week
17:56:02 <Camail> also wow the first game after playing bl2 was really weird
17:56:15 <Camail> I kept failing horribly during warm up
17:56:20 <Camail> felt so slow
17:57:35 <Dotttt> mine didnt go well
18:01:38 <Camail> it'll be even worse for you because your muscle memory isnt as baked in
18:01:46 <Camail> can't go back to a home that's never built
18:01:55 <Camail> rip life
18:02:00 <Camail> oh you also played overwatch

21:31:07 <Rawr|Fone> I am applying for schools now dot
21:32:34 <Dotttt> for what you learning rawr?
21:33:10 <Rawr|Fone> I am trying to get in to the game assembly
21:33:17 <Rawr|Fone> Which is game programming
21:33:21 <Dotttt> ah nice
21:33:30 <Rawr|Fone> Or newton, which is for web developers
21:33:57 <Rawr|Fone> And my third choice is a firefighter thing
21:34:35 <BioPhone> Punch the fire
21:36:08 <Rawr|Fone> I have heard you fight fire with fire
21:36:54 <Phearlock> Sometimes you can fight fire with explosions
21:38:52 <carcinisation> i don't expect sweden gets a lot of forest fires
21:40:17 <Rawr|Fone> We get them regularly down where I live
21:40:40 <CockRoach|42> because you start them?
21:40:45 <CockRoach|42> dun dun duuuun
21:41:56 <Rawr|Fone> Maybe D:
21:42:10 <CockRoach|42> :OOOOOO
21:43:57 <Cane> Wait WHAT THE FUCK.
21:44:14 <Cane> There's a Battlezone Redux?
21:45:08 <CockRoach|42> is that good?
21:45:15 <Cane> That
21:45:17 <Cane> is freaking great.
21:45:26 <CockRoach|42> :o
21:45:28 <Cane> It's a cult classic PC game from 1998.
21:45:44 <Cane> Runs like arse on modern computers, so if this is a new version of it that runs fine I am definitely getting this,.
21:46:12 <Cane> It's a niche game, cult classic because it mixes some weird genres.
21:46:19 <Dotttt> seems to be getting more populour atm to reowrk old games to run 
21:46:27 <Dotttt> blizzard just did it to BW and D2
21:46:34 <Cane> It has RTS elements where you can build a base, manage resources, you have a tech and upgrade tree, etc.
21:46:34 <CockRoach|42> i think i've actually played it
21:46:37 <Dotttt> and ive seen it a few other places
21:46:42 <Cane> And you can command your own AI units around.
21:46:44 <Cane> BUT you are also in the game.
21:46:52 <Cane> You're flying one of several hovertanks or aircraft.
21:47:02 <Cane> And you can just go all out first person hovertank shooter.
21:47:06 <Cane> And blow shit up.
21:47:23 <Cane> So the RTS elements are harder because you're doing them from first person, meaning it's more difficult to keep an eye on everything...
21:47:32 <Dotttt> so kind of a first person Supreme commander?
21:47:39 <Cane> And the FPS / tank elements are harder because you have to order units around to help you while you attack.
21:48:09 <Phearlock> I only vaguely remember battlezone
21:48:13 <Phearlock> But I remember it was cool
21:48:50 <Cane> The campaign plot is bonkers, but it's not what you're there for.
21:49:21 <Cane> Alternate universe where the cold war didn't end, but instead escalated the space race when we found weird artifacts and technology and minerals on planets around the solar system.
21:49:41 <Cane> So now the US and the USSR are fighting for control over the planets and moons in the solar system.
21:50:06 <Cane> And then they made a sequel called Battlezone 2, which introduced aliens and was generally kind of shit.
21:53:26 <Dotttt> hate when that happens :(

21:58:11 <Runbunny> O:
22:01:21 <Cane> Oh man. The DOOM trainwreck happened this weekend.
22:02:43 <Cane> Obviously, everybody adores the hell out of it for taking a beloved fast-paced PC shooter and turning it into a console port with sluggish controls, weapon loadouts, mandatory mouse acceleration, horribly upscaled texture resolution, garbage field of view, and few powerups.
22:03:29 <Camail> duh
22:03:36 <Golly> but it will still sell for single player and they wont learn a thing
22:03:40 <Camail> i for one cant wait to see the doomxfire emblem game
22:08:48 <Cane> Golly, I hate you because you're right.
22:11:41 <Golly> 2gd's game is going on kickstarter in a few weeks
22:12:21 <Golly> spiritual successor to quake, hopefully it does well
22:12:25 <ZK> mandatory mouse acceleration t.t That's a thing???
22:12:46 <Runbunny> it was in fallout 3 and NV if I recall.
22:15:17 <Camail> i imagine fan patches are a thing
22:15:20 <Camail> especially on pc
22:15:31 <Camail> but yea, hardware mouse esttings should be an option

23:34:55 <Camail> dot pls
23:35:45 <DoT`> blarg
23:39:58 <Raelcun> There's some level 1 pathfinder campaigns that are pretty stupid, archers that can oneshot characters because people make these premade campaigns with the express purpose of killing players
23:40:11 <Raelcun> Though you should totally play a meatgrinder campaign sometime it's super fun.
23:42:06 <Camail> I'm leaning more towards 5e, less hardcore optimal game-y, more loose
23:42:23 <Camail> especially for first time DMing/players
23:42:54 <Camail> but in general, there are a million videogames you can play like that, i have no interest in playing optimal in tabletop RPGs
23:43:34 <Camail> synergy and efficient characters sure, but anything remotely close to what whitewing would play, lolno
