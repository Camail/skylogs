19:14:30 <Runbunny> BUT

21:41:56 <Runbunny> Homeworld remastered edition.
21:42:01 <Phearlock> Yeah I played that.
21:42:02 <Runbunny> Is it something I need to get?

21:42:09 <Runbunny> You're my go to space guy.
21:42:17 <Phearlock> Did you ever play homeworld?

21:42:22 <Runbunny> well
21:42:35 <Runbunny> I tried but I was like 12 and had no idea what was going on.
21:42:52 <Phearlock> If you like slower paced RTS space games with very pretty visuals and great music/atmosphere in the SP campaign
21:42:55 <Phearlock> You should totally get it.
21:43:13 <Phearlock> Cause it's pretty much best-in-class at that combination.

23:09:37 <Camail> that's generally how it goes
23:09:54 <Camail> i wanted to play cs and didnt want to dm or MM, so i went into casuals

23:10:16 <Bio> 2strong
23:11:18 <Camail> went from 7v7 to 7v3, then i switched teams end it got down to 3v3
23:11:48 <Camail> also apparently loading screens take longer with fps_max 0
23:12:01 <Camail> 999 fps ont he loading screena ctually slows the loading down
23:12:02 <Camail> because valve
23:12:19 <Camail> fps_max 300 makes maps load in like 5 seconds for me, instead of 15
