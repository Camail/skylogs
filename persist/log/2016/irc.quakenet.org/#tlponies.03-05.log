04:24:54 <Camail> it would probably be more fun
04:24:58 <Camail> wellt he ppl playing the beta cared
04:25:03 <DuB`> Yeah.
04:25:05 <Camail> and you've sat out durig the first two weeks
04:25:11 <Camail> so everyone left at the bottom is balls
04:25:18 <Camail> little shriveled balls
04:25:27 <Camail> unloved and forgotten

04:28:01 <Camail> the reaosn juri is coming back
04:28:10 <Camail> is because everyone like the crazy bitch
04:28:28 <Camail> she's every casual players favorite new character in the last decade
04:28:58 <Camail> because they jack it when she does her ultra and pretends its them getting their spines crushed

13:41:34 <Runbunny> The cashiere at my local supermarket asked if I was going to drink today.
13:41:39 <Runbunny> He was like 16.
13:41:50 <skram> Did you invite him?
13:42:15 <Runbunny> Nah. I am not going drinking today.
13:42:26 <Runbunny> I have work tomorrow at 8 in the morning.
13:43:05 <skram> if you start now you might be almost sober for that
13:43:59 <Runbunny> you're right!
13:44:09 <Runbunny> Though I promised my mother that I would never drink alone.

13:53:28 <ZK> it was such a nice rivalry in WoL with stephano vs polt
13:53:30 <ZK> so much fun
13:54:08 <Yolteotl> yes, but Snute is not Stephano
13:54:11 <Yolteotl> skill wise
13:54:13 <ZK> hes not french
13:54:20 <ZK> so better :)
13:54:28 <ZK> but yea, stephano was something else
13:54:43 <ZK> nice crowd
13:56:26 <Yolteotl> France had 3ppl in ro16 ZK :P
13:56:35 <Yolteotl> and 5 in ro32
13:56:40 <Yolteotl> best foreign country
13:56:58 <ZK> well yea, at this point its not really disputable :/
13:57:10 <Yolteotl> let Marinelord some times
13:57:26 <Yolteotl> he is just a futur HUGE player if he doesn't stop
13:57:45 <Yolteotl> he can do some micro tricks than even Inno doesn't do :D
14:12:58 <Yolteotl> dot
14:13:11 <Yolteotl> remember I did a 11looose streak 2days ago?
14:13:29 <Yolteotl> now i'm sitting on 17-5 :D
14:13:37 <Yolteotl> (17wins)
14:13:47 <ZK> then how is that 11 lose streak?
14:13:58 <Yolteotl> I did 11 lose streak
14:14:06 <Yolteotl> then 17 - 5
14:14:10 <ZK> oooooooooohhhhhhh
14:14:25 <Yolteotl> with a 9win streak in it :P
14:14:49 <ZK> that tends to happen to me a lot. Whenever i go on huge losing streak, huge winning strike always follows
14:15:19 <Yolteotl> yes, it was thursday late evening, I just wanted to do some games, not able to win one
14:15:28 <Yolteotl> I just wanted to win one before sleeping :P
14:15:34 <Yolteotl> took me 2 hours

14:39:34 <Yolteotl> I mean, same players getting so much money without improving their skill at all
14:41:09 <ZK> yea, cause you really want to improve when theres no chance at winning any prize money which would let you survive the year
14:41:44 <Yolteotl> no one prevents foreigners to go to korea and use koreans structure to get better
14:42:00 <ZK> yea, cost of lifeand acceptance. Plus less money overall
14:42:02 <ZK> itd be dumb
14:42:15 <Yolteotl> Major asked to go to korea
14:42:19 <Yolteotl> and a team took him
14:42:25 <Yolteotl> for like one year
14:42:34 <ZK> and is not better than he was
14:42:50 <Yolteotl> just one of the best foreigner terran :P
