16:46:08 <DoT`> i could also go to the catacombs right at the start
16:51:12 <DoT`> lol this dragon thing
16:51:26 <DoT`> it just kept flying in the air as soon as it landed
16:51:41 <DoT`> and after about 3 minutes of that it landed on me
16:51:47 <DoT`> i think it glitched

21:21:11 <DoT`> you are very uncle
21:21:33 <skram> im just waiting for them to be old enough for lego technics
21:25:14 <reification> how many times are you uncle skram?
21:27:19 <skram> only twice
21:28:46 <reification> i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got time to catch up to me
21:29:04 <reification> how many siblings do you have?
21:29:22 <skram> 4
21:29:50 <reification> btw the combined plural for neices and nephews is niblings :D
21:30:05 <skram> thats adorable
21:31:30 <reification> i have 2 siblings 4 niblings so by that rate you should be aiming for 8x unclehood
21:33:13 <skram> As long as I dont have to change diapers
21:34:36 <reification> the idea of being uncle is all the fun bits without the responsibility :p
21:34:53 <skram> exactly
21:37:45 <Rawr|Fone> I'm allergic to responsibility
21:38:01 <Phearlock> That's not true Rawr, you can take care of dogs
21:38:11 <Phearlock> If you were turly allergic to responsibilty, you'd have cats.
21:38:23 <Rawr|Fone> They are the ones taking care of me!

21:53:54 <Phearlock> I don't think that animation works quite as well as it should. As when I saw it I assumed the wings were flapping.
21:53:57 <DoT`> haha
21:54:05 <Phearlock> That last one was pretty great haha
21:54:11 <reification> you reminded me i had extra hotel cookies saved. good job dotties
21:54:27 <reification> i shall have cocoa to go with them
21:56:55 <skram> I dont think I would stab anyone for a jaffa cake dot
21:57:22 <DoT`> D:
21:57:24 <DoT`> heathen
21:57:51 <CockRoach|42> but you should!
21:58:02 <skram> i dont think you are a good influence
21:58:39 <CockRoach|42> :(
21:58:47 <Phearlock> I love jaffa cakes but, I can't eat as many jaffa cakes if I am in prison
21:58:57 <Phearlock> I think long-term jaffa cake aquistion.
22:00:08 <skram> very wise ferlok
22:00:27 <reification> low time preference is a big indicator of success in life phear
22:00:41 <skram> Actually I do think you can get as many jaffa cakes you want in prison though
22:00:51 <skram> I will have to ask my friends
22:01:01 <Phearlock> Yeah I just assumed
22:01:18 <Phearlock> I would appreciate your assistance in confirming the theory skram
22:01:31 <skram> im not going to prison for you
22:01:41 <Phearlock> =/
22:01:43 <Phearlock> But it's for science.
22:02:18 <skram> Ill ask my adopted big bro what the jaffa cake situation was like when he was in there
