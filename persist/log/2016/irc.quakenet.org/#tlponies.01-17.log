10:08:14 <Dot_> its only downhill from thewre angel
10:08:56 <Runbunny> Nah
10:09:49 <Runbunny> Actually. my problem consists of somewhere along the lines of gameplay and inputs something fucks up.
10:10:36 <Runbunny> essentially my computer wont handle me pressing s + d + space.
10:10:47 <Runbunny> then it just eats the space input.
10:10:59 <Runbunny> Which is mildy annoying.

16:45:01 <zkay> 90.7 kg
16:46:26 <DoT`> zk, your like 7 feet tall, isnt it ok to be 90 kg then
16:47:15 <zkay> im only 190 cm, but ill say the weight is muscle so im not overweight
16:47:25 <zkay> gogo snute
16:48:42 <DoT`> yea, im always confused by that, muscle weighs more than fat, so just weight is a bad judge
16:49:18 <Golly> "only 190"

22:40:51 <Rawr|Fone> You can easily do that dub
22:40:58 <Rawr|Fone> I am sleep though
22:41:01 <Rawr|Fone> Nnnnnnnnnnn
22:41:09 <DuB`> G'night rawr!
22:41:14 <zkay> you watchin mvp vs squirtle DuB`?
22:41:18 <zkay> it was such a fun game
22:43:55 <DuB`> Yeah!
22:44:56 <zkay> this wasnt the game i thought
22:46:05 <zkay> hey PengWin, how do you usually play ZvT? Roach ravager? Early all-in? Ling bling muta into quick ultras?
22:46:14 <PengWin> lose
22:46:20 <PengWin> terran is gigantically overpowered in tvz atm
22:46:25 <PengWin> you have to all in or you realistically wont win
22:46:26 <DuB`> No mutmuts pls.
22:46:34 <PengWin> unless they're shit
22:46:40 <PengWin> if you want to rely on them being shit
22:46:42 <PengWin> muta ling bane 
22:46:43 <PengWin> into ultras
22:46:57 <PengWin> technically muta ling bane is the best macro style but if you lose 3 mutas the game is over
22:47:01 <zkay> okie, im diamond so opponents are shit like me :D
22:47:02 <PengWin> so half the koreans dont even try to play it
22:47:33 <zkay> roach ravager corrupter?
22:47:37 <PengWin> no
22:47:42 <PengWin> roach ravager infestor works on small maps
22:47:46 <PengWin> but all ins do too
22:47:49 <PengWin> so you should just do that
22:48:05 <zkay> which all-ins? Before or after lair tech?
22:48:12 <PengWin> before
22:48:12 <PengWin> lol
22:48:13 <PengWin> like
22:48:15 <PengWin> 4 minute all ins
22:48:19 <PengWin> roach ling ravager ling roach ravager
22:48:25 <zkay> no banes?
22:48:51 <PengWin> no
22:48:54 <PengWin> banes are shit at all ins
22:48:56 <PengWin> everybody opens tanks
22:52:56 <DuB`> Z>P P>T T>Z ??
