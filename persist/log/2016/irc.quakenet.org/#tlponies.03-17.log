00:04:58 <reification> night all
00:05:28 <DoT`> gnght reif!
00:10:53 <Camail> so i wore a 2-week pair of contacts for 2 months, taking a 2 day break to let my eyes remember how to moisturize.
00:11:02 <Camail> which actually works, luckily
00:14:45 <Camail> omg
00:15:10 <Camail> i was wondering why stardew felt faster, is it because I put it on ssd?
00:17:49 <Camail> .tell micen so every single stardew copy uses the same file location for saves, so if you ever do buy it, it's a completely painless transition
00:20:58 <DoT`> Dob dib dub

01:07:24 <Camail> DoT`  if you get on the bus at 1:20 you can make it straight to bed
01:08:08 <Camail> so popping a stairway down on the ground at 1:10 and then climbing back up to the top is the most optimal timing

13:06:00 <Crisium> buy some blueberries
13:06:21 <Crisium> animals are lower income and take a lot longer to turn a profit, so focusing on crops first is best
13:06:35 <Crisium> i got chickens in late summer, cows in early fall
13:06:48 <Crisium> currently mid fall
13:08:14 <Runbunny> but i need to get my crab pots ready in time for winter!
13:08:29 <Crisium> ur a crab pot
13:08:38 <Crisium> i never bothered to use those
13:09:14 <Crisium> i was able to complete the crab bundle just with crabs from the mines (an enemy you kill has a chance to drop) and foraging off the beach
13:09:57 <Crisium> paying 300 wood for the beach bridge on the right is a good idea btw, some decent forage there
13:11:06 <Rawr|Fone> I forgot my book
13:11:17 <Rawr|Fone> What should I do for 50 minutes

17:14:47 <DuT`> irl getting in the way of my happy farm!
17:14:53 <DuT`> ruining it
17:15:51 <Camail> have you considered starting a farm irl
17:17:03 <DuT`> with puppies on
17:17:04 <DuT`> yes
17:26:21 <DuT`> you enjoy living with a gerbal cam?
17:26:27 <DuT`> or hamster, or whatever it is
17:33:06 <Camail> dot my first starfruit crop came in
17:33:14 <DuT`> all the richs
17:33:16 <Camail> the golds alone yielded 150k
17:33:30 <Camail> preserving the other ones
17:33:38 <DuT`> how many you plant?
17:33:42 <Camail> i needed to money to rebuy tho so i had to sell to pierre on the day
17:33:49 <Camail> ummm 8*24
17:33:56 <Camail> gonna plant 14*24 this time
17:34:07 <DuT`> where you get the seeds? does pierre sell the,?
17:34:13 <Camail> .python 12 * 24
17:34:25 <Camail> no, the desert
17:34:33 <DuT`> oh
17:34:41 <Camail> i just needed to sell the fruit on the day instead of putting it in the box
17:34:52 <Camail> .python 14 * 24
17:35:53 <DuT`> wooow penny, hates dwarvish scrolls
17:35:54 <Camail> gonna spend 134k on seeds this time
17:35:57 <DuT`> weird
17:35:59 <Camail> racist!
17:36:18 <Camail> why would you giv her a scroll
17:36:24 <DuT`> i had one on me
17:36:27 <Camail> ...
17:36:27 <DuT`> haha
17:36:30 <Camail> ...
17:36:34 <Camail> THIS IF FUTURE WIFE
17:36:36 <Camail> oh wait
17:36:38 <Camail> no thats leah
17:36:42 <Camail> but still
17:36:44 <DuT`> to my mind with all her book reading it would at worst be nuetral
17:36:48 <Camail> she already feels like garbage
17:37:01 <Camail> for being passed up on the one new guy who isn't a shitbag
17:37:17 <Camail> dot its probably because its an artifact
17:37:24 <Camail> adventuring items are usually not liked by anyone
17:37:33 <DuT`> yea :/  and worth 1 gold
17:37:39 <Camail> resources and artifacts are disliked
17:37:47 <Camail> give it to the dwarf
17:38:00 <DuT`> im sure he didnt like it
17:38:09 <Camail> how do you know
17:38:09 <DuT`> he loves rubys
17:38:18 <DuT`> and i have a lot of them
17:38:43 <Camail> oh, so you give the dwarf gems but you give penny a piece of paper you found in your pocket that you don't feel like throwing away
17:38:45 <Camail> ok, cool
17:38:53 <DuT`> pretty much
17:38:57 <Camail> what a dick
17:39:05 <DuT`> i blame pam
17:39:38 <Camail> i want to start a fresh game and see if i can parsnip my way to the desert in the summer and get star fruit
17:39:55 <Camail> not sure if its possible
17:40:09 <DuT`> hmmm 45 k needed
17:40:13 <Camail> probably have to forage and fish to suppliment the initial cost
17:40:22 <Camail> 45k needed to GET there
17:40:30 <DuT`> eparsnip sells for 35
17:40:31 <Camail> hmmm
17:40:38 <DuT`> and costs 10?
17:40:40 <Camail> not sure if it would even be a viable strat for year one
17:40:52 <DuT`> so 25 profit
17:41:09 <Camail> parsnips cost 20
17:41:15 <DuT`> oh, 15 profit
17:41:27 <DuT`> 5 days to grow including planting day
17:41:33 <DuT`> so you get 5 harvests
17:41:45 <Camail> never include planting day
17:41:53 <Camail> because you harvest and plant ont he same day
17:41:58 <DuT`> ah yes
17:42:19 <DuT`> 6 harvests
17:42:39 <DuT`> 500 parsnips a harvest!
17:42:47 <DuT`> gg
17:43:04 <Camail> ok so you start out with 500g and 9 parsnips?
17:43:10 <Camail> how many do you start with
17:43:11 <DuT`> is it 45 k?  25 10 2,5 
17:43:12 <Camail> i cant remember
17:43:33 <Crisium> 47.5K to get bus fixed
17:43:40 <Crisium> i looked at at recently to lament that im poor
17:43:53 <Camail> whats more important is how many parsnips you start with
17:43:56 <Crisium> er 42.5
17:44:29 <Camail> bleh, ear one starfruit isnt viable
17:44:40 <Camail> y*
17:45:11 <Camail> even if you can afford it, normal crops have better ROI because farm space isnt as valuable at the beginning
17:53:55 <Camail> I made a 80k mistake, at least...
17:54:00 <Camail> forgot to by fertilizer
17:54:15 <Camail> save scum time

18:57:27 <Rawr|Phone> Like 3%
19:00:50 <DoT|Phone> seventy percent corgi
19:10:35 <Crisium> are animals randomly upset sometimes?
19:10:44 <Crisium> or are they somehow not reaching my grass
19:10:49 <Camail> that, probably
19:10:59 <Camail> i havent seen them sad for no reason
19:11:02 <Crisium> like 1 or 2 random animals are mad even tho i let them outside and pet them
19:11:10 <Camail> yea, they just didnt eat
19:11:15 <Camail> set out hay just in case
19:11:44 <Crisium> good idea
19:19:28 <DoT|Phone> you got a pony yet crisium
19:19:32 <Crisium> neigh
19:19:34 <Crisium> too expensive
19:19:39 <Crisium> maybe in the winter
19:23:09 <Camail> so much ahrdwood for a stable
19:23:26 <Camail> i added 3 rooms to my house for just a bit more than that

19:24:20 <Crisium> have to farm secret woods for weeks
19:26:42 <Camail> well
19:26:45 <Camail> 9 days
19:27:00 <Crisium> it 100% respawns overnight?
19:27:06 <Camail> yes
19:30:13 <Camail> so close
19:30:16 <Camail> to being done with bundles
19:30:21 <Camail> bulletin is all i have left
19:30:28 <Camail> duck feather and tree fruits...
19:30:36 <Camail> praying to the gypsy gods
19:30:52 <Crisium> i messed up ignoring those
19:30:57 <Crisium> theres ones i will need summer again for
19:31:10 <Crisium> finally got the mine cart tho, which is convenient
19:31:57 <Camail> you only do it year 1 if you know about every bundle at the beginning
19:32:06 <Camail> its not designed to be done int he first year
19:33:26 <Camail> I'm gonna be finishing in this fall because i didnt plant fruit trees year 1
19:33:37 <Crisium> oh ya that too lol

19:47:52 <Crisium> she is based
19:56:00 <Camail> dot did you do the thing with the gravestone yet
19:57:56 <DuT`> nom i tried holding a few things in the triangle with no result
19:58:00 <DuT`> no*
19:58:31 <DuT`> i clearly dont have what i need yet
19:58:38 <DuT`> whatever it is
20:00:15 <Camail> "A rainbow forged from land, not sea"
20:00:32 <Camail> what's your guess
20:01:15 <DuT`> i focused on the skies part and tried irridium and star fruit, wasnt very hopeful with the fruit
20:01:30 <DuT`> a gem maybe
20:01:35 <Phearlock> A prism of some sort
20:01:42 <DuT`> therefore bottom of the skull cavern
20:01:44 <Phearlock> I don't play game, but that sounds like what it'd be
20:01:48 <Camail> whats the only thing in the game that looks like a rainbow
20:02:15 <DuT`> nothing springs to mind
20:02:18 <Camail> k
20:02:33 <Camail> It's entirely possible you havent even gotten one yet
20:02:36 <Camail> but I'd be surprised
20:02:37 <DuT`> as I saidm havnt foud the thing yet
20:02:44 <DuT`> the game isnt amazingly subtle
20:02:53 <DuT`> im pretty sure i will know when i see it
20:03:24 <Camail> nbd, I just assume you had one, i got one really early so i asusmed you had one by now
20:03:34 <Camail> but its all rng i guess
20:07:53 <DuT`> i still havnt found that basket
20:08:19 <Crisium> its an an area i didnt even know existed
20:08:26 <Crisium> i looked it up
20:19:26 <Camail> dot know about that area
20:20:55 <DuT`> ive gone through that forest under trees wonderign blind clicking and not found it
20:21:08 <DuT`> i should probably just look  online
20:21:15 <DuT`> ive clearly missed something obvoius
20:24:17 <DuT`> i forgot this area existed.... i havnt been there since the game started
20:32:07 <DuT`> skram, hows your farm
20:33:16 <Camail> someone was editting the crops wiki and made a terrible mistake
20:33:21 <Camail> with formatting...somehow
20:35:05 <skram> i have no idea what im doing
20:35:06 <Camail> oh i tihnk i found the end game crop
20:35:20 <Camail> skram just put it in
20:35:24 <Camail> whatever it is, just put it in the thing
20:35:27 <Crisium> lol
20:35:51 * skram jams some parsnips into cams ass
20:35:57 <Crisium> Cauliflower, Potato are good profit in spring
20:36:02 <Crisium> then grow parsnip for bribes
20:37:41 <DuT`> cam, i was going to fill greenhouse with ancient fruit, thats my current plan
20:37:50 <DuT`> though  i dont have the greenhouse yet
20:39:51 <Camail> rare seeds might be better
20:39:55 <Camail> need to test
20:40:09 <Camail> especially because its easier to get 144 rare seeds
20:40:10 <DuT`> they are once off though
20:40:16 <Camail> so?
20:40:28 <DuT`> 28 days to grow i think
20:40:38 <DuT`> ancient every 8 days about
20:40:54 <Camail> for me its different because of the perk
20:41:01 <Camail> and the profit margin is way higher on rare seeds
20:41:16 <Camail> which makes them jelly even better
20:41:26 <DuT`> will need to test, and try by turning both into jelly
20:41:32 <Camail> the jelly is worth 6k each
20:41:58 <Camail> so thats 9k for you
20:42:24 <Camail> thats 1.3 million a season
20:42:30 <Camail> a little less
20:42:34 <Camail> because of sprinklers
20:42:46 <DuT`> lol
20:43:16 <Camail> also you wont be able to get 144 ancient seeds for awhile
20:43:24 <Camail> i guess you can start now
20:43:47 <Camail> you could even offset the cost of rare seeds by putting them in the seed maker
20:44:01 <DuT`> i have 7 ancient so far
20:44:01 <Camail> which wouldnt be worth it
20:44:05 <Camail> now that I'm thinking about it
20:44:36 <Camail> so thats 3-4 weeks of optimal seed making to get to 144
20:44:41 <Camail> probably 4
20:46:04 <Camail> for you, it appears the come out roughly the same
20:46:48 <Camail> assuming you have 144/3 preserves jars to keep up with the output
20:47:02 <DuT`> lol
20:47:09 <Camail> so 48
20:47:31 <DuT`> got 10 so far
20:47:32 <Camail> rare seeds only need 144/14
20:47:59 <Camail> so 11
20:51:02 <Camail> you could do wine, i guess
20:51:10 <Camail> oh wait no thats even worse
20:51:24 <Camail> you would need 144 kegs for that
20:51:31 <DuT`> lol
20:51:47 <DuT`> BioClass home please
20:51:50 <Camail> .r rare planted 13th of spring
20:52:05 <Crisium> how do i get hay from the silo? i feel stupid
20:52:08 <Crisium> it says it has a lot
20:52:11 <Crisium> but i cant grab it
20:52:22 <DuT`> from the dispenser in the coop/barn
20:52:48 <Crisium> oh thats convenient
20:52:51 <Crisium> i dont have to make a trip to silo
20:53:30 <Camail> .r rare + | normal harvest is fall 9
20:56:55 <Camail> ok you can put sprinklers outside the greenhouse soil
20:58:07 <Camail> so you can water the outside with a lot of normal spinrklers, then put 4 iridium sprinklers in the middle
20:58:18 <Camail> so you can get 140 crops growing all year round
20:59:12 <Camail> holy shit
20:59:21 <Camail> Money gave birth
20:59:25 <Camail> I have only one pig
20:59:31 <Camail> We all know what I have to name this pig
20:59:43 <Camail> Money, meet your new daughter, Jesus
21:00:59 <Camail> Crisium sorry i just sold you
21:01:12 <Camail> next time uhhh...dont be a normal chicken i guess
21:01:14 <Crisium> we wanted a kinder master
