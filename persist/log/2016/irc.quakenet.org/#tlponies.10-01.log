07:15:57 <Rawr|Fone> So that's good
07:16:06 <motbob> half blind though (for now)
07:16:23 <Micen> just wait until it heals and you have much better sight.

07:44:25 <CockRoach|42> morning pons
07:45:40 <motbob> dunno. full healing seems to ake 3-6 months but 50% of the healing happens in the first day, 25% of the healing happens in the first 5 days, 12.5% in the first month, etc...
07:46:24 <motbob> healing seems to differ greatly between people. They said that because I am young I will probably be ahead of schedule
