01:43:26 <Camail> lol
01:43:38 <Camail> I would never let anyone elses shit touch my computer no matter what
01:43:43 <Camail> especially an old person's thing
01:43:55 <DoT`> it was the most stubborn virus i have come across
01:43:55 <Camail> dont trust them
01:44:07 <Camail> did you have to reformat

01:51:31 <Bio> I feel like my dad just came home after abandoning our family, kissed my mom, slapped her, then took the dog and left.
01:52:21 <Camail> not gonna lie, its not a pissing contest. Gabe can just whip his dick out in public and piss on james
01:52:27 <Camail> and noone can do anything about it
01:53:16 <DoT`> i see james reply there
01:53:17 <Cane> So I caught glimpses of the Dota 2 drama yesterday when it was happening (because it was the #1, #2, #3, and #8 posts on r/all)
01:53:47 <Cane> And I said to myself, "have fun with that, gonna go sleep, when this blows over someone will write a summary I can look up".
01:54:06 <Cane> I wasn't expecting the summary to be "James is an ass", but thanks I guess Gabe.
01:54:27 <DoT`> but its also fun sometimes just looking in as it unfolds and seeing glimpses
01:56:13 <DuB`> C'mon violet!
02:02:30 <DoT`> bleh, everything still seems to say avira for best antivirus
02:02:39 <DoT`> except one that claimed nortan HAHA

15:42:31 <DoT`> whats with this troll!
15:42:41 <Bio> The only small problem I saw while there after talking with others was... no one was getting paid….. Only me? I’m like wtf… So you're paying me because I’m not involved in dota 2. but your dota 2 casters are not getting paid. Owning my own agency and working with countless talent over the years. This for me is a big no no. And i'm a problem solver, I don't shy away from trying to help 
15:42:41 <Bio> even If i am the ‘annoying guy’ you have to deal with. So, I start conversations with Valve during the evening over drinks.
15:43:28 <Bio> including these problems we do not get paid for our time as hosts only signatures… 
15:43:28 <Bio> Remember those? Well basically our pay was 0. but we got money every time someone would buy an item and add our ingame signature. So if you added my signature for a dollar. I think I got 50c or the whole dollar. I cannot remember. So valve turned the talent into signature salesmen and women.
15:43:37 <Bio> jeeeeeeeeeesus
15:43:43 <DoT`> I saw redeye talking about starting some form of union for esports
15:43:51 <Bio> valve tried to crowd fund talent salaries for ti4

16:38:02 <Phant> omg he got called an ass by GabeN
16:38:10 <Phant> Good job Gabe
16:39:10 <Bio> now read 2gd's side
16:41:39 <Phant> This thing is riddled with typos.
16:42:07 <Bio> its pretty raw, yeah
16:45:54 <Phant> wow at this first joke
16:46:02 <Phant> no wonder he got fired
16:46:16 <DoT`> im waiting on bio's tl dr of the 17 pages
16:46:55 <Bio> theres a summary at the end dot

16:48:34 <Pearlock> See now the casters are all scared and the panel is a bit like 2GD's funeral.
16:48:45 <Pearlock> So, probably not the best way to go about it haha
16:48:46 <Bio> yes phant, its not a thesis, but the man was just fired, told to ice his comments on the situation, then wakes up to gabe calling him an ass
16:48:53 <Pearlock> But sure blame 2GD.
16:49:23 <Bio> oh, and his best friend fired him in between shots over an email from gabe half a world away
16:49:34 <Bio> sucks all around
16:50:00 <CockRoach|42> http://scarlet-spectrum.deviantart.com/art/Socks-how-do-they-work-591674103
16:50:14 <Pearlock> Yeah I don't disagree about 2GD being an ass but, this seems like it was piss-poor handling by Valve
16:50:15 <Phant> I don't have any sympathy for 2GD on this one.
16:50:29 <Phant> He goes off a comment in ap rivate conversation
16:50:42 <Pearlock> You should have some sympathy for the other staff though Phant

16:58:51 <Phant> They keep bringing up that point that Icefrog told him to be himself.
16:58:56 <Phant> Which I think is pretty invalid.

16:59:30 -!- Yolteotl [webchat@253.73.126.78.rev.sfr.net] has joined #tlponies
16:59:32 <Bio> he's essentially lead game designer
16:59:39 <Phant> probably not involved too heavily in the production of the event.
16:59:44 <Phant> And it was a private conversation.
17:00:04 <Phant> and probably wasn't talked about with other members of the production crew.
17:00:24 <Bio> well, valve obviously doesn't have any conversations internally
17:00:44 <Bio> most of this crap is just a bad game of telephone
17:01:09 <Bio> but idk, i'd consider icefrog a fairly important member of vovlo
17:01:27 <Bio> should james make that joke? nah, even he said it was probably much
17:01:50 <Bio> but man, gabe can't just shitpost like that
17:02:01 <Phant> Of course he can.
17:02:08 <Bio> no, he really can't
17:02:25 <Bio> he did, but it wasn't right
17:02:28 <Phant> If I was the CEO of a company, and saw this guy come up and start hosting, I would have doen the exact same thing.
17:03:13 <Bio> right, but THEY hired him, and was told by icefrog to be 2gd
17:03:22 <Bio> someone who's not unimportant
17:03:32 <Phant> Icefrog told him in an unofficial private conversation to be himself.
17:03:38 <Phant> that is meaningless
17:03:41 <DuB`> I feel like when you hire 2gd you know who 2gd IS. >.>
17:03:47 <Bio> if they wanted him to be ESPN, why not tell the valve reps at the major to pull him aside and tell him to tone it down
17:03:56 <Bio> he's obviously capable of it: See TI4
17:04:25 <Bio> but they just throw a grenade at the whole major
17:04:27 <Phant> After the first jopke, they DID tell him to turn it down.
17:04:32 <Phant> in his own statement
17:04:43 <Bio> right
17:04:50 <Bio> and he did
17:05:10 <Bio> then he did pretty timid banter about his old buddies sing/waga
17:05:23 <Phant> I wouldn't call it timid
17:05:27 <Bio> which is the exact same thing happening on the csgo majors btw
17:05:30 <Pearlock> That's a thing valve does need to work on yeah, other than the CEO, no one at valve really comes across as being in charge of organizing this.
17:05:36 <Pearlock> Who do you listen to?
17:05:48 <Bio> yeah
17:06:01 <Bio> then this stuff comes out about salaries for talent
17:06:15 <Bio> did you see the shady shit they tried to pull with the signatures?
17:06:20 <Pearlock> yes
17:06:47 <DoT`> http://howxu.deviantart.com/art/Weekly-art-53-Do-you-even-science-593368307
17:07:23 <Bio> the point people are making is that Thorin and Lewis ( who actually got into a PHYSICAL altercation at an event) are still in charge of panels, and do the same banter and jabs at players that 2gd does.
17:07:26 <DoT`> http://www.deviantart.com/art/Nice-Day-For-A-Picnic-C-592751686
17:08:00 <Pearlock> Wait what? lewis is still allowed to be near esports events?
17:08:03 <Bio> and its just  unreal that gabe needs to insult someone after firing them
17:08:14 <Bio> yeah, he's on stream for MLG right now
17:08:15 <Pearlock> I missed that and that's fucking rediciulous.
17:08:16 <Bio> both
17:08:39 <Pearlock> You can't physically attack a player at an event
17:08:55 <Pearlock> Like, no, get the fuck out and don't come back
17:09:32 <Bio> whats even better was they made a joke about it yesterday on stream. where's gabe on this?
17:09:41 <Bio> its just unreal
17:10:09 <Bio> People expected that he was shouting racial slurs, attacking people and destroying shit for gabe to descend from volvo and post what he did
17:10:25 <Bio> but man
17:10:38 <Bio> Its going to be interesting the next couple of days
17:10:46 <Phant> It seems the whole panel of hosts for these events need to be thrown out.
17:10:53 <Phant> Pretty embarassing.
17:10:54 <Bio> Though I fully expect Valve to clam up like they do

18:09:20 <DuB`> You try to dribble on carpet!
18:13:46 <DuB`> Hmmmm.
18:13:59 <DuB`> I reeally want to pokemon. I haven't played one since Emerald.
18:14:05 <DuB`> Gotta get a 3ds...
18:14:27 <Pearlock> there's some emulators n shit
18:14:44 <Pearlock> And some decent fanmade pokemon games too
18:15:08 <Pearlock> (well, maybe not 3DS ones, but tons of DS ones)
18:16:17 <DuB`> The only time I ever got a virus on a computer was from downloading randome pokemon emulator on the family PC when I was like 12. :P
18:16:21 <DuB`> NEVER TRUST AGAIN.
18:17:18 <DoT|Phone1> silly pon. be a better pirate
18:17:31 <Pearlock> The virus only triggers if it detects underage people who are too young for pokemon.
18:17:35 <Pearlock> You should be fine now.
18:18:11 <Crisium> Pokey Mans
18:18:12 <DuB`> Eh.
18:18:28 <DuB`> Half the reason I want to is because I have a ton of empty time on campus between classes.
18:18:36 <DuB`> Would be nice to have a ds.
18:18:49 <Crisium> phone emulators
18:19:00 <Crisium> easily emulate gameboy and gba
18:19:10 <Crisium> there is a good DS emulator but it costs like $7
18:19:55 <Crisium> i think you are smarter then when you were 12 and can get a rom without a virus
18:20:00 <Crisium> *hope
18:20:02 <Crisium> :P
18:21:09 <DuB`> I dunno, mang.
18:21:17 <DuB`> I haven't taken to the high seas in quite some time.

18:52:04 <reification> final sudoku round was stopped due to our italian guest having a seizure :(

19:50:47 <Runbunny> Do you even have any passion?
19:50:50 <Crisium> forgot
19:50:52 <Crisium> puting it on now
19:51:00 <Runbunny> nah it's too late now.
20:01:12 <Crisium> take the poison
20:04:28 <Runbunny> Why is like 4 out of 6 buttons safe?
20:04:43 <Runbunny> Damned seagull. 
20:04:50 <Crisium> Fang?
20:04:52 <Runbunny> Yeh.
20:04:53 <Crisium> because he doesnt have a real overhead
20:05:01 <Crisium> so he needs to pressure with buttons
20:05:02 <Runbunny> Fang is totally a seagull.
20:05:24 <Crisium> same with bison - neither have a command throw or overhead so they need a ton of safe buttons
20:05:43 <Crisium> if you block the only fear is chip damage / poison or a throw
