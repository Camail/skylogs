00:14:44 <Camail> this combo doesnt do THAT much more damage, but it starts from her bnb block string
00:14:46 <Camail> so i dunno
00:14:50 <Camail> i guess i should elarn it

00:25:07 <Camail> Crisium  also its good to know that the AI still sucks
00:25:11 <Camail> after all these years
00:25:14 <Crisium> lol
00:25:22 <Camail> its either painfully eay
00:25:25 <Camail> or jsut reading inputs
00:25:28 <Camail> like usual
00:25:31 <Crisium> yup
00:25:50 <Camail> thats the next thing thats gonna make fighting games big for casuals
00:26:01 <Camail> good single player needs real ai
00:26:03 <Camail> well
00:26:06 <Camail> nvm casuals suck too much
00:26:16 <Camail> literally cant tell ai from a player
00:26:34 <Crisium> tru
00:26:39 <Camail> well it would make single player fun for actual players
00:27:01 <Camail> fighting games are the only genre where i really feel casuals arent actually playing the real game
00:27:31 <Camail> but the ai is so ass
00:31:07 <Camail> i can do the combo with lk sbk more than mk
00:31:15 <Camail> oddly enough
00:32:08 <Crisium> thats the one i did it with
00:34:24 <motbob> the street fighter subreddit is way more popular than /r/kappa. when did this happen.
00:42:16 <Camail> r kappa is an actually bad place
00:42:33 <Camail> like back alley kinda bad
00:42:36 <Camail> so people left
00:42:55 <Camail> also i assume new people are joining
00:43:10 <Camail> and /r/sf seems like a solid palce to start

02:38:27 <Crisium> story takes like 3 mins
02:38:36 <Crisium> its only 4 fights and some cutscenes
02:39:20 <Camail> ?
02:39:23 <Camail> you dont get story cosumes froms troy
02:39:26 <Camail> story*
02:39:34 <Camail> you get them from zeny
02:39:37 <Camail> 40k
02:39:47 <Crisium> you need to beat the story to be eligable to buy them
02:40:10 <Camail> well yea
02:40:15 <Camail> but you still cant use them
02:40:21 <Camail> unless you buy them with fight money
02:40:42 <Camail> dlc costumes are $4 and characters are $6
02:40:56 <Camail> i dunno why costumes cost so much, unless its a costume pack
02:41:03 <Camail> hopefully is the full pack
02:41:32 <Crisium> its just one i think
02:41:44 <Crisium> id only get one for a character i play anyway
02:42:06 <Crisium> ill save the fight money for the 6 characters though
02:42:24 <Crisium> single player gives a lot early on, then i guess its the gradual climb
02:42:53 <Camail> single player can give you enough for one dlc character
02:43:51 <Camail> guess they make their money on costumes
02:43:56 <Crisium> more than that if you include survivor
02:44:13 <Crisium> iv done 2 storys and 3 suvivors and have 60k
02:44:15 <Camail> you'll never get more than 2 from single player
02:44:47 <Crisium> not sure what the exact math, but probably
02:44:48 <Camail> a lot of that is from levels
02:44:53 <Camail> you get 1k per level
02:44:57 <Camail> for each character
02:45:10 <Crisium> easy fast money at first
02:45:13 <Camail> i read a math thing before, maybe they were really wrong
02:46:27 <Crisium> i just know i wont buy a costume until i get 600,000
02:46:35 <Crisium> then again theres always season 2

05:09:34 <Camail> delayed teching is gonna be really big in this game after 2 months
05:09:41 <Camail> because built in frame traps are so easy
05:10:57 <Crisium> moves have much fewer plus frames this time around
05:11:04 <Crisium> i think a lot of ppl dont have true block strings
05:11:15 <Crisium> a lot of them i mean
05:11:46 <Crisium> getting a lone of online matches right now

05:48:53 <Camail> you saw it
05:48:57 <Camail> in crackfiend combo
05:49:15 <Camail> if you do it at the lowest possible height you can link into jab

06:23:48 <Crisium> that last QCF+MK is coming out as QCF+MP and im changing claw again lol
06:27:07 <Camail> stop that
06:28:07 <Crisium> k
06:31:02 <Camail> man
06:31:25 <Camail> it seems like everyones normals are -1, specials are -5, and ex's are -2
06:31:41 <Camail> it just feels like everyone has the same general safe thing
06:31:52 <Camail> some ex's are + i guess
06:32:10 <Crisium> i just notice the normals have a LOT less plus frames
06:32:15 <Camail> on hit yea
06:32:20 <Camail> but on block everything is safe
06:32:26 <Crisium> yes
06:32:45 <Camail> other than sweeps
06:33:22 <Camail> but yea, in roder tor educe combo potential a lot of things have like no = frames
06:33:40 <Camail> especially because you can buffer normals so they can get away with making primary combo moves +3

06:58:32 <Crisium> i showed him the pic before

06:58:58 <Crisium> i like this
07:02:35 <Crisium> and blown up by the first necalli i fought
07:17:58 <Crisium> ah my win results didnt count, dc
07:18:18 <Crisium> well guess ill stop while the winning is good
07:19:35 <Crisium> top 12 players in LP right now is 11 unique characters, the balance
07:34:34 <Camail> welp
07:34:40 <Camail> this game doesnt like my internet connection
07:34:54 <Camail> i dont think I'm gonna be playing it much for the forseeable future
07:35:47 <Crisium> try 5 only?
07:35:51 <Camail> did
07:35:54 <Camail> pc only as well
07:35:56 <Camail> its my connection
07:35:59 <Crisium> bummer
07:36:04 <Camail> its not stable enough for this rollback netcode
07:36:33 <Camail> i still need to finish all the single palyer stuff anyway
07:36:47 <Camail> and get that chun combo down to bnb status
07:37:25 <Camail> I'm planning on moving within the year, so its not that bad

08:41:10 <Crisium> dat setplay
08:50:59 <Camail> none of those air legs can be comboed out of, btw
08:52:46 <Camail> but yea she's really good
08:53:23 <Camail> i dunno if i wanna learn safe jumps =/
08:54:12 <Camail> jwong gets a boner for sweep crush counters
08:54:20 <Camail> so it makes sense that he's hyped
08:55:11 <Crisium> hes certain chun is the best char, for other reasons too
08:55:56 <Crisium> chun way more entertaining in SFV than 3S though
08:56:01 <Crisium> that was one boring top tier
08:58:09 <Camail> ending a combo in lk sbk is really good
08:59:02 <Camail> I'm always more interested in the tech thats used frequently
08:59:18 <Camail> like b.hp buffered into hk legs
09:01:24 <Camail> ex legs is waaaay safer
09:02:23 <Camail> but if you're jsut using it to stuff their pokes then why waste meter

16:23:54 <Micen> Hello
16:25:20 <Micen> I want to draw, but dont know what to draw
16:25:54 <DoT`> warhammer pony
16:25:57 <Micen> No, 
16:26:02 <Micen> I need to work on eyes
16:26:05 <Micen> also no armor. 
16:26:08 <Micen> ever. too hard
16:27:06 <Micen> the odds of me ever drawing it have not changed. But i will go on record staritng i will draw your damn zebra balancing on one hoof before attempting bad armor. :P
16:29:59 <DoT`> well micen i always tell you to practice basics which you reply to "you must go outside your comfort zone"
16:30:00 <DoT`> :P
16:30:35 <Rawr|Phone> .roll d20 to tickle micen
16:30:40 <Rawr|Phone> Woops
16:32:32 <Micen> but doing the basics is so boring :P
16:33:25 <DoT`> haha
16:33:43 <DoT`> and then you draw a really nice pony head and its nice
16:35:18 <Micen> Its still boring, when I could be doing more things like fighting poses for an hour trying to get it just perfect only to get into detailing and realize its not and go back and edit.

20:43:22 <skram> I have no freakin idea what those things are
20:43:46 <Phearlock> Apparently you listened to them
20:43:56 <Phearlock> Probably reaper indoctrination stuff, since you don't remember it.
20:45:20 <Rawr|Phone> Not okay
20:46:38 <skram> right so thats basically stomp and holler is like folk/indie/singer songwriter stuff
20:47:34 <skram> like sufjan stevens, boniver, iron&wine, NMH, antlers etc etc
20:48:19 <carcinisation> gg bunny
20:48:30 <skram> aand lilith is the same only with a female vocalist?

23:45:06 <Camail> i think shoulder is safe
23:45:11 <Camail> but like
23:45:14 <Camail> you know whats safe
23:45:18 <Camail> everyone has mostly the same stuff
23:45:22 <Camail> maybe 1 safe special move
23:45:27 <Camail> ex's are safe
23:45:30 <Camail> normals are safe
23:45:31 <Camail> sweeps are unsafe
23:45:56 <Crisium> true, but there's a difference between what is -1 on block and what is +2, etc
23:46:05 <Crisium> for knowing when to absolutely not press buttons
23:46:06 <Camail> also DPs have never been a less valid option since sf2
23:46:28 <Camail> true
23:47:06 <Camail> but at least she'll ahve only like 1 move thats as + as that
23:50:00 <BioPhone> Asdf
23:50:29 <BioPhone> So slep
