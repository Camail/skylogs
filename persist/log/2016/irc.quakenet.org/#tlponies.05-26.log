00:13:47 <DuB`> Mercy/pharah is our gig though, I think.
00:13:50 <DuB`> Always goes well.
00:14:04 <skram> Yeah the two mercypharah games we did was awesome

00:20:03 <skram> git gud, scrubs
00:20:14 <DuB`> Meanwhile on https://www.twitch.tv/gosugamers the meta is in shambles.
00:20:18 <DuB`> There's even a MEI.
00:20:34 <DoT`> lol
00:20:53 <DoT`> where there balance changes with the release?
00:21:18 <DuB`> Don't believe so.
00:21:32 <DuB`> Turns out a Bastion in recon mode is basically just a S76, by the way.
00:21:34 <DuB`> Kappa

00:26:00 <Runbunny> !!!
00:26:24 <Phearlock> Want a link to the subreddit?

00:27:56 <DoT`> there is a mercy!
00:28:01 <skram> thats amazing dot
00:28:09 <DuB`> ROFL
00:28:11 <DuB`> That
00:28:18 <Phearlock> hahaha
00:28:18 <DuB`> Is why I LOVE it when people pick bastion.
00:28:38 <DuB`> Meanwhile most of the rest of the population is crying OP...
00:28:41 <DoT`> that poor bastion looks confused and sad
00:28:49 <DuB`> Seriously, don't visit any OW forums or twitch chats. >.>
00:28:54 <DoT`> lol
00:28:56 <Runbunny> what do you got Phearlock?
00:29:01 <skram> bastion is easy to counter
00:29:04 <DoT`> people are bad dub
00:29:09 <DoT`> so many counters to bastion
00:29:15 <Phearlock> What do you mean runbunny? =)
00:29:16 <DuB`> Yah.
00:29:16 <skram> no fucking way to counter mcree standing round the corner with a fuckin flashbang
00:29:19 <Phearlock> I have nothing at all
00:29:21 <DuB`> I have far more trouble with torb.
00:29:23 <skram> and this is why mcree is bullshit and should be removed
00:29:39 <Runbunny> The link O:
00:29:52 <Runbunny> hmmmmmmm.
00:29:53 <DuB`> I just think his rightclick needs a slight further nerf.
00:29:58 <DuB`> It should really only be a tank-killer.
00:30:08 <DuB`> Not... everything.
00:30:24 <DoT`> you recall that youtube video skram all about how op bastion was, and at the end ïn conclusion, nerf mccree¨
00:30:42 <skram> i dont recall actually
00:30:43 <Phearlock> oh r/overwatchporn is suddenly private for some reason.
00:30:45 <Phearlock> That's silly
00:31:20 <Runbunny> lel
00:31:38 <DoT`> you only have one site for it phear? that seems limiting
00:32:06 <Phearlock> oh, found another one, nvm we good
00:32:35 <DuB`> We played a team of nearly-level-40 guys today.
00:32:52 <DuB`> I'm not even sure how it's possible to have even less of a life than me and skram have for the last few days.
00:32:52 <Phearlock> not porn, but butt http://i.imgur.com/LFfcEO8.jpg
00:32:53 <DuB`> :P
00:33:05 <DuB`> Butt butt.
00:33:25 <Runbunny> lel
00:34:09 <DoT`> what level you dub?
00:34:15 <skram> is there a free alternative to fraps that isnt shit
00:34:49 <Runbunny> OBS
00:34:50 <DuB`> 26?
00:34:52 <DuB`> Or something.
00:34:59 <Runbunny> Skram.
00:35:15 <skram> thank you anders
00:35:19 <Phearlock> Shadowplay if you have an nvidia card, otherwise yeah OBS
00:35:30 <Phearlock> Dxtory also good but I think that's only free trial
00:35:42 <DuB`> I couldn't get OW to stream well, last time I tried. :(
00:35:52 <DuB`> Either stuttery or horribly boxy-pixelated.
00:35:57 <skram> I might make a overwatch frag movie in like 3 years when I got enough plays
00:36:12 <skram> Too bad theres no demo support yet
00:36:20 <DuB`> You guys gonna play anymore or do I NA? :)
00:36:37 <Runbunny> just press highlights and hit record on OBS
00:36:44 <skram> Ill join you on NA in like 10 mins dub
00:36:44 <Runbunny> easy peasy.
00:37:15 <DuB`> Bio you want to as well or no?
00:37:20 <skram> Because im not a whiner even though I have 200 ping, BIO.
00:37:27 <DuB`> Heheh.
00:38:35 <Bio> fuck off
00:38:50 <skram> :-----D
00:39:00 <Runbunny> Skram you dick face.
00:39:19 <DoT`> such a hors
00:40:15 <DuB`> I'm not sure why I hadn't set mercy beam toggle before.
00:40:22 <DuB`> Because it's 5000% better.
00:41:29 <DoT`> yes
00:42:07 <DoT`> i also turned off it prefering the one i am beamed to during free weekend
00:43:09 <Runbunny> the last guardian thing?
00:43:25 <DoT`> ?
00:43:40 <Runbunny> the fly to guy ability.
00:43:40 <DoT`> there are 2 settings in controls to do with the beam
00:44:32 <DoT`> one is toggle, the other is something like ¨ prefer beam target as swoop to person¨
00:45:56 <DuB`> Wat.
00:46:08 <DuB`> No I mean the hold-mouse-button or don't-hold option thingie.
00:46:19 <DoT`> yea, thats the toggle setting
00:46:35 <DoT`> this isnt that complex

00:54:34 <DuB`> There's "toggle beam" and "guardian angel prefers beam target".
00:54:39 <DuB`> I was talking about the first.
00:54:51 <DuB`> And having the second one on just seems like having less control. :O
00:54:58 <DoT`> yes, i replied to that and then mentioned the second
00:55:04 <DuB`> o
00:55:05 <DoT`> saying i turned it off

01:06:23 <Micen> oh you dropped. 
01:06:29 <Phearlock> There is such a thing as too much detail
01:06:34 <Phearlock> So that nothing stands out
01:06:43 <Phearlock> I feel that guy fucked up
01:07:01 <Dott> i seem to have missed an important part of this conversation
01:07:10 <Dott> yes micen i did, right after i asked :/
01:07:15 <Micen> the color looks way better
01:07:37 <Micen> redraw this dot
01:07:38 <Micen>  https://www.facebook.com/TheBoxOfficeArtist/photos/pb.365410143537898.-2207520000.1464224728./1033977973347775/?type=3&theater
01:08:05 <Micen> Phear, the color really helps with this one I think
01:08:06 <Micen> https://www.facebook.com/TheBoxOfficeArtist/photos/pb.365410143537898.-2207520000.1464224728./1038899409522298/?type=3&theater
01:08:06 <Dott> ouch my eyes
01:08:28 <Phearlock> Not so much color as shading
01:08:31 <Phearlock> and yeah that helps a lot
01:08:35 <Dott> the colour helps
01:09:25 <Bio> asdf
01:09:33 <Phearlock> but stuff like that is a lot of the reason I don't generally like a lot of warhammer40k stuff, it's like they added so much stuff for the sake of "more stuff".
01:09:34 <Dott> asdf
01:09:41 <Phearlock> That the entire thing ends up being pretty bland
01:09:43 <Dott> thast not warhammer
01:09:47 <Phearlock> no
01:10:09 <Phearlock> But I'm comparing the issue with it cause thats the place I see that seems to do it the most.
01:10:44 <Phearlock> Most of the smaller scale WH40k stuff is good
01:10:59 <Phearlock> But the scaled up stuff like starships tend to look bleh because of it
01:11:23 <Phearlock> (to me)
01:12:13 <Dott> i think that kind of style can be done really well, and sometimes it doesnt work
01:12:25 <Dott> but i played the table top warhammer for years so am probably biased
01:12:30 <Phearlock> That's ok
01:12:38 <Dott> i would hope so
01:12:44 <Phearlock> I think a lot of the ideas are great, just a lot of their designs are too busy
01:12:58 <Phearlock> And try to make everything awesome stand out
01:13:53 <Phearlock> To use a dumb example, it's like you thought boobs look good, so you put 15 boobs on the thing.
01:14:00 <Phearlock> And suddenly whoops
01:14:02 <Dott> In a lot of them its meant to be like that ina way, its more about the scale that the individual parts
01:14:11 <Dott> not the boobs analogy
01:14:23 <Phearlock> sorry xD
01:14:38 <skram> the fuck you talking about, 15 boobs sounds awesome
01:15:35 <Dott> a lot of the larger scale over complex arts are meant to have a chatoic feel to them
01:15:39 <Dott> ignore that pun micen!
01:15:53 <skram> chatoic
01:15:56 <skram> is that french for cat-like
01:15:58 <Dott> i cant spell
01:16:27 <Phearlock> Yeah that's a good point dot
01:16:32 <Phearlock> and I agree it can be done really well
01:17:47 <Phearlock> I like stuff like the star destroyers of star wars, that look like they have a good splattering of "detail areas" but also just a lot of simple shapes.
01:18:19 <Phearlock> Armor-y stuff with a bunch of doodads and lights and mechanic bits underneath

05:50:14 <Camail_> it might depend on the class you play, but honestly ever since seasons started i never go through the campaign
05:50:20 <Camail_> though it depends on the last time you played
05:50:30 <Camail_> if it was before loot 2.0 yea its easier because loot doesnt suck
05:53:23 <motbob> i don't have the expansion so i can only do the campaign

10:40:19 <Runbunny> PINGIS!
10:40:51 <DoT|Phone> runbun. did you grow up reading Hagar the horrible
10:41:30 <Rawr|Fone> I did
10:41:38 <Runbunny> I don't think so.
10:41:40 <Rawr|Fone> He is called hagbard handfaste here
10:42:06 <Runbunny> I weren't much for cartoons when I was younger.
10:42:59 <DoT|Phone> does it mean the same Rawr
10:43:19 <Rawr|Fone> No
10:43:37 <Rawr|Fone> Handfaste means he has a steady hand
10:43:50 <Rawr|Fone> But nobody would really use it as a word
10:44:19 <DoT|Phone> lol. because to swede the Viking isn't horrible?
10:45:02 <Rawr|Fone> He is also called hagbard den förskräcklige
10:45:03 <Runbunny> Dot, vikings aren't horrible.
10:45:26 <Runbunny> börk
10:45:30 <Rawr|Fone> It doesn't mean he is horrible, but something close
10:45:43 <Rawr|Fone> Although more positive I think
10:45:57 <Rawr|Fone> You can use it both ways I guess
10:46:24 <DoT|Phone> haha. a mods positive horrible
10:46:25 <DoT|Phone> more
10:50:27 <DoT|Phone> runbun. did you at least read asterix and obilix as a kid

10:51:30 <Rawr|Fone> Yiss
10:52:17 <CockRoach|42> hi tredc :)
10:52:48 <DoT|Phone> I'm worried angel didn't have a childhood
10:53:19 <Rawr|Fone> D:
10:53:26 <Runbunny> I read a bit of asterix, smurfs and garfield.
10:53:46 <DoT|Phone> I have never read smurfs

10:57:35 <Runbunny> Hardly.
10:57:54 <Runbunny> I read tintin Dot.
10:58:02 <DoT|Phone> oh yes. tin tin
10:58:20 <Runbunny> Just like his dog "Snowy" which was called Terrie in Denmark.
10:58:38 <DoT|Phone> No weird name for him?
