00:25:58 <DuB`> Homework pls.
00:28:21 <ZK> im looking at the flash vods, its fun watching
00:28:37 <ZK> hes good at this starcraft game
00:29:18 <ZK> its crazy looking at his mineral count
00:30:49 <Crisium> hes pretty good but also zealots are a good unit against him
00:31:06 <Crisium> still remember when bisu beat him in the final SPL ever
00:31:40 <ZK> bisu and flash back at bw
00:32:23 <ZK> yea, im guessing bw will never again be an esport, but that would be interesting

00:34:06 <Crisium> oh nice
00:34:25 <ZK> i know a famous person!
00:35:04 <ZK> watching bw really show how sc2 is muc more fast paced, and bw is much more about careful positionment
00:36:07 <motbob> first flash VOD and he gets dt'd LOLLLLLLLL
00:36:13 <motbob> PROTOSS
00:36:15 <Crisium> https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/tpkvw0y8b1ui4ral1fjb.jpg
00:36:24 <Crisium> http://i.imgur.com/sSa4tPQ.jpg
00:36:39 <Crisium> this is why protoss is best race
00:36:41 <Crisium> it keeps you honest
00:36:50 <ZK> it looks like the future is nigh
00:36:59 <ZK> if i played bw, i feel i would play protoss
00:37:14 <ZK> TvP is fun though
00:37:21 <ZK> and ZvP too
00:37:24 <ZK> playing vs protoss is fun
00:37:29 <Crisium> i played them mainly because they have fewer units to control than zerg and terran
00:37:39 <Crisium> even mech has mass vultures and siegeing of tanks to do
00:37:42 <Crisium> protoss is 1a
00:37:43 <Crisium> 2a
00:37:44 <Crisium> 3a
00:37:45 <Crisium> 4a
00:38:14 <Crisium> with sometimes using templar or arbiters
00:38:21 <ZK> no reavers?
00:38:52 <Crisium> my shuttle micro is atrocious
00:39:08 <Crisium> though i won some D and D- games with a good reaver before back in the day
