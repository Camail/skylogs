02:03:03 <DuB`> Pause button in competitive overwatch, finally. ^_^
02:03:22 <ZK> why would you want to pause :o
02:03:25 <ZK> forever keep playing
02:06:06 <Camail> dub let me tell you a secret
02:06:11 <Camail> they put it in csgo
02:06:13 <Camail> it doesnt help
02:06:20 <Camail> only when someone gets DCd
02:06:26 <Camail> and even then probably not long enough
02:06:35 <Camail> especially for a game that doesnt have rounds like OW
02:06:43 <Camail> its a good attempt, but it never matters
02:06:45 <ZK> resume from replay is the way to go
02:06:48 <DuB`> Mostly for DC's I'm happy.
02:07:38 <Camail> I have 0 optimism

20:28:17 <skrma> I tried to update my audio drivers
20:28:23 <skrma> Now my pc is kill
20:29:21 <DoT|Phone> oh dear
20:31:04 <skrma> I installed it and rebooted, then I had no sound, so I uninstalled it and then my USB stuff stopped working
20:31:29 <DoT|Phone> why you break it
20:31:36 <skrma> So I rebooted and my mouse/keyboard wont work in the login screen but works during boot
20:31:50 <Rawr|Phone> Pls fix
20:31:53 <skrma> Soooo just gonna reinstall I guess :p
20:35:21 <skrma> hmm
20:35:50 <skrma> They dont work during the windows install thing either
20:36:05 <skrma> this is weird
20:38:50 <Camail> inb4 mobo dies
20:39:30 <Camail> that's always been the culprit for the wtf problems for me...
20:39:39 <skrma> however ps/2 works
20:39:49 <skrma> but it booted from a usb stick?
20:39:54 <skrma> i dont get it
20:43:17 <Camail> so....problem solved?
20:44:10 <skrma> no usb devices still dont work
20:44:40 <skrma> oh except for this one port obviously
20:45:03 <Camail> well thats...lul
20:45:09 <Camail> I amg lad I'm not you
20:45:15 <Camail> I mean, I always am glad I'm not you
20:45:17 <Camail> but especially now
20:45:19 <DoT|Phone> Skram please
20:45:34 <Camail> my morning ritual of thanking jesus for not being you is especially relevant
20:45:47 <Camail> OH
20:45:50 <Camail> its dots fault
20:45:52 <Camail> that explains it
20:47:30 <Golly> watching faze play hurts my soul
20:47:46 <Golly> and i dont even believe in those
20:47:52 <Golly> thats how much it hurts
20:51:09 <skrma> ok so apparently lots of people have had this thing happen with this motherboard
20:51:12 <skrma> so i think its ded
20:51:19 <DoT|Phone> oh dear
20:52:10 <Golly> hopefully it didnt take any other parts down with it
20:53:53 <skrma> nah it seems everything else works

21:11:09 <ZK> TROUT OF LOOOOOOOOOVE
21:15:26 <skrma> ok so i sorta fixed it
21:15:30 <skrma> still no fucking sound though
21:17:27 <Camail> tried default drivers?
21:18:42 <skrma> what do you mean
21:18:49 <skrma> like windows drivers?
21:19:33 <Camail> for audio
21:19:44 <skrma> yes
21:19:46 <Camail> cant you revert to defualt drivers
21:19:54 <Camail> yea might as well try
21:20:29 <Camail> I've done it for video drivers before cuz new ones on my laptop messed it up
21:21:07 <skrma> i dont think there is such a thing as default drivers cam, if there is i cant find them
21:21:11 <skrma> but i did uninstall them
21:21:19 <skrma> and then install newest version
21:21:22 <skrma> which fucked it up
21:23:25 <Camail> well maybe not default, but try to revert to an older version of the drivers
21:23:37 <skrma> oh
21:23:46 <skrma> cant do that now since i have removed it
21:24:22 <Camail> hmmm...can you find an older version of the driver
21:24:28 <Camail> id imagine thats a thing
21:26:31 <Camail> if all else fails use a restore point
21:30:23 <Zounds> night guys
21:31:16 <Camail> cya
21:39:20 <skrma> finding old drivers is difficult apparently
21:40:24 <skrma> looks like the new driver will only work with a new BIOS
21:40:33 <skrma> which is only in beta and sorta unstable
21:40:35 <skrma> gj
21:41:34 <Camail> restore point might be your only option?
21:41:50 <Camail> thats kinda weird that they would release that driver
21:45:58 <skrma> its kinda fucked uo
21:46:01 <skrma> p
21:53:07 <Rawr|Phone> Like ur face
