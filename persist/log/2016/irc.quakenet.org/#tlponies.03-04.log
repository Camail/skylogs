18:51:29 <skram> Im not a fan of shrimp honestly
18:51:40 <Phearlock> More for me!
18:52:22 <skram> Im pretty picky about seafood in general
18:52:46 <skram> unless its made of salmon
18:53:46 <DuB`> I should go out for sushi lunch tomorrow.
18:53:48 <DuB`> Mmmmmm.

18:57:45 <DoT|Phone1> I don't eat fish. I just wanted to be part of the conversation
18:58:03 <DuB`> I actually hated all seafood a few years ago.
18:58:11 <DuB`> Now I realize that I just hate COOKED seafood.
18:58:14 <DuB`> :D
18:58:33 <DuB`> Everything has a much milder flavor when fresh and uncooked.
18:58:57 <ZK> oysters are great
18:59:22 <Phearlock> I like fresh stuff and fried stuff more than cookes
18:59:32 <Phearlock> but there's some cooked stuff that I enjoy a lot too.
18:59:38 <DoT|Phone1> I like cake
19:00:18 <DuB`> Any and all sweets. <3
