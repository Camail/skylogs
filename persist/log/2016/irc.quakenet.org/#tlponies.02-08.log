01:19:24 <Camail> also I've noticed that almost every single stream on twitch has a shitty title

01:20:10 <Camail> like, actively making me  not want to check out your stream because the titled is either extremely boring, generic, or poorly made
01:20:16 <DoT`> People really suck at titles cam
01:20:31 <Camail> give it like 5 minutes of thought
01:20:35 <Camail> thats a lot of time to think!
01:20:47 <Camail> you'll come up with something that's better than everyone else
01:20:50 <Camail> the bar is so low
01:20:57 <DoT`> 2  minutes should do it'
01:22:32 <Camail> like, there ae so many little things you can do with 1 sentence that can tell people what your channel is like
01:22:50 <Camail> its THE first impression
01:23:12 <Camail> ugh, just ranting, it's something I've noticd any time I've went out to actually look for new channels

01:42:05 <DuB`> Er, I guess stream delay.

02:03:51 <DuB`> dot
02:04:07 <DoT`> i closed irc on phone
02:04:19 <DuB`> Scarlett in chat: tfw I told huk to build more immortals when he was struggling against zerg a 2 weeks ago
02:04:21 <DuB`> Heheh.
02:04:33 <DoT`> i saw haha
02:19:46 <DoT`> poorscarlett
02:36:48 <DoT`> i hate how loud the map intros are
02:38:15 <DuB`> Hmm.
02:38:20 <DuB`> They are way cool, though.
02:38:32 <DoT`> they are, but too loud
02:38:32 <Camail> i finally watched the second little witch academia
02:38:43 <Camail> put that off way too long
02:38:52 <DoT`> wasnt that recent?
02:39:07 <Camail> last year
02:39:30 <Camail> july 3 2015, according to google
02:39:35 <Camail> which was awhile ago
02:39:42 <Camail> errr
02:39:44 <Camail> google emssed up
02:39:49 <Camail> thats the announcment date
02:40:10 <Camail> october 9th
02:40:20 <DoT`> still a fair time i supose
02:40:24 <Camail> still 4 months
02:40:25 <DoT`> i shoudl watch it soon
02:40:46 <DoT`> I didnt realise it was out
02:41:28 <Camail> there were parts that I couldn't stand but because of the rapid pacing they turned out tolerable or exactly what was needed
02:42:16 <Camail> fitting an entire story arc in 50 minutes makes any surface level unpalatable scenes makes sense
02:45:56 <DoT`> why they go for a single only 50 minute thing? just what the funds allowed for?
02:49:03 <DoT`> Dub, more huk
02:49:08 <DuB`> Yep.
02:49:51 <motbob> LWA 2 was OK
02:50:00 <motbob> the first 10-15 minutes were reat

03:06:21 <BioSC> hi
03:06:41 <DoT`> immortal strats pretty good right now
03:07:07 <DuB`> Seems so.
03:14:36 <DoT`> stream?
03:14:44 <DoT`> or my internet
03:16:22 <Camail> dot go to sleep
03:16:30 <DoT`> soon
03:17:00 <DoT`> then more cs tomorow
03:17:38 <DoT`> earlier i changed the targets in training to head size, HAHA, im no where near that yet
03:18:25 <DuB`> Yeah dot, bad stream.
03:19:04 <DoT`> gg
03:22:20 <Camail> DoT`  eh, i dont do that, i use 12, sometimes 10
03:22:38 <Camail> you rarely get headshots because you flick to them 
03:22:39 <DoT`> 12 is standard
03:22:58 <Camail> especailly the shots the map gives you
03:23:17 <Camail> something to consider, make the required # bullets to break a target 3 instead of 1
03:23:24 <Camail> helps with flicks into spraying
03:23:30 <DoT`> ok
03:23:40 <Camail> need to be able to flick while ahving your hand in a comfortable position to continue the spray
03:23:48 <Camail> its the most important part of aiming in csgo

20:40:08 <carcinisation> hi cane
20:40:12 <Cane> Hi. <3
20:40:20 <Cane> Sorry, I got this stuck in my head and had to hear it.
20:41:37 <skrma> So you decided to torment the rest of us?
20:42:06 <Cane> If I have to suffer I'm taking the rest of you bastards with me!
20:42:16 <skrma> thats kinda cruel mr. cane. You know I cant not click that when it comes up!
20:42:44 <Cane> I should learn to play this and come visit skrma for vacation.
20:43:53 <skrma> Good luck! GPSes usually dont know where I live so you might have some trouble :p
20:45:47 <carcinisation> made it :D
20:47:19 <skrma> What'd you make, Mr. Reif?
20:48:02 <carcinisation> into the 100 ppl who get free tourney tickets
20:48:18 <skrma> cool beans
20:48:23 <skrma> holdem?
20:48:37 <DoT|Phone1> woohoo
20:48:45 <carcinisation> yep skram
20:49:16 <carcinisation> with ftops coming up i may well be playing some razz
20:49:44 <skrma> razz?
20:50:10 <carcinisation> razz is lowball stud game
20:50:23 <skrma> oh
20:50:28 <carcinisation> looks like the best shot at getting to final table/winning
20:50:42 <skrma> there are so many weird poker variants
20:50:44 <carcinisation> and thus getting a nifty jacket or something like that
20:51:20 <carcinisation> razz is pretty easy to understand and play
20:52:26 <skrma> Its just regular stud with with ace low?
20:53:22 <carcinisation> going for lowest hand, ace low, stud format and no straights/flushes apply
20:54:01 <skrma> i see
20:54:10 <skrma> i only ever play regular hold em
20:54:13 <carcinisation> it does seems to be the most rage inducing for some of my opponents
20:54:15 <motbob> i made this: http://www.teamliquid.net/blogs/503766-twitch-vod-downloader-highlight-finder
20:54:45 <motbob> no, i only made half of it
20:54:56 <Phearlock> Oooo
20:55:01 <Phearlock> This looks really nice
20:55:21 <motbob> it is!
20:56:15 <carcinisation> looks very nifty
20:57:49 <DoT|Phone1> very cool mot
20:58:41 <motbob> can I ask some of you to download it and see if it works?
21:00:18 <carcinisation> picnic
21:23:09 <Cane> motbob, hell yes you can.
21:23:11 <Cane> Grabbing it now.
21:23:35 <Cane> This is super useful if it works as advertised.
21:24:19 <Cane> I guess now I know why you wanted to talk to people who knew python.
21:26:15 <motbob> yes
21:26:27 <Cane> Wow that's slow.
21:27:05 <motbob> mmm
21:27:11 <motbob> gimme the command you used
21:27:20 <Cane> You already have it, I just clicked the file.
21:27:34 <Cane> Done.
21:27:36 <Cane> Lemme see now.
21:27:52 <Cane> Looking great. Synced.
21:28:16 <motbob> good
21:28:47 <Cane> Yep, video and audio synced perfectly, the quality is great, worked as advertised.
21:28:59 <Cane> I'll try it on a few other VODs.
21:29:02 <motbob> good shit; that's some good shit right there
21:29:34 <Cane> I remember when Twitch got started, downloading and syncing VODs was complete shit.
21:29:52 <motbob> ya only if you didn't know the magic ffmpeg command
21:30:15 <motbob> -copy_ts or something
21:30:44 <Cane> Yeeeep
21:32:44 <Cane> As I expected, I got a range exception when I didn't specify hours in the time code.
21:33:20 <Cane> Have to do 00:xx:xx
21:34:04 <motbob> if you run -h it tells you that :P
21:34:33 <Cane> That would take effort.
21:35:17 <DoT`> oh cool, cane did it
21:35:43 <Cane> What I wouldn't give for a progress bar.
21:35:58 <motbob> sorry
21:36:08 <DoT`> fancy gui please
21:36:11 <motbob> wait
21:36:20 <motbob> i can probably do that in like 1 minute
21:36:22 <motbob> START
21:36:26 <Cane> lol
21:36:30 <DoT`> haha
21:37:04 <motbob> n/m
21:37:07 <motbob> 5 minutes
21:37:18 <Cane> You're not R1CH, gtf outta here
21:37:25 <Cane> This is weird.
21:37:42 <Cane> I set it to download barely 14 seconds of gameplay and it's at 200MB and counting.
21:37:52 <motbob> yes
21:37:57 <motbob> it's in 2 minutes chunks
21:38:04 <Cane> Oh I get it.
21:38:08 <Cane> Because Twitch.
21:38:18 <Cane> It's fine.
21:38:22 <motbob> well
21:38:30 <motbob> i never use it for stuff that's that fine
21:38:47 <motbob> i think it would take a long time to figure out how to get that to work
21:38:55 <motbob> but, I think I could probably do it
21:39:38 <motbob> no, i'd have to rip up the whole script, fuck that
21:39:44 <Cane> Does it keep the 2m chunks anywhere or does it delete them after it renders the 15 second clip?
21:39:54 <motbob> it doesn't render a 15 second clip
21:39:57 <motbob> unfortunately
21:40:03 <Cane> Oh, I get it.
21:40:06 <motbob> BUT
21:40:11 <motbob> i bet i could make it do that
21:40:17 <motbob> much more easily than on the Twitch side
21:40:18 <Cane> Yeah, I'm starting to see the seams.
21:40:25 <Cane> Smart little program for what it is.
21:40:29 <motbob> it's just an ffmpeg command
21:40:31 <Cane> Yeah.
21:41:10 <motbob> in python, wtf does function(*parameter) mean instead of just function(parameter)
21:42:35 <Cane> Changes the allowable variable contents I believe?
21:42:40 <Cane> I should get back to learning Python.
21:42:43 <Cane> I started and then stopped.
21:43:18 <Cane> jesus monkey king christ it's at 380mb and showing no signs of stopping.
21:43:30 <Cane> I just wanted 15 seconds
21:43:31 <motbob> that shouldn't happen
21:43:36 <motbob> give me the command and the VOD
21:43:50 <motbob> wait
21:43:55 <motbob> i gues those are one and teh same
21:44:08 <motbob> i bet you're downloading an flv style VOD
21:44:22 <Cane> I am.
21:44:25 <Cane> zzz
21:44:43 <motbob> sorry
21:44:59 <Cane> Oh good.
21:45:06 <Cane> The first .flv file downloaded, 435MB.
21:45:09 <Cane> The second one has now started.
21:45:14 <motbob> rofl
21:45:28 <Yoltphone> Ponpon
21:45:32 <Cane> Your script is making me cry.
21:46:16 <motbob> well, for /b/ style VODs, older downloaders work OK
21:46:31 <motbob> you can specify a 28:30 chunk or whatever
21:47:09 <Cane> Is the new format new and .flv is just for old VODs, or does it have to do with highlights vs broadcasts?
21:47:24 <motbob> it's all about recency
21:47:40 <motbob> i don't think there's been a /b/ VOD for a year now
21:47:54 <Cane> Stupid question. Can't you just use Oddshot and download the VOD after it uploads the video?
21:47:57 <Cane> I haven't used Oddshot at all.
21:48:20 <motbob> i don't know what oddshot does to quality, but that could work if you're watching the stream
21:48:37 <Cane> You can't use it on VODs?
21:48:41 <Cane> And quality is a good point.
21:48:49 <motbob> have you ever used oddshot before?
21:48:55 <DoT`> Hey yolt
21:48:57 <Cane> Never, I just know it's a thing.
21:49:03 <motbob> i think it's just a live thing
21:49:19 <Cane> Hmm.
21:49:31 <DoT`> Ive only heard of it used live
21:49:41 <Cane> Looks like you need to use !shot in chat to capture it live.
21:49:58 <motbob> whatever. don't worry. I'm going to do this ffmpeg command thing.

22:00:15 <motbob> ya
22:00:20 <Yoltphone> I was not a lot here lately D:
22:00:23 <motbob> it's not going to let you specify a time for .flvs
22:00:40 <Cane> It's downloading the whole VOD at this point?
22:01:08 <motbob> ya
22:01:14 <Cane> I think I'll cancel that. =P

22:11:23 <Cane> Yes, thank you sweetie, that's impressive.

22:13:34 <motbob> again, though, older downloaders work OK for that format
22:14:09 <Cane> Right, I was just testing your script, I didn't need the video for anything.
