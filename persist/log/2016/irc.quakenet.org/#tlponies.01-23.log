00:26:01 <skram> .tell Cane May I be allowed to speak on the discords pretty please
00:26:32 <Cane> Ohai.
00:27:10 <Bio> hihi
00:27:44 <Cane> skram, fixed.
00:27:51 <Cane> I intended for other Shadowbolts to be able to add more members.
00:27:55 <skram> Thank you mister
00:27:57 <Cane> Can people not do that?
00:29:50 <Phearlock> I didn't try as I only saw him now.
00:30:02 <Phearlock> Maybe? xD
00:30:51 <Cane> If you click on people, do you see their "roles"?
00:32:36 <Phearlock> yes
00:32:43 <Cane> Can you change them?
00:32:45 <Cane> Or add roles?
00:32:52 <Dot_> oh ya, i need to join the discroed at some point
00:32:54 <Cane> Should be a + next to it.
00:33:18 <Phearlock> No + next to it, just text
00:33:21 <Cane> Hmm.
00:33:35 <Phearlock> though that may be cause they're same rank?
00:33:45 <Dot_> ?discord
00:33:53 <Dot_> where is the invite hidden cane?
00:34:01 <Cane> ?tlp
00:34:03 <Cane> But sweetie. =(
00:34:06 <Cane> Sec.
00:34:45 <Cane> https://discord.gg/0bdfUs3I4ECqKUTd
00:34:47 <Cane> That should be it.
00:34:56 <Cane> You should use the client though. <3
00:35:03 <Phearlock> I'll try with dot when he joins
00:35:23 <Dot_> i have discord
00:35:30 <Dot_> just havnt joind the tlp one
00:35:57 <CockRoach|42> i dont like the discord interface
00:37:21 <Phearlock> I can unmute him but I can't change his role cane
00:38:17 <Cane> Right, figures.
00:38:27 <Cane> The permissions system in Discord is fairly dumb.
00:38:39 <Cane> It's designed so that @everyone should have access by default.
00:39:02 -!- DoT|Phone [~Dot@94.9.42.184] has joined #tlponies
00:39:03 <Cane> I wanted an @everyone permissions person (first time joiner etc) to have to be added to members or shadowbolts or whatever.
00:39:09 <Cane> In order to join other channels and speak.
00:39:15 <Cane> That way everyone can vouch for whoever joins.
00:39:36 <Cane> So all of TLP would be a Shadowbolt/moderator and should be able to add just-joined @everyones to a membership list.
00:39:47 <Cane> To do that I'll have to give all of you global access to add, remove, and edit roles.
00:40:00 <Cane> So I'll do that. Please fuck with it as little as possible, just use it to add membership roles.
00:40:12 <Cane> Because if you edit roles or whatever some of the channel permissions can get weird. =P
00:40:19 <Cane> So just assign roles to people and call it a day.
00:40:30 <Cane> There.
00:40:40 <Cane> Shadowbolts should be able to click on people and assign roles to anyone.
00:40:51 <Cane> The question now is, can you add people to alicorn roles?
00:40:54 <Cane> Anyone want to test?
00:41:02 <Phearlock> yes
00:41:05 <Phearlock> Can do that
00:41:18 <Cane> Try it on yourself Phearlock.
00:41:19 <Cane> What happens?
00:41:51 <Phearlock> I can remove myself haha
00:41:55 <Cane> LOL
00:42:00 <Cane> Can you re-add yourself now?
00:42:01 <Phearlock> (now I can't do anything)
00:42:02 <Phearlock> no
00:42:03 <Cane> Hahahah.
00:42:07 <Phearlock> =D
00:42:14 <Cane> This is why Discord is fucking dumb. =D
00:42:25 <Cane> Alicorn yourself.
00:42:38 <Cane> Can you edit server stuff now?
00:42:48 <Cane> Go to Liquestria in the top left and click server settings.
00:43:00 <Phearlock> yes
00:43:04 <Cane> Yeah, so that's a thing.
00:43:07 <Cane> Great.
00:43:11 <Cane> This is why the permissions system in Discord is stupid.
00:43:12 <DoT|Phone> lol
00:43:40 <Phearlock> Anyway, gonnna Falcon BMS MP a bit.
00:43:41 <Cane> Oh well, I don't care, it's TLP.
00:43:53 <Cane> Just add yourselves/each other to Shadowbolts or whatever as you wish.
00:44:05 <Cane> Non-TLP members who want in can join if you vouch for them, just add them to members I suppose.
00:45:47 <Camail> oh hey a new technology is being a bitch, what a surprise
00:45:58 <Cane> I'm as shocked as you are Camail.
00:46:00 * Camail rolls wheel down a hill with a stick
00:46:24 <Cane> It's almost like making things pretty at the expense of existing features is obnoxious or something.
00:46:40 <Camail> nah, I prefer form over function
00:46:43 <Camail> or neither
00:47:03 <Camail> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazyhouse
00:47:07 <Camail> this is the best cess variant ever
00:47:10 <Camail> chess*
00:47:56 <Cane> I think I need to play that.
00:49:13 <DoT|Phone> can I be an Alicorn then please cane
00:49:16 <DoT|Phone> :p
00:49:18 <Camail> wow dot
00:49:20 <Camail> check ur priv
00:49:30 <Camail> vod of someone playing it http://www.twitch.tv/chessnetwork/v/36818389
00:49:38 <Camail> fucking ri my ywitch plugin
00:49:43 <Camail> might just migrate the plugins
00:49:50 <Camail> thought it would be fixed before i needed that
00:49:52 <Cane> Oh hey, you linked to a Jerry stream.
00:49:59 <Cane> Who sadly is not german.
00:50:00 <Camail> ya, I love his stuff
00:51:30 -!- Emily [~HoMM@mobile-access-5d6aad-204.dhcp.inet.fi] has joined #tlponies
00:52:51 <Cane> Such a bizarre but fun variant.
00:54:34 <Dot_> cam, dont you play tl cs soon?  its friday
00:56:10 <Cane> Camail, this variant is hurting my brain.
00:56:24 <Cane> I play chess regularly and I keep being surprised that pieces just appear while I'm checking lines and analyzing the position.

00:58:08 <Phearlock> so cool =3
00:58:58 <Cane> That is awesome.
00:59:50 <CockRoach|42> tsitra <3
01:05:45 <Camail> Dot_  that stopped awhile ago
01:06:20 <Dot_> oh? that sucks
01:06:33 <Camail> yea, but its w/e
01:06:35 <Camail> nothing i could do
01:06:56 <Camail> it only takes 1 toxic player for people to not want to go
01:06:58 <DoT|Phone> who you pay with now?
01:08:59 <motbob> Camail can you test something fo me?
01:09:06 <motbob> if you're on windows?
01:09:50 <motbob> or anyone else? i'm not picky
01:12:01 <motbob> actually never mind
01:21:52 <Cane> lol
01:22:23 <Camail> well then
01:22:29 <Camail> i wasnt looking >_>
01:22:43 <Camail> and i dont ahve ping noises because zk would annoy me to death
01:23:09 <motbob> i was going to ask you to test this thing to see if it works on your machine
01:23:17 <motbob> but then i realized that it doesn't even owrk on MY machine
01:23:18 <Dot_> .tell Bio http://equumamici.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Loves-BOOKS-Animated-577720890
01:24:01 <motbob> i found an extremely convenient program called py2exe which does exactly what I need it to do, which is transform a python script into a portable .exe
01:24:17 <motbob> but it's broken 3 different ways so far so I think I'm just going to give up
01:24:31 <Camail> ah
01:24:37 <Camail> i rarely use ython on windows, tbh
01:24:41 <Camail> python*
01:24:59 <motbob> i haven't used anything but windows for about 1.5 years now
01:25:09 <motbob> in general
01:35:14 <motbob> OMG IT WORKED GG
01:38:24 <DoT|Phone> \o/
01:39:25 <motbob> http://www.mediafire.com/download/5x3mzlaah0ehm38/downloader.rar anyone who wants to test it, please do. extract and run the .bat
01:39:38 <motbob> extract the whole thing and run the .bat *
01:39:58 <motbob> and then if it looks like it's downloading something, that means it's working
01:40:08 <Camail> ok but what does it do
01:40:16 <Camail> does it kill me
01:40:21 <Camail> thats my only concern
01:40:30 <motbob> it downloads two minute chunks of twitch VODs
01:40:55 <motbob> (and concats them if you have ffmpeg)
01:41:33 <CockRoach|42> http://i.imgur.com/t38Hdim.jpg
01:48:32 <motbob> it downloads a gig of stuff so if it doesn't throw an error message right away, that's good enough of a test for my purposes
01:59:29 <Camail> motbob  started downloading
01:59:34 <Camail> worked for me
01:59:35 <motbob> good shit
01:59:50 <Saurabhinator> http://i.imgur.com/NAvqJH2.webm
02:00:19 <motbob> congrat's, you're in possession of maybe the only app that lets you plug in a start- and end-time for a Twitch VOD and have it actually deliver you the VOD
02:00:47 <motbob> congrats*
02:05:20 <Camail> cool

20:30:00 <Micen_> They have a history!
20:30:50 <Micen_> She watched Twi grow up. Was there for all the important life events. They could spend less time getting to know eachother, and more time Getting To Know eachother.
20:32:34 <DoT|Phone> almost as weird as shipping Celestia and twi
20:33:49 <CockRoach|42> weird ship... or better ship...
20:34:54 <Micen_> Well that just isnt weird at all. Celetia is so old that getting to know a pony at any point in their life really wouldnt seem like that long. So she would take the fleeting love whereever she could find that it went both ways.
20:35:10 <Micen_> Jeeze, its like you dont enjoy shipping Dot.

22:23:56 <Phearlock> hi =)
22:24:43 <Phearlock> I saw that gfy Cane, prettyyyy slick
22:25:38 <Micen_> Hello Phear. Dot talked me out of drawing a Twidance ship pic.
22:26:00 <Phearlock> Do you want some Twidance fics to get re-inspired?
22:26:04 <Micen_> Now I am drawing Chrysilight instead.
22:26:10 <Phearlock> Ooooh that's also a great one
22:26:17 <Phearlock> Barely any pics of that ship
22:26:39 <CockRoach|42> :)
22:26:49 <Micen_> I know. I just caught up with the latest chapter of Changling mating rituals, or whatever that fic is called
22:27:12 <CockRoach|42> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/299781/changeling-courtship-rituals ?
22:27:14 <Micen_> well mostly caught up. stopped to go make myself coffee
22:27:16 <Micen_> yes!
22:27:42 <Phearlock> Probably the best Chylight ship around atm.
22:27:42 <Micen_> and whoops i am a chapter and a half behind
22:27:49 <Phearlock> So cute.

22:51:03 <Micen_> my Babs Seed head keeps falling off
22:51:39 <Phearlock> The real headless horse
22:52:22 <Micen_> I need to get a shelf for my ponies, I am running out of room on my desk
23:00:06 <Dot_> i forgot countess rara and her razzle dazzle existed
23:00:56 <Phearlock> her second song was so nice
23:09:39 <Micen_> I need to binge pony again soon
23:09:48 <Micen_> its been so long since i have seen seasons 1-3
23:10:40 <Phearlock> Lesson zero = always good ep
23:11:07 <Dot_> well that ep sounds a way off
23:11:30 <Phearlock> About in the middle if you're watching S1-3 =)
23:11:36 <Micen_> I think i might do a scene from each episode
23:11:45 <Micen_> that would get me drawing.
