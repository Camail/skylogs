01:44:13 <Phearlock> Fuuuuuck. Decided to go online for some PVP planeshoots tonight, after 2 relatively easy kills on the first sortie I end up 1v3 on my second one.
01:44:20 <Phearlock> Fucking flying around trying not to get shot
01:44:24 <Phearlock> for 14 mins straight

01:48:04 <Phearlock> One of the 3 ran out of fuel
01:48:08 <Phearlock> one crashed somewhere
01:48:25 <Phearlock> and the last guy was forced away by another friendly in the end
01:48:44 <Dott`> close enough! 
01:48:58 <Phearlock> Then managed to limp the plane back home with inoperative flaps, speedbrakes, airspeed indicator, and busted landing gear.
01:49:23 <Phearlock> Slid off the runway and there were some sparks n shit but it didn't explode
01:49:37 <Phearlock> Good landing considering the circumstances.
01:49:37 <Dott`> woohoo

05:24:06 <DuB`> Hollywood A can be brutal. O_o
05:42:11 <Camail> i think i had what was the only ever competitive dreadnought game
05:48:37 <Camail> we were flipping on engine boosters, shield boosts, no boosters, all based on the shooting cycles in our sniper war, he was holding angles
05:49:27 <Camail> he outplayed me, it helped that he was always with his team and had 2 tac cruisers...
05:49:42 <Camail> but if you cant beat 'em, ignore them and shoot other people
05:58:14 <DuB`> TL 5TRACER???
06:05:07 <motbob> this format is pretty ba
06:05:08 <motbob> d
06:06:31 <motbob> you can't run WB advantage in a mirrored format like overwatch. Let's say a map is super imba and assault tends to win every game. A win trade is really good for the team with the WB advantage.
06:18:20 <motbob> or, i guess more accurately, a format where it's especially hard to get a 2-0 as opposed to a 2-1
07:05:26 <Camail> and just when i thought dreadnought could be a good game
07:05:35 <Camail> max ranked corvette has a full map teleport
07:05:52 <Camail> this game is such free to play garbage sometimes
07:06:57 <Camail> warp right next to me from outside the range of a sniper, drain my cooldowns and energy and burst me down instantly...
07:07:10 <Camail> there is literally nothing you can do about that
07:07:29 <Camail> unless there's something at rank 50 for toher ships
