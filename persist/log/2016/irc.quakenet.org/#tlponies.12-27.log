19:38:49 <ZK> which board games are on there btw?
19:38:51 <Camail> i dunno
19:39:01 <Camail> but there are a lot of marketplace games to DL
19:39:06 <Camail> pandemic might be a good start
19:39:12 <Camail> its a coop game for 2-4 players
19:39:17 <ZK> i love pandemic
19:39:22 <Camail> theres a ton zk
19:39:29 <Camail> its basically a torrent site for boardgames
19:39:36 <ZK> wonder if they have pandemic legacy
19:39:43 <ZK> id need to try that one day, but dont want to pay for it
19:39:52 <Camail> we could even do pandemic legacy, but i dont want to cuz i am gonna play a game of it irl
19:40:18 <ZK> well, if you do red, we could do blue
19:41:14 <ZK> also secret hitler is a lot of fun
19:41:32 <Camail> oh yea thats on there too
19:41:53 <Camail> its the gift that keeps on giving
19:42:33 <Camail> i got my dad a randomly generated cards against humanity card, it comes with the bigger blacker box
19:42:39 <Camail> it told him he had a big dick
19:42:50 <Camail> like it said "a dad with a massive dong"

19:49:19 <Camail> OH SHIT FROG FRACTIONS 2
19:49:21 <Camail> its finally out
19:58:27 <ZK> what is this?
20:01:24 <Camail> frog fractions was a game pretending to be a pre-school math game
20:02:20 <Camail> but it escalated and became a really weird game
20:02:40 <Camail> then he made a kickstarter for a sequel, giving no info about it or when it would come out
20:02:43 <Camail> or what it would be called
20:02:47 <ZK> that then had a sequel
20:03:14 <Camail> you can look up the rest, dont wanna spoil for anyone who might care
20:03:33 <Camail> suffice to say the game actually came out 2 weeks ago and they just figured it out
20:04:03 <ZK> they being the creators, right?
20:07:03 <Camail> no the gamers
20:07:12 <Camail> people had to find the game
