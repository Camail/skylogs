00:13:22 <Dot_> my hot water bottle is cold
00:14:22 <skram> then it is no longer a hot water bottle
00:15:15 <Dot_> right
00:15:25 <Dot_> its a sad water bottle
00:15:58 <skram> uh sure
00:15:59 <skram> yes
00:19:38 <Micen> Cold water is best water

00:49:20 <skram> ??
00:53:01 <motbob> The 6 sauce downgrades from 5 to 4 peppers, but the peppers are lit on fire
00:53:26 <motbob> I would imagine that the peppers are extinguished by the time they are ground into the sauce
00:53:46 <motbob> therefore, I posit that the 5 sauce is probably spicier than the 6 sauce

02:24:30 <Camail> maaaan i really want westworld to be good
02:24:34 <Camail> i dont think it will
02:24:41 <Camail> i think it might suck
02:26:38 <Camail> the one thing i am certain of is that the dialog is pretty bad
02:27:20 <ZK> oh
02:27:22 <ZK> thats too bad
02:27:40 <ZK> seemed promising with money spent
02:28:19 <Camail> its probably gonna be popular
02:29:23 <Camail> the more time they spend on humans the worse it will be
02:29:33 <Camail> hopefully the eliminate those subplots asap
02:29:47 <Camail> because those actors are bad and the lines are bad

03:42:10 <Micen__> there we go. its the wireless card im using
04:02:57 <motbob> these two guys were doing the character pick dance at the beginning of the match, but there have been no character changes during the match? what's up with that camail?
04:03:07 <Camail> ok so
04:03:20 <Camail> du plays guile, and he hates the balrog match
04:03:35 <Camail> pr rog hate balrog vs mika
04:04:07 <Camail> so if rog played balrog du was gonna play mika, which made him go to 
04:04:10 <Camail> necalli
04:04:30 <Camail> but once the match started the characters werent as important
04:04:48 <Camail> also they were both fine with this matchup
04:05:00 <Camail> they wouldnt be able to get a good match up, so an even one was preferable
04:05:12 <Camail> also once a match starts the in-match info is important
04:05:39 <Camail> its risky to change mid set
04:05:46 <Camail> presents new variables to learn
04:05:49 <Camail> and you already just lost
04:06:48 <Camail> maybe du would've change to guile if rog was winning
04:07:00 <Camail> but pr rog sure as fuck wasn't gonna go to balrog vs mika, ever
04:07:12 <Camail> balrog doesn't have a good reversal game, and mika is all about set ups
04:08:47 <Camail> if rog won 2-0 du would probably go to Guile
04:11:44 <motbob> this stream quality is making me cum
04:28:36 <motbob> i haven't watched sfv since guile came out
04:30:41 <Camail> did you watch evo
04:30:55 <Camail> cuz guile came out in april
04:31:35 <motbob> i think i watched one match
04:47:46 <Micen__> .tell Bio I have received 5.

08:15:05 <Runbunny> No Skram.
08:15:13 <Runbunny> Why are you even up btw?
08:15:38 <skram> because its daytime now?

08:15:58 <Micen_> It is still dark out
08:16:35 <skram> not in the civilized word micen
08:17:12 <Micen_> What are you talking about? I was taught in my school that America was the civilized world and everywhere else was savage frontier land.
08:17:37 <Micen_> land that needed to be tamed and brought under the Red, White and Blue.
08:17:47 <skram> I think you'll find its the opposite of that micen
08:18:33 <Micen_> This is true. But the real question is how do we end the world?
08:18:40 <skram> besides
08:18:47 <Micen_> a corrupt warmonger or a crazy rich man

22:30:07 <Dot`> im too lazy to write it out
22:33:04 <Dot`> i got one that was a teifling paladin who believes plate armour is just a sign of being posh and over privlidged
22:38:09 <Phearlock> nice =D
22:38:30 <skram> sounds about right
22:38:36 <skram> what you really want is a nice suit
22:40:02 <Phearlock> A sufficiently high magical armor bonus is indistinguishable from plate armor.
22:40:27 <Dot`> better, no stupid stealth disadvatage
