15:15:17 <Camail> moo
15:15:27 <DoT`> I did actually forget short swords are finesse weapons
15:15:55 <Camail> yup thats a thing
15:19:30 <DoT`> but i do 1d6 unarmed strike at 5th level and at 11th 1D8
15:19:51 <DoT`> so while 11th is FAR away, it still puts a time limit on using the weapon
15:19:58 <DoT`> and therefore the stat

15:22:07 <Camail> i dont get it
15:22:11 <Camail> you can still hold the weapon
15:22:15 <Camail> and choose not to use it
15:22:31 <Camail> at 11th level your prof is +4 i think
15:22:37 <Camail> so thats +4 ac
15:23:13 <DoT`> from the date you gave the message to sweetie about short swords to pass on, I assume its connected to the defence dualist feat discusion
15:23:23 <Camail> yea
15:23:28 <Camail> thats wh I'm saying +4
15:23:40 <Camail> at 11th level you might not be using the weapon toa ttack
15:23:47 <Camail> but it would basically just be a +2 shield
15:23:57 <DoT`> i can hold a sword in my hands and still use unarmed strike instead o the sword attack?
15:24:01 <Camail> yes
15:24:11 <Camail> you can dual wield and still unarmed strike
15:24:15 <Camail> because its not just punches
15:24:34 <Camail> headbutts, kicks elbows, shoulders, all unarmed strikes
15:24:38 <DoT`> I did not realise this, tohugh i know unarmed includes elbows.knees/kicks
15:24:45 <Camail> I've said it multiple times :P
15:24:54 <Yolteotl> DoT, stream is back!
15:24:57 <DoT`> i did not realise i could just hold the swords
15:25:12 <Camail> yea you dont have to attack with the things in your hands
15:25:13 <DoT`> you talked about dropping and picking up the things every round
15:25:22 <Camail> that was the main thing yes
15:25:27 <DoT`> thats the thing i was eh about
15:25:32 <Camail> that was an optimization
15:25:38 <DoT`> this other side of it i never got
15:25:42 <DoT`> i missed it
15:25:48 <Camail> I said that stuff before the dagger stuff
15:25:53 <DoT`> ah
15:25:57 <Camail> like 2-3 days before dagges ever came up
15:26:01 <Camail> daggers*
15:26:28 <DoT`> I dont recall being around for that conversation
15:26:34 <DoT`> oh well
15:26:41 <Camail> the reason unarmed strikes are so versatile isb ecause for most people its just 1+str
15:26:55 <Camail> but for brawlers and monks you get a huge boon
15:27:51 <Camail> so by lvl 5 you would have no reason to even go up close to someone
15:27:58 <Camail> unless you ahd a good magic weapon
15:28:11 <DoT`> yea
15:28:41 <CockRoach|42> DoT`: that is a very fancy looking snek :O
15:28:45 <Camail> also i wanna point out that yesterday you did more damage than anyone else
15:29:00 <Camail> and you didnt even use ki points
15:29:25 <DoT`> i did notice, i need to maths more it seems
15:29:41 <DoT`> or my rolls where just good in fights, because they where useless EVERYWHERE else
15:29:41 <Camail> also believe in urself pls
15:29:53 <Camail> you were trying things you werent good at
15:29:58 <Camail> you arent good at investigation
15:30:01 <Camail> you are good at insight
15:30:06 <DoT`> 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 
15:30:06 <Camail> but you almost never did insight checks
15:30:28 <DoT`> i did an insight to see if that guy was a pretnetious dick! and i was right
15:30:43 <Camail> that...yes you did
15:30:52 <DoT`> i do need to use it more
15:31:13 <Camail> translate your suspicions to the game
15:31:18 <DoT`> \but you keep telling me stats dont matter, its only a -1 to invvestigation
15:31:28 <DoT`> it was just bad rolls
15:31:43 <Camail> yea but someone with +3 int and prof in ivnestigation has +5
15:31:46 <Camail> thats 6 difference
15:31:49 <Camail> which is a lot
15:31:51 <DoT`> yes
15:31:55 <Camail> stats don't matter in combat
15:31:57 <Camail> because you cang et adv
15:32:17 <Camail> you can also get afv for skill checks but its not as obvious
15:32:19 <Camail> adv*
15:32:37 <Camail> its more of a puzzle than a strategy to do that
15:32:58 <Camail> maybe an insight check will be easier if you say the right thing, I change the DC depending on context
15:33:13 <Camail> many investigation check have a hard limit set by the book itself
15:33:24 <Camail> but then you might want to encourage everyone to help check things out
15:33:43 <Camail> there are decisions you can make as a player to negate stats, yes
15:34:14 <DoT`> well a fair number of the checks i do even if im bad at are to point other party member to do it
15:34:29 <Camail> but that doesn't mean that stats are irrelevant, can't just take the direct approach and force it
15:34:41 <Camail> do you ever say "hey can someone help me check this out"
15:35:09 <Camail> aiding almost any skill check is easy
15:35:20 <DoT`> well there hasnt been need for that yet, but should maye try it more
15:35:28 <DoT`> terran Yolteotl pls
15:35:33 <Yolteotl> :(
15:35:35 <Yolteotl> zerg op
15:35:35 <Yolteotl> :p
15:36:03 <DoT`> ultas are really scary
15:36:07 <Yolteotl> imba pause :(
15:36:15 <Camail> dont be so quick to assume you've seen everything you needed to see
15:37:34 <DoT`> if i roll badly for something lke investigating a corpse I think its wrong for me to THEN ask someone else to check, as i as the character wouldnt know that i did bad in sometihng like that
15:37:41 <DoT`> but I am maybe looking at it wrong?
15:37:59 <Camail> correct, you dont meta your roll quality
15:38:21 <Camail> but you also know, as a character, you aren't very good at deduction and investigation, you often miss things other people see
15:38:39 <Camail> so before that happens, before you commit to any rolls, you can talk about it
15:39:23 <Camail> most people can asses themselves and gauge their strength
15:39:32 <Camail> unless one of your flaws is that you think you're better than you are at something
15:39:42 <Camail> then I'd say you understand yourself, especially as a monk
15:40:00 <Camail> with a high wisdom, your empathy and like understand is strong
15:40:15 <Camail> you know that about yourself, how you express it is up to you
15:40:38 <DoT`> hmm, yea
15:40:38 <Camail> your empathy and life experience*
15:40:46 <DoT`> yolt, how many terrans left?
15:45:36 <Yolteotl> polt?
15:45:43 <DoT`> only 1?
15:48:22 <Camail> rip
15:48:34 <DoT`> terran needs to build more walls
15:50:23 <DoT`> by the fact skram can talk to animals we can make an assumption of what path he chose then
15:50:37 <DoT`> or he multicallsed druid
15:51:07 <DoT`> Jonas, are you now an elvish tree hugger?
15:51:11 <skram> did you try asking
15:51:28 <DoT`> not during the session, but before i did
15:51:33 <DoT`> and you didnt awnser
15:51:40 <skram> yes im multiclassing druid now
15:51:45 <DoT`> ok
15:54:21 <Camail> DoT`  maybe? you don't know much about barbarians, depends on what he shares
15:54:28 <Camail> they also dont know what you're doing either
15:54:35 <Camail> because you havent used elemental stuff
15:55:31 <DoT`> none of us even know that bardum is magic, he might just be losing at and talking to birds
15:55:39 <Camail> I'd want to get to lvl 5 in something before multiclassing, personally
15:55:40 <DoT`> losing it*
15:55:42 <Camail> just tog et a 2nd attack

17:37:37 <Camail> I'm becoming more of a fan of the traditional stat array
17:38:09 <Camail> i guess it depends on the player
17:38:10 <DoT`> which is? the set number soyu place?
17:38:19 <Camail> 15,14,13,12,10,8
17:38:24 <Camail> but its just me personally
17:38:30 <Camail> i dunno how i like about giving it toa  party
17:38:45 <Camail> many players need encouragement to make interesting characters
17:39:48 <Camail> its a tough call, need to think about it all more
17:39:57 <Camail> though i gave the choice to phear and dub and neither took it\
