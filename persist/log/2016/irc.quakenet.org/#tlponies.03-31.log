09:07:14 <DoT`> i fell asleep last night with a kindle in front of me, i have no idea what page its taken me too >.>
09:08:15 <Phearlock> lol
09:08:22 <DoT`> there are many reasons i prefer actual books haha
09:08:22 <Phearlock> BOOK ADVENTURE
09:14:02 <Rawr|Phone> If you fall asleep with an open book in front of you, it's probably not going to be on the same page when you wake up dot
09:15:17 <Rawr|Phone> Well, I guess it depends
09:15:36 <DoT`> but at least its easier to find your page again as well
09:19:33 <Rawr|Phone> Maybe
09:19:44 <Rawr|Phone> I have never used a kindle
09:22:16 <DoT`> its far easier to pirate books with one
09:24:26 <Phearlock> Or read fanfics on the go
09:24:28 <Phearlock> =P

11:50:24 <Micen> stream was good
11:50:39 <Micen> finished inking that luna i started last stream 
11:50:44 <Micen> then got distracted 
11:51:15 <Micen> by trying to figure out some armor for Luna. 
11:51:20 <Micen> so i did some mockups 
11:51:21 <DoT`> nice
11:51:30 <DoT`> you said never do armour :P
11:51:33 <Micen> then i realized i hate armor
11:51:34 <DoT`> i lke armour
11:51:54 <Micen> it looks nice, its just hard to come up with something that fits. 
11:52:07 <Micen> and not in my wheelhouse for things I can draw (yet)
11:52:34 <Micen> that mostly consists of ponies and things that are vaugely pony shaped.

16:32:45 <Phearlock> such aim
16:33:25 <skram> :D
16:34:41 <DuB`> I have heard three differen't people say "wary" as "weary" in the last few day.s
16:34:45 <DuB`> Pls.
16:35:00 <skram> English is dumb, dub.
16:35:12 <DuB`> No, people are!
16:35:16 <DuB`> Grr!
16:35:17 <skram> like pronouncing lead as lead
16:35:20 <skram> or read as read
16:35:28 <DuB`> That's different.
16:36:06 <Golly> context isnt exactly an english phenomenon
16:36:14 <DuB`> Weary and wary look different, sound different, and have entirely unrelated meaning!
16:37:18 <DuB`> I like Japanese, where most everything is a homonym with something else and half the sentence is just left up to context and goes unsaid.
16:37:22 <Golly> the one that annoys me is loose and lose
16:37:24 <DuB`> :P
16:38:48 <skram> or people who write "must of" when they mean "must have"
16:40:54 <DuB`> KILL.
16:41:30 <DuB`> They should be summarily executed, skram.
16:41:34 <Phearlock> I'll second Golly. loose/lose is so annoying xD
16:42:03 <skram> I agree, dub
16:42:42 <DuB`> :)
16:42:53 <DuB`> Also yay, electricity bill came.
16:42:56 <DuB`> :T
16:43:05 <skram> whoo. bills.
16:43:44 <skram> You can have some of my bills if you like them so much?
16:43:58 <DuB`> Oke.
16:44:21 <DuB`> I'd only spend the money on food and other bills, anyway..
16:44:30 <skram> :D
16:46:18 <DoT`> or on opening crates
16:46:34 <DuB`> Never again.
16:46:40 <DoT`> haha

17:30:39 <DuB`> I'm about the same weight now.
17:30:54 <DuB`> But... I haven't exercised since last semester, so a LOT less of it is fit weight.

23:27:58 <Camail> risky timing
23:28:12 <Bio> did he get the window to cat jump?
23:29:12 <Bio> how did no one check bench
23:29:25 <Camail> there were a lot of places to check
23:29:31 <Camail> and he waited for the defuse
23:29:50 <Camail> could've been bench, van, or cat
23:30:00 <Bio> yeh
23:30:21 <Camail> safest bet was cat

23:47:30 <Camail> N vs S
23:48:33 <skram> honestly dont see tl beat lg
23:48:40 <Camail> astralis vs fnatic
23:48:52 <skram> fnatic probably
23:49:07 <Camail> that's what we always have to say
23:49:17 <skram> because they almost always win
23:49:44 <Camail> yea
23:50:28 <Camail> its weird
23:50:34 <Camail> every team other than fnatic seem to be in flux
23:50:48 <Camail> eu used to have like 4 solid teams that were in their own league
23:52:02 <skram> hmm
23:52:57 <skram> Well id say that both navi and astralis are pretty steady but fnatic has been in a league of its own for like 1.5 years now
23:53:11 <Camail> nv was right by them for half a year
23:53:18 <skram> yeah
23:53:19 <Camail> ldlc months included
23:53:35 <skram> no idea what happened there
23:53:43 <Camail> team broke apart at the seams
23:53:48 <Camail> i think they hat each other
23:53:51 <Camail> hate*
23:54:25 <Camail> i bet skadoodle is sad he left hiko in the dust for c9 lol
23:54:49 <Camail> not gonna lie, replace stewie with adren pls
23:54:57 <skram> is it because kioshima left
23:55:03 <Camail> stewie is so new and bad he doesnt even have a dependable role
23:55:10 <Camail> kio leaving was a symptom
23:55:13 <Camail> not a cause
23:55:18 <skram> maybe
23:55:19 <Camail> even look at his statement
23:55:22 <Camail> he didnt want to be there
