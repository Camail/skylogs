22:47:20 <skram> you made a wiki?
22:47:27 <Camail> no
22:47:30 <Camail> it exists
22:47:34 <skram> oh
22:47:35 <skram> i see
22:54:04 <ZK> camail really likes us and made a wiki for our questions :o
22:54:26 <ZK> eh fuck factions for now
22:54:34 <Camail> yea they aren't vital
22:54:42 <Camail> but they have some interactions
22:54:51 <Camail> so i felt it was necessary to at least expose you guys to them
22:55:04 <Camail> they will exist in the world tho, regardless of if you hook into them
22:55:09 <ZK> true, knowing about them should be useful
22:57:02 <ZK> http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/story/factions
22:57:05 <ZK> i prefer this reference personally
22:57:31 <DoT`> so cam, https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/3sf2xs/homebrew_way_of_the_four_elements_monk_remastered/
22:58:01 <Camail> is this what you want to use
22:58:54 <DoT`> i like the look of the rework, they nerf a few things and add vairty, but i know full well i dont have the experience to know if its well balanced
22:59:02 <DoT`> the comments seem to indicate it is
23:01:35 <Camail> dot wants to be a sorcerer but with fists
23:01:42 <DoT`> how much am i suppose to read about factions? is it not info we must find out as a character
23:02:09 <ZK> thats ok, i want to be a warlock with daggers
23:02:12 <Camail> your character probably wont know most of it, just read the intro
23:02:19 <DoT`> ok
23:02:29 <Camail> its just general history tho
23:02:59 <Camail> so depending on your history checks and background you'll know things
23:03:16 <Camail> but so far it seems the bonuses from being in a faction aren't very interactive
23:03:20 <Camail> so its like w/e
23:03:34 <Camail> but i didnt want to waste potential content if someone wanted to be part of a faction
23:04:35 <Camail> dot did you pick a token yet
23:04:42 <Camail> the answer is no because you ahvent given me one
23:04:43 <ZK> im only 19 and been in the woods for 100 years, havent gotten time to pick a faction
23:04:43 <Camail> gimme
23:04:46 <Camail> u fuk
23:04:51 <DoT`> NO
23:04:55 <Camail> u fukkkk
23:05:00 <DoT`> i will draw a stick figure
23:05:06 <Camail> i will draw a dick on it
23:05:20 <DoT`> collaberation!
23:05:36 <DoT`> micen, will you colour it?
23:06:01 <ZK> hey cam, if you want i can just give you a pic of real life DoT`, and that's gonna be his token
23:06:07 <ZK> then you can draw a dick on it
23:06:10 <Camail> i will draw a dick on it
23:06:33 <DoT`> there is no such tihng as a picture of me
23:06:58 <Camail> dot i dunno, I'm gonna need to read this 
23:07:07 <DoT`> sure
23:07:08 <Camail> they buffed fangs of the fire strike a lot
23:07:20 <ZK> what age you char DoT`?
23:07:27 <ZK> young old?
23:07:30 <DoT`> i will probably got four elements either way
23:07:30 <DoT`> 72
23:07:32 <Camail> they moved the ki cost to just the burn damage and give you the +5 melee range for free
23:07:36 <skram> the oldest dot
23:08:32 <DoT`> oh really? i missed that cam, i read 1 extra ki to cause fire
23:08:52 <Camail> well
23:08:56 <DoT`> per attack you wanted to add it to
23:08:59 <Camail> it doesnt explicitly say to spend 1 ki point to do that
23:09:05 <Camail> while the official docs say at the beginning
23:09:10 <Camail> so they intentionally removed that part

23:11:11 <Camail> its only mentioned once
23:11:17 <Camail> then not mentioned at all int he palyers handbook
23:11:28 <DoT`> your good at art zk
23:11:51 <DoT`> if you see it refers to ee
23:12:00 <DoT`> http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/EE_PlayersCompanion.pdf
23:12:09 <zedkay> he looks kind of unassuming, which I think would be good for a monk
23:12:23 <DoT`> yea, its a bit much cam, im not sure i trust it after the free 5 foot range
23:12:46 <ZK> isnt 5 foot range same as close?
23:12:56 <DoT`> it adds an extra 5
23:13:05 <Camail> I'll have to think about it and read more
23:13:08 <Camail> there's a lot to go through
23:13:13 <Camail> because its not just aobut level 3
23:14:02 <DoT`> i liked the tihngs they did like with water whip
23:14:03 <DoT`> On a failed save,
23:14:03 <DoT`> the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your
23:14:03 <DoT`> Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier,
23:14:12 <DoT`> instead of 3d10
23:14:56 <DoT`> that kind of change seemed more balanced to me
23:16:51 <DoT`> but have a look, if it does turn out to be balanced, great, as it adds a nice vairity, if not, oh well
23:18:19 <DoT`> cam says yes -> pick way of the open hand instead -> killed by dragon
23:19:58 <Camail> like i said before, if you cross me i won't even grant you a cool death
23:20:10 <ZK> awww shit.
23:20:17 <Camail> it will be so pitiful, such a meaningless death that your memory will instantly vanish from your family and friends
23:20:19 <ZK> im gonna die in a bed in the night
23:20:40 <ZK> from brain aneurysm
23:20:56 <ZK> cause i was having so much fun with Kyle!
23:22:30 <DoT`> probably die of infection from a rusty nail scratch
23:23:15 <Camail> ok so
23:23:42 <Camail> I beleive the intent was that it is implied that activating a discipline requires a ki point
23:23:47 <Camail> so they just dont ever say that ever
23:24:03 <Camail> because this is homebrew by a guy who read he entire PHB twice, probably
23:25:03 <Camail> hmmmm
23:25:06 <Camail> maybe not?
23:25:42 <Camail> fist of unbroken air seems to just give to 15 feet melee range?
23:25:53 <Camail> i really need to figure out what logical structure this pdf is assuming
23:26:21 <DoT`> like if you look at effortless step, i can see that even though its not stated, you can assuemt to have to use a ki in order to do anything listed in it
23:28:29 <Camail> but then he does this "As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to choose an area
23:28:29 <Camail> of ice or water"
23:28:33 <DoT`> oh cam, fist of unbroken air, does no damage
23:28:49 <Camail> yes they do
23:28:56 <Camail> its just you cant scale up te damage
23:29:01 <Camail> it does normal unarmed strike damage
23:29:03 <skram> can i make my own faction
23:29:06 <Camail> no
23:29:07 <skram> with hookers and blackjack
23:29:12 <skram> fuck
23:29:15 <Camail> forget the blackjack
23:29:16 <Camail> and yes
23:29:21 <Camail> oh wait not
23:29:27 <Camail> forget the faction too
23:30:05 <DoT`> well in the reddit thread i linked the op says
23:30:08 <DoT`> " My current version of Fist of Unbroken Air doesn't do any damage."
23:30:27 <DoT`> in reply to a question saying it looks op
23:31:02 <skram> I dont think any of these factions make sense with what ive planned Camail
23:31:17 <Camail> thats fine
23:31:31 <Camail> guess you just have to rework your background to fit my prep
23:31:33 <Camail> too bad for you
23:31:35 <Camail> dm rules
23:31:39 <Camail> dm rulez
23:31:51 <skram> or what?
23:32:00 <skram> you gonna kill me with some level 20 mosquitos
23:32:08 <ZK> doestn ahve to be level 20
23:32:34 <skram> i wanna say that i could take a level 5 mosquito but i dont want to give cam ideas
23:32:49 <Camail> yea dot I'll allow it, provided that we're both in agreement that you need to use a ki point to manifest a discipline, other than the ones that are just "use x point to cast [spell]"
23:33:16 <Camail> then you just use the x points without needing to use another 1 point at the beginning
23:33:28 <ZK> woohooo for homebrew
23:33:30 <Camail> like gong of the summity just costs 2 ki points to cast shatter
23:34:38 <Camail> tfw dot will never make skram's body quiver with his palm
23:34:48 <Camail> so much slash fiction gone to waste
23:35:02 <DoT`> i can still set him on fire
23:35:12 <skram> ill just throw him at stuff
23:35:13 <ZK> i can set his loins on fire
23:35:22 <skram> you wish, elf
23:36:10 <DoT`> so cam, to clarify if i use Fangs of the fire snake, in order to get the 5 feet extra i  spend a ki and my attacks count as flaming
23:36:15 <ZK> its ok, i dont really want to do kids
23:36:25 <DoT`> i can then spend an extra ki to do 1d10 extra fire
23:36:55 <DoT`> that spells wording needs work
23:37:41 <Camail> yes dot
23:38:17 <DoT`> ok, that also pretty much lines up with how it is originaly
23:38:20 <DoT`> so it makes sense
23:38:42 <Camail> yea its weird
23:38:50 <Camail> cuz with our interpretation is seems like a shit ability
23:39:00 <Camail> unless you can start pumping it with ki points at lvl 5
23:39:04 <Camail> which i guess works
23:39:08 <Camail> because you get more faster, right
23:39:56 <Camail> where are the cantrips listed
23:39:58 <DoT`> so like with other spells, +1 ki dropped into it +1d10 damage
23:40:06 <DoT`> in the EE
23:40:14 <DoT`> they seem basicly the same
23:40:17 <Camail> oh i tohught he was saying that was also a remaster
23:40:21 <DoT`> you just dont get them all at once
23:40:36 <DoT`> you cant light fires anymore form nothing
23:40:41 <DoT`> so minor changes
23:41:46 <Camail> what cantrips do you get, I'm not seeing where thats explained
23:41:55 <DoT`> and that is a nice unasumming pic for a token zk
23:42:06 <Camail> the ee suppliment doesnt have a monk section for me
23:42:51 <ZK> oh wow, had never realized libeartors actually do say "got freedom" in their lines
23:42:52 <ZK> cute
23:43:03 <Camail> oh
23:43:06 <Camail> found it
23:43:26 <Camail> dot wants to be a bender
23:44:08 <DoT`> well i have a choice of Bruce lee, edgelord ninja assassin, or avatar
23:44:14 <DoT`> haha
23:46:29 <Camail> oh ok i figured him out
23:46:46 <Camail> unbroken air costs 2 ki to both be used fully, he says
23:46:59 <Camail> and it only ever mentions 1 ki spent for the optional part
23:47:04 <Camail> so the first ki for the range is implied
23:47:24 <DoT`> ok
23:47:44 <Camail> so i guess the other disciplines written like that follow the same assumption
23:49:13 <Camail> dot there is a very real chance you will never make it to being the avatar
23:49:20 <Camail> you need to emotionally cope with that fact
23:49:27 <DoT`> you look at way of shadow and its 2 ki for its spells, free to teleport, invis and oppertunity attacks
23:50:00 <Camail> honestly my efforts have been less concerned with its blance and more concerned with its consistency atm
23:50:05 <DoT`> my headset has a long cable, i can curl up into a corner and not have to get off discord
23:50:15 <Camail> rip
23:50:25 <Camail> also if you pick the air cantrip
23:50:29 <Camail> I'm making your pic aang
23:50:33 <Camail> he's a kid, ur a halfling
23:50:35 <DoT`> LOL
23:50:36 <Camail> same height
23:50:41 <DoT`> i have not read that one
23:50:52 <Camail> they are all about elemental manipulation
23:51:00 <Camail> and its one for each element so yea
23:51:03 <Camail> i ahvent even read it
23:51:10 <Camail> but i will make that ur token regardless
23:52:48 <Camail> this is also an option http://img03.deviantart.net/278d/i/2015/047/e/b/commission__crota_by_olieboldador-d8i8a1s.jpg
23:54:38 <DoT`> well no where in the air one does it say i can fly with a glider using it
23:54:40 <DoT`> pointless
23:54:55 <Camail> rip
23:55:13 <skram> bro you are not a freakin air bender
23:55:27 <Camail> man, the token i picked for you and this one are the only non-shitty pictures of a halfling monk on DA
23:56:00 <Camail> not a very common section of the venn diagram, i guess
23:56:06 <DoT`> zk linked this one https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/b3/73/c3/b373c3a9436533d872b21196cb29ec14.jpg

23:56:48 <skram> its like a tramp stamp only on the front
23:56:48 <DoT`> not sunbutt
23:56:48 <Camail> nothing but dot has serious commitment issues
23:57:21 <DoT`> abandonment does that cam!

23:57:40 <Camail> actively not abandoning you

23:58:27 <skram> fuck 'im, ill be your daddy
23:59:04 <DoT`> i expect more carrying to occur then
23:59:13 <Camail> also dot i believe your spell dc is what you use for checks on the spells your getting
23:59:20 <skram> you can sit on my shoulders while i bash faces
23:59:22 <Camail> so like, gust is a str check for them, 
23:59:23 <skram> i can rp alchemist
23:59:37 <Camail> it doesnt exactly say what the dc is so it must be dynamic, and explained under standard spellcasting
23:59:51 <DoT`> makes sense cam
23:59:57 <Camail> which is all calculated in your spell modifier thing ont he spells page
23:59:58 <Camail> i believe
