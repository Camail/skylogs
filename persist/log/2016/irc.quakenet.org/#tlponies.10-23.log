00:02:48 <Micen> I return
00:02:56 <skram> hello micen
00:03:02 <Camail> wow skram settle down
00:03:08 <Camail> ur clams are all over the floor
00:03:24 <Micen> I need you all to cheer for the Cubs. One game from going to the world series.
00:04:22 <skram> i dont know who that is micen
00:05:21 <Camail> its a team whee all the fans are losers
00:05:24 <Camail> literally all of them
00:05:32 <skram> rude
00:05:38 <Camail> its just fact
00:05:43 <Camail> baseball lvoes stats
00:05:50 <Camail> and this is the biggest stat in sports history
00:06:02 <Micen> This is true, but we can hope.
00:06:03 <Bio> can't kill the stats
00:06:12 <Camail> they're about to break a losing streak thats as old as world war 2
00:06:36 <Camail> hitler had a better chance of being alive to see a winning cubs team than any of us
00:08:51 <Micen> 108 years since a world series win, 71 since winning the pennant. and Cam, at least Chicago has its hockey which I guess makes up for that.
00:09:39 <Camail> I live in illinois i dont have a choice whether i know about the cubs or not
00:09:44 <Camail> wgn forces that on me
00:16:30 <Micen> You say this like its a bad thing Cam 
00:16:48 <Camail> its just a force of nature, really
00:16:58 <Camail> can't get mad at a forest fire
00:20:50 <Bio> Fuck fires tho
00:32:09 <Camail> hey it might not be the best soccer team
00:32:11 <Camail> but they try
00:32:30 <Camail> Micen  lul you are probably pretty happy already
00:33:50 <Micen> Yeah
00:34:17 <Micen> up 2 already and not even out of the first, with a runner on third.
00:40:19 <Camail> gonna ask my brother how fucked up chicago gets once the cubs win
00:40:28 <Camail> there will be 1+ riot
