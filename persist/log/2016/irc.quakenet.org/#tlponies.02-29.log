23:29:24 <Camail> dub pls
23:29:30 <DoT`> Dingy souls
23:29:38 <DuB`> I was playing a sort of genji/hanzo hybrid in a deathmatch on a D3 act4-inspired map.
23:29:53 <Camail> holy shit ur such a nerd
23:30:01 <DoT`> haha wow dub
23:30:06 <DuB`> T_T
23:30:18 <DuB`> I was really good, though.
23:30:20 <DuB`> That was fun.
23:30:57 <Camail> seriously tho try not to get over hyped about any game
23:31:07 <Camail> and i consider ahving multiple dreams about it as over hyped
23:31:17 <Camail> i think thats a fair assessment
23:31:22 <DuB`> ... probably.
23:31:40 <DuB`> Will put some time into figuring what on earth I'm doing in SFV this week/weekend.
23:31:54 <Camail> I'm not even saying u should play my games
23:32:03 <Camail> just like...you are setting yourself up for sadness
23:32:15 <Camail> overwatch isnt jesus incarnate
23:32:22 <DuB`> Drat.
23:32:33 <Camail> its gonna be great but like, no revelations or ascension happening
23:33:06 <DuB`> I dunno mang, genji's voice lines are pretty divine.
23:33:23 <Camail> also everyone is gonna want to play genji
23:33:29 <DuB`> Yeah...
