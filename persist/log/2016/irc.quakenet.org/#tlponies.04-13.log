09:43:14 <Runbunny> Don't worry Cane, I have died many times before.
09:43:38 <Cane> Lynda and Micen. Thank you for your service. Your world would remember you if this wasn't a secret operation.
09:43:57 <CockRoach|42> am i still alive?
09:47:43 <Cane> I don't remember if I had you. If I do, you're home with a cold, eating soup and watching teletubbies.
09:47:51 <Cane> Two people are out with injuries.
09:47:59 <Cane> So I'm going into this terror mission 2 people down to begin with.
09:48:10 <Cane> And then there are four cyberdiscs and enemies up the ass.
09:51:40 <Cane> Three smoke grenades down, we'll see how many people they save.
09:57:56 <CockRoach|42> i'm ok with that :)

12:47:40 <Cane> Yeah, this mission's a bust.
12:49:14 <Cane> Damn, skram just wrecked one.
12:49:24 <Cane> Blaze of glory probably, the other THREE are going to destroy us.
12:51:03 <Cane> Bio you sick, sick man.
12:51:16 <Cane> You shot a goddamned rocket out of a tiny window from pretty far away and saved notbob's ass.
12:51:29 <Cane> skram, notbob, and three civilians would have been dead.
12:51:41 <Cane> And DuB.
12:51:54 <Cane> So instead of dying this turn, everyone will die NEXT turn.
12:53:18 <Cane> WELP. There goes Camail.
12:53:24 <Cane> We got flanked.
12:57:52 <Rawr|Fone> Game is hard
12:59:25 <Cane> skram exploded.
12:59:30 <Cane> He went down swinging.
12:59:38 <Cane> Let's see if Phearlock can save us.
13:04:49 <Cane> Duuuuuub, nooooo.
13:08:41 <Cane> Whitewing died, Bio is now a panicked wreck.
13:09:39 <Cane> motbob jumped out blaze-of-glory style, lobbed two grenades at the last cyberdisc, and is now running the fuck away!
13:13:16 <Cane> Holy shit Rawr, you and Phearlock can do this. Maybe.
13:13:29 <Rawr|Fone> Of course
13:14:25 <Cane> notbob's down.
13:15:50 <Cane> Bio, in a panic, is running AT the cyberdisc.
13:17:39 <Cane> Phearlock killed the last cyberdisc! There's still sectoids around though.
13:19:29 <Bio> i'm trying to be a big damn hero
13:19:34 <Cane> Hahahah it didn't work Bio.
13:19:41 <Bio> >trying
13:19:51 <Cane> You drew their fire pretty well?
13:19:55 <Cane> I guess that counts for something.
13:20:04 <Cane> Phearlock lone survivor.
13:20:24 <Bio> rip
13:20:25 <Cane> Raelcun and CockRoach were home sick so they're still there.
13:20:36 <Cane> We lost EVERYONE.
13:20:47 <Bio> thats xcom baby
13:21:49 <Cane> Ordered 12 more troops.
13:22:04 <Cane> Phearlock somehow clinched the mission so I didn't get a massive terror spike.
13:24:57 <Cane> Hahaha woah.
13:25:12 <Cane> So, reinforcements have arrived, time to name them. One of them is a supersoldier with the worst bravery score I've ever seen.
13:25:52 <Cane> Lots of movement points, throwing accuracy, stamina, firing accuracy, but they WILL piss themselves in combat.

14:42:00 <Cane> You've got a ton of stamina and great throwing accuracy.
14:42:15 <Cane> Not very brave, but since you're likely to die first, that doesn't matter so much.
14:42:27 <DoT`> then dub can try to not shoot me in the back of the head
14:42:31 <DoT`> good plan
14:42:34 <Cane> Just remember to kneel so DuB can shoot over you.
14:42:49 <Pearlock> Amazing I lived so long last time lol
14:43:01 <Cane> You + DuB is a good combo. You with the smoke grenade on the ramp, you go down first and scout, then DuB comes out and shoots everything in the face with his 70 accuracy.
14:43:13 <Pearlock> In my campaigns it's always the guys who get the luckiest shots that get unluckily crit from across the map shortly after
14:43:15 <Cane> Pearlock, you were the best one. You actually solo'd that terror mission towards the end, but we was fucked anyway.
14:43:17 <DuB`> pewpewpew
14:43:17 <Bio> ?saved
14:43:24 <DoT`> kneeling is for cowards cane! i kneel for no one!
14:43:50 <Pearlock> But you shoot better while kneeling
14:43:59 <DoT`> honour!
14:46:56 <Pearlock> In Xcom: Long war I always hoarded the people with the best shooty+health stats as infantry as they were my favorite class
14:47:09 <reification> .tell rawr https://twitter.com/evemassacre/status/701023673134792704
14:47:26 <Pearlock> And then ofc my infantry always outperformed everyone else.
14:47:36 <Pearlock> And I felt justified in it being the best class.
14:47:46 <Pearlock> What a nice feedback circle it was
14:48:02 <Pearlock> (that was such a good class in LW though omg)
14:49:14 <Bio> infantry so gud
14:49:17 <Bio> many bullet

15:05:03 <Bio> do you run faster when holding it
15:06:13 <DuB`> :O
15:06:17 <DuB`> I haven't tried!
15:06:18 <DuB`> Probly.
15:06:44 <Bio> be sure to spin it around a bunch then inspect it randomly
15:07:14 <DuB`> This is gonna take some practice.
15:07:27 <DoT`> please dont lose any important fingers

15:30:37 <Bio> T_T
15:31:40 <Cane> Bio, I'll give you the second one once the new recruits come in. Everyone in this current group is a weakling and only Reif and Phear can even hold anything heavier than a rifle.
15:31:49 <Cane> So Phear is back on his heavy cannon and Reif gets a rocket launcher because nobody else can.
15:31:50 <Cane> Pussies.
15:32:03 <Bio> only the worlds best soldiers
15:32:13 <Cane> Like DuB. He's my best marksman, but he *can't carry the best weapons*.
15:32:32 <carcinisation> this is why it's important to lift :p

15:37:28 <Cane> Dub is such a sniper. Two floater kills already.
15:38:17 <Cane> OH DEARS. Welp, Golly's out with an injury on the third turn of the game.
15:38:33 <Pearlock> Better than being out due to not breathing anymore
15:39:23 <Cane> You all suck! There's ONE FLOATER and you can't hit him!
15:39:42 <DoT`> let me throw a smoke at its face
15:39:58 <Golly> you expect me to perform when i have a splinter in my finger?
15:40:00 <Cane> Deal. Lemme prime a grenade.
15:40:19 <DuB`> Dot is new rock-thrower?
15:40:35 <DoT`> i think my only job is smoke grenade throwing dub
15:40:53 <DoT`> and then bullet sponge so you can kill things 
15:40:58 <DuB`> What a friend.
15:41:04 <DoT`> its like CS
15:41:07 <DoT`> :P
15:41:25 <DoT`> now we just need you to kill things
15:41:38 <DuB`> Yeeaaaah that would be an important bit.
15:41:44 <Cane> Looks like Golly got the splinter out.
15:41:46 <Cane> Nice shot dude.
15:43:40 <Golly> ehh, just as intended im sure
15:43:47 <Golly> not random at all no sir-ee
15:45:14 <Cane> Poor Golly. At least you killed two floater bastards. It's a man's death.
15:45:22 <DuB`> D:
15:45:29 <DuB`> RIP
15:45:46 <Golly> lol, i thought i was supposed to be the cowardliest
15:45:51 <Cane> DuB`, congrats, you're a sergeant.
15:46:42 * DuB` climbs up on top of Golly's corpse to better look down upon the lowly non-sergeants surrounding him.
15:46:45 <DuB`> Hmm, hmm.
15:47:03 <DoT`> golly was always the rock in our squad
15:47:19 <Cane> Sniff, it's true.
15:47:25 <Pearlock> Always = the first mission
15:47:35 <Golly> so thats why you made me wear the red shirt
15:47:58 <Cane> Reinforcements are here. Golly, do you have a brother or other relative who's eager to avenge you?
15:48:22 <DuB`> "Blood? Naw, that's just the normal color of your shirt. Man up."
15:48:29 <Golly> i guess my brother Howard would do
15:48:40 <DoT`> Sir Gollifreed the third
15:48:42 <Golly> aka H√•vard
15:49:19 <Cane> Done. H√•vard is a beast with a gun and has a lot of action points.
15:49:28 <Cane> I'll give him a giant auto cannon and some HE rounds.
15:50:16 <Golly> he would want no less
15:50:26 <Cane> Oh wow, someone with bravery 10.
15:50:26 <DoT`> 25mm revenge delivery system
15:50:38 <DoT`> FREK

16:00:23 <DoT`> this cant go wrong
16:00:56 <Cane> And Bio with the medium rocket launcher.
16:01:11 <Cane> What the hell. You can have HE grenades too.
16:04:16 <DoT`> so everyone is runnign around with explosives attached and bio has a rocket launcher aka explosives detonator
16:04:29 <DoT`> i see where this is going
16:18:13 <Golly> why does cs need so many analysts
16:18:25 <Golly> their "work" seems to consist of talking shit
16:18:28 <DuB`> Boardalands boardalands boardalands 
16:18:55 <carcinisation> if you could get paid for talking shit about video games wouldn't you do it?
16:18:58 <DuB`> I've noticed there is a LOT of talking, golly. 
16:19:08 <Golly> sure, but why do they pay them
16:20:04 <DuB`> People need help in knowing what opinion to have about the video games? 
16:21:00 <Bio> mainly because people want esperts to be realsperts
16:21:50 <DuB`> But they forget that we already have things that realsports don't have, like fancy gunskins and flipknives!
16:22:08 <DuB`> And esports dubstep.
16:23:35 <Golly> maybe the filler inbetween matches is more important than i realize
16:24:41 <DuB`> I guess if setting up / prepping matches really does take this long then it's better than nothing.
16:28:44 <Bio> better than staring at a timer
16:28:52 <Bio> and its fun to establish storylines
16:29:04 <carcinisation> well i just played heads up vs one of the worst and luckiest player i've seen...

18:59:04 <Raelcun_> why would you do this
18:59:29 <Camail> did I die?
18:59:48 <Cane> You and Phear are butt buddies. Phearlock has sick aim so he's walking around with a heavy cannon, and you have good aim so you're right behind him on "overwatch".
18:59:53 <Cane> You're doing awesome.
19:00:00 <Cane> You're watching the flank.
