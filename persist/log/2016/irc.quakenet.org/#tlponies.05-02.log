00:06:21 <DuB`> Ladymage is ready~
00:07:36 <DuB`> There is a dragon sitting on me in the Butt Zone.
00:07:46 <DuB`> Ruuuun.
00:09:21 <Phearlock> that's simply the dragon dungeon
00:12:02 <ZK> the lady wizard seems really young
00:12:18 <DoT`> she clearly hasnt spent 100 years in a forest
00:17:05 <DuB`> HUNDREDS OF YEARS FOREST.

00:25:07 <ZK> I just calculated our character's starting strength based on the point buy system, of which the standard is 27.
00:25:29 <ZK> My char is 30, so she's a bit better. Dub's first rool was at 17, so lol. He rerolled that and is at 37
00:25:32 <Camail> holy fucking shit hail
00:25:34 <Camail> omg so much hail
00:25:37 <Camail> am i dead
00:25:40 <Camail> fuuuuuuck afk
00:25:43 <Camail> gonna go down stairs
00:25:45 <ZK> hail in chicago? :o
00:25:52 <ZK> and phear is at 56
00:26:09 <DuB`> Phear pls.
00:26:10 <Phearlock> Yeah, I remember back in baldurs gate when you did roll for stats
00:26:18 <Phearlock> just reroll like 100 times until you got the good stuff
00:26:34 <ZK> lol really?
00:26:40 <ZK> then when not just do point buy? :P
00:26:54 <Phearlock> I don't know if point buy existed back then
00:26:58 <ZK> oh mKWA AWNAW
00:27:00 <DoT`> us first 4 seem to have got really screwed in stats
00:27:02 <Phearlock> based on second edition rules.
00:27:03 <DoT`> lol
00:27:04 <ZK> makes sense*
00:27:12 <ZK> well, mostly skram
00:27:18 <DoT`> mostly skram
00:27:30 <ZK> then cam told DuB` to reroll cause he got a bit better than what skram actually has :P
00:27:38 <DuB`> Bahahah.
00:27:42 <DuB`> skrma Kappa
00:27:52 <ZK> poor Butt
00:28:41 <DoT`> phear, you got those stats first roll right?
00:29:04 <ZK> yep
00:29:19 <DoT`> is there a reroll for making everyone else seem inadwquet?

00:29:56 <Camail> ok so a quarter inch of dime sized hail just fell everywhere in the span of 5 minutes
00:29:57 <ZK> how's hail?
00:29:59 <Camail> that was crazy
00:30:04 <DoT`> i plan to hide behind phear
00:30:06 <ZK> any windows break?
00:30:07 <Phearlock> that does sound crazy
00:30:16 <Camail> no the hail wasnt big enough
00:30:18 <Camail> just a ton of it
00:30:34 <DoT`> sounds painfull if outside
00:30:37 <Camail> it looks like the town is covered in fake snow
00:30:42 <DuB`> :O
00:30:43 <ZK> yay may
00:31:05 <Camail> also what about dm choice?
00:31:05 <DuB`> MEI YEI
00:31:12 <Camail> characters dont provide cover
00:31:21 <DuB`> DM choice whether or not to make Phear nerf himself Kappa
00:31:40 <DoT`> nerf dubs smuggness!
00:31:57 <Camail> having a beefy tank is good for everyone
00:32:12 <Camail> also everyone should have their lvl 3 planned out for tomorrow
00:32:20 <Camail> in case you level
00:32:42 <DuB`> Ack.
00:33:30 <Camail> yea you
00:33:38 <ZK> so many spell choices
00:34:08 <Camail> you and phear probably wont level in the middle of the session tho
00:34:13 <Camail> depends on my mood
00:35:49 <ZK> ooooh nice , all my spells are now 2nd level!
00:39:39 <Phearlock> I was honestly just rolling stats for fun. Hoping I'd get one 16 so I could slap it into STR and be confirmed useful.
00:39:52 <Phearlock> Then I got 18 on the first roll for STR and figured I was set
00:44:21 <Camail> yea he followed the same roll rules
00:44:26 <Camail> only makes sense 1 out of 6 was great
00:45:00 <Camail> 2 half healers, zk has false life, its all good
00:45:06 <Camail> the composition is solid
00:46:36 <DoT`> yea
00:48:25 <ZK> well, anything 16+ is considered great, and he did get a 16 on top of the 18, and a 15 also. 56 points is insane from a point buy system. But yea, the party comp is decent, just poor skram
00:56:09 <Camail> i mercy buffed skram
00:56:28 <Camail> tho honestly i wanted to give him 14 str before racial bonus
00:56:45 <Camail> but its so many sessions in i dunno if we should change it
00:56:53 <Camail> would need an entire party consensus
00:57:25 <ZK> We can start next session with that? I doubt people will oppose
00:58:14 <DuB`> Mmm.
00:58:30 <DoT`> ill kick dub before he joins if he opposes
00:58:36 <DuB`> :D
00:58:45 <DuB`> So what exactly does levelling up involve?
00:59:47 <ZK> choose spells
00:59:50 <ZK> add hp
01:00:08 <Phearlock> yeah everything else is fairly automatic in the character sheet.
01:00:42 <Phearlock> Oh and check if your class gets anything at a certain level
01:01:06 <DoT`> we went through all that dub when you made your character
01:01:27 <DoT`> you picked more spells and your school of magic
01:01:35 <DuB`> Well.
01:01:47 <DuB`> I thought that we decided that additional spells would need to be found, no?
01:03:14 <DoT`> i tihnk your book says you learn 2 new speels every spell level? but its between you and cam
01:03:26 <DoT`> and i could easly be wrong, you picked the complex class
01:06:38 <Phearlock> I was a bit confused at the divine spellcasting thing as well as the whole prepared spells vs spell slots/level was new to me
01:06:49 <Phearlock> Not read up on how wizards do it

02:10:53 <Camail> DoT`  where does it say wizzards get more spells
02:11:05 <Camail> I'd prefer that was a way to also gain spells, honestly
02:11:18 <Camail> but i looked through the entire wizard section and didnt see it

02:41:25 <DuB`> In the BasicRules pdf.

02:42:22 <Camail> oh
02:42:25 <Camail> its also in the phb
02:42:36 <Camail> so yea pick 4 more spells
02:42:41 <Camail> well 2
02:42:48 <Camail> but then also 2 more for lvl 3 just in case
02:45:23 <DuB`> Gaaah.
02:51:27 <Camail> want help?
03:02:48 <Camail> DuB`  thunderwave could be useful since you have the anti friendly fire thing
03:02:55 <DuB`> Yeah.
03:03:14 <DuB`> Hm...
03:03:22 <Camail> disguise self is a very good utility spell
03:03:26 <DuB`> I need to have that spell slots table open all the time.
03:03:54 <Camail> in your spells tab you can keep track of max spell slots and available spell slots
03:04:30 <Camail> comprehend languages is also a good utility spell
03:06:02 <DuB`> I'll finish getting ready tomorrow morning.
03:27:50 <ZK> GoT was good

03:43:24 <skrma> did you do the rage thing
03:43:44 <Camail> i didnt know if you wanted me to
03:43:58 <skrma> i tried to figure it out
03:44:32 <Camail> do you want me to?
03:44:49 <Camail> its only a matter of adding a rage_bonus attribute, setting it to two
03:45:05 <Camail> then adding {@rage_bonus} into the damage part oft he weapon

15:55:32 <DuB`> Gotta pick 2 new spells right now!
15:55:33 <DuB`> Hmm!
15:56:33 <skrma> get charm person
15:56:40 <skrma> zeke is not very good at it
15:56:54 <ZK> hey i got him talking.
15:58:49 <DuB`> Dunno how useful misty step would be but teleporting is pretty cool? 
15:58:52 <DuB`> Um.
15:59:16 <ZK> yea, teleporting out of danger can be really useful
15:59:26 <ZK> even if you have more health than the barbarian
15:59:26 <DuB`> Also detect thoughts. :o
15:59:40 <ZK> detect magic is a must btw
15:59:49 <DuB`> Someone already has it?
15:59:51 <DuB`> I thought.
15:59:53 <ZK> nope
15:59:55 <ZK> no one has that
15:59:58 <DuB`> Oh.
16:00:03 <DuB`> It'd fit with Vanessa, too.
16:00:05 <DuB`> Sure.
16:00:54 <ZK> what are your cantrips anyhow? Do you have minor illusion :P
16:01:41 <DuB`> Nope.
16:02:04 <ZK> dont need it anyhow, bard has that. But you could outillusion each other
16:02:43 <ZK> magic missile is generally something a lot of wizards take, since its sure to hit
16:03:54 <ZK> mage armor is also fun to avoid damage
16:04:03 <DuB`> Got 'em.
16:04:05 <DoT`> ncie zk!
16:04:31 <DoT`> shield is a nice spell
16:04:32 <DuB`> Ooooooooooh, misty step can be for a bonus action.
16:04:40 <ZK> misty step is something i'll probly end up taking as well
16:04:44 <DuB`> So, in addition to normal movement?
16:04:45 <DuB`> Want.
16:07:04 <DoT`> misty step op
16:08:44 <DuB`> Oops, did it wrong.
16:08:49 <DuB`> I can get that NEXT level.
