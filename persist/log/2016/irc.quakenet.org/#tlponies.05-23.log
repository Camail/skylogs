03:37:44 <ZK> cause blizz games have sold while he was writing things?
03:38:17 <motbob> i'm sure metzen's writing was top tier in the industry when wc3

07:48:58 <Cane> <motbob> Why is Chris Metzen allowed to write things
07:49:01 <Cane> That is a good goddamned question.
07:50:16 <Cane> Back in the day, he was like an artist and idea man who made art for fantasy and science fiction works written by fantasy and science fiction writers, and somewhere along the line he became the lead designer and writer for most Blizzard IPs.
07:51:17 <Cane> I don't think I dislike a writer more than I do Metzen. He is just miserable at it.
07:57:02 <Runbunny> He just really really like Thrall.

12:34:09 <Lynda> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK5-5Fm-rm8&feature=youtu.be&a
12:34:19 <Rawr|Phone> Hi lynda
12:38:10 <Lynda> https://rateyourmusic.com/list/quadratganger/albums_with__various_amounts_of__replay_value/ I like how I pretty much listen to more game OSTs than "actual" albums these days (started this list just this month)
12:40:43 <Saurabhinator> hey
12:43:08 <skram> to be fair, the bastion soundtrack is pretty freakin great
12:43:58 <skram> Sigur ros too, for that matter :p
12:44:09 <Lynda> indeed :D
12:44:47 <skram> I think i've listened to their newest album more than any others though
12:44:51 <Lynda> also I will need to give new Radiohead many more listens - listened to it the first time yesterday night and already album of the year on 1st listen for me
12:45:02 <skram> Some of the songs on kveikur sounds pretty epic on a decent stereo
12:45:35 <Lynda> :3
12:46:44 <skram> Though I will admit that Ågætis Byrjun has only good songs
12:46:48 <skram> :D
12:47:04 <Lynda> :D
12:47:27 <Lynda> I could not choose between (), Ågætis and Takk...
12:47:39 <Lynda> all 3 are easily in my top 5 albums of all time
12:47:50 <Lynda> in top lists I just list all 3 tied on 2nd spot xD
12:48:35 <Lynda> time flies so fast, found out about Sigur Ros 10 years ago and they've remained solidly among my absolute favourite bands unlike other bands throughout the decade
12:49:03 <Lynda> they survived the test of time
12:49:09 <skram> I dont think I could choose 10 albums and put them on a top 10 list honestly
12:49:22 <Lynda> yeah, it is excruciatingly hard
12:50:47 <Lynda> speaking of Sigur Ros and other bands with build-ups frequently incorporated into their music
12:50:48 <Lynda> np: toby fox [UNDERTALE Soundtrack #71 2015] - Undertale [6:22] {?}
12:50:52 <Lynda> the buildup of this song is so gloriously done
12:52:51 <skram> I still havent played undertale :p
12:55:49 <Lynda> you should
12:56:53 <Lynda> I am looking forward to rateyourmusic releasing their gaming site, just so I can have rated as 5/5: To The Moon, Undertale, Amnesia: TDD, Pokemon GSC and SC BW
12:57:25 <skram> Ive been meaning to, I just got caught up in stuff I guess
12:59:45 <skram> Amnesia is kinda weird for me. I really like it but i am a complete wuss when it comes to horror (or any sort of vaguely scary games) so I probably have less than 10 minutes played in it
13:01:13 <skram> I had nightmares for years after Silent Hill 2.
13:01:24 <skram> (Which also has a brilliant soundtrack, by the way)
13:01:57 <Lynda> yeah I hate horror too, but it is objectively easily the best horror game I've ever found, and I am a sucker for gothic structural beauty and such haunting OSTs and such immersive atmospheres
13:02:03 <Lynda> Amnesia is perfect at what it is supposed to do
13:02:33 <Lynda> and I still remember all the time waking up early in the morning before botany labs just to watch with #tlp Day9 streaming Amnesia live
13:02:55 <Lynda> again, time flies so fast

18:01:46 <DoT`> camamail snela
18:01:50 <DuB`> I don't even know how.
18:02:13 <DuB`> I just got mad and tried to break all of my network settings even further and then reset them to default, and then it worked! :D
18:02:29 <DuB`> Basically.
18:02:36 <DoT`> yes, break things
18:07:33 <DuB`> DoT` did you see today's Marigold? :)
18:09:08 <DoT`> no, i was playing arma3 BR with halv
18:09:24 <DoT`> HAHAHa
18:09:34 <DoT`> this is a good unicorn comic
18:10:06 <DuB`> Yus. ^_^

18:13:54 <DoT`> look dub, halv and I won
18:14:15 <DuB`> HOORAY.
18:14:43 <Camail> is overwatch blizzards most successful game in awhile? it seems to be even more hyped than sc2
18:14:56 <Camail> most people kinda cared about sc2 but RTS is way more niche than fps
18:15:01 <DoT`> original sc2 or lotv?
18:15:16 <ZK> original sc2 was very hyped as i recall
18:15:28 <DuB`> D3 was enormous.
18:15:39 <ZK> eveyrone was playing, and then hype died down slowly
18:15:44 <ZK> D3 was also enormous
18:15:46 <DoT`> i would say overwatch > lotv 
18:16:02 <DoT`> D3 was bigger than overwatch i think
18:17:16 <DuB`> D3 had had 15m unique players by 2013 (1 year), it seems.
18:17:50 <DuB`> OW got 10m in a week BUT it was free for that week.
18:17:52 <DuB`> So... I dunno. :P
18:18:12 <reification> laters pons
