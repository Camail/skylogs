00:02:56 <skram> calm down
00:05:38 <Camail> no
00:05:40 <Camail> its dumb
00:05:49 <skram> well yeah
00:05:52 <skram> twitch sucks
00:06:11 <Camail> i wish there was a real alternative
00:07:24 <Camail> isnt it funny tho
00:07:31 <Camail> how there greatest achievement was an accident
00:07:34 <Camail> their*
00:07:43 <skram> whats their greatest achievement
00:07:50 <Camail> channel emotes were supposed to never be globally usable
00:08:00 <skram> i did not know that
00:08:09 <Camail> it was an accident that they worked everywhere
00:08:26 <Camail> and everyone loved it so they kept it in
00:08:48 <Camail> and now emotes are their #1 monetization asset
00:08:56 <Camail> that and streamers whoring themselves out for subs
00:09:40 <Camail> also they rely on 3rd party devs to make the tools people want
00:09:48 <Camail> like BTTV, FFZ, and oddshot
00:10:00 <Camail> oh and paypal donations
00:10:21 <Camail> twitch has basically just taken safe risks after the community built the tools they wanted
00:10:42 <skram> well they dont have any competition
00:10:43 <Camail> great for them, but its annoying
00:10:43 <skram> at all
00:11:05 <Camail> there have been a handful of attempts
00:11:18 <Camail> but twitch has the userbase and the system in place to make streaming a viable living
00:11:30 <Camail> which is the only thing they've done wellt hat wasn't someone elses idea
00:11:38 <Camail> which is actualy the biggest thing
00:11:40 <skram> fair enough
00:12:13 <Camail> they changed their encoding and added 20 more seconds to delay to allow for 20k+ viewers at all times
00:14:20 <Camail> and in the end i actually dont mind all the stuff they've done, but for the love of fuck don't start fucking with emotes
00:14:25 <Camail> also bits are shit
00:14:42 <Camail> bits are borderline unethical
00:14:47 <Camail> because they encourage whales
00:15:54 <skram> wat
00:16:23 <Camail> whales are gonna donate large sums anyway, so they cant prevent streamers from subsisting on whale income
00:16:25 <Camail> but
00:16:41 <skram> i dont know what you are talking about
00:16:43 <skram> bits? whales?
00:16:45 <Camail> bits give chat badges for large sums of money, up to 1k USD
00:16:49 <Camail> bits, twitch bits
00:16:51 <Camail> the donating system
00:16:56 <Camail> whales = donators who give a lot of money
00:17:03 <Camail> its a term most heavily used in the mobile gaming industry
00:17:13 <skram> i am learning so much
00:17:15 <Camail> they account for most of the money made from mobile games
00:17:18 <Camail> and its the same in twitch
00:17:22 <Camail> catties was a whale
00:17:44 <skram> catties had too much money and a drinking problem
00:17:51 <Camail> its unstable, unsatisfied, or insecure people with HIGH disposable income that give a lot of money to a game or a person
00:18:00 <Camail> or normal people with gamlbing problems
00:19:01 <Camail> bits are designed to reward big donations with badges that the entire world can see
00:19:05 <Camail> and twitch takes a HUGE cut
00:19:41 <Camail> 29% at the highest, and somehwere between 10-20 at the lowest (looking exact number up now)
00:20:00 <Camail> so twitch is siphoning off money from the whales and encouraging their spending habits to pad their profits
00:20:09 <Camail> which is actually not good?
00:20:14 <Camail> I dont think its good
00:20:46 <skram> well ethical quandries aside its a good way for twitch to make money
00:21:00 <skram> which is their highest priority
00:21:28 <Camail> yea and thats the same goal for the bitch who upped the epipen price
00:21:35 <Camail> yet here we are roasting her on a pike
00:21:56 <Camail> 13.6% is the lowest fee for bits
00:22:05 <Camail> paypal takes what, 2%? 3?
00:22:41 <skram> weeell i think jacking the price up by like 200% or whatever the fuck on lifesaving medicine is a teensy bit more importanter than twitch bits
00:22:42 <skram> no idea
00:23:02 <Camail> of course its more important
00:23:08 <Camail> but ethics is important in business
00:23:48 <Camail> and we should hold companies accountable
00:24:44 <Camail> enabling people to spend money irresponsibly is serious, it might not be life threatening but it is on the list of serious things that usually make people go to jail if you do it too much
00:25:07 <Camail> they aren't being unlawful, but they are being unethical

04:40:37 <Camail> so capcom sucks and is dumb
04:40:38 <Bio> listening
04:40:56 <Camail> They updated sf5 with a security patch to stop some hacks/abuse
04:41:03 <Camail> their method was installing an unsigned driver
04:41:21 <Camail> it disabled the windows security system, rane all its code, then renabled
04:41:40 <Camail> with no checks to see if the code was tampered
04:42:08 <Camail> basically making thousands of people's computers REALLY vulnerable to attacks for a day
04:42:17 <Camail> they took out the driver earlier today
04:42:39 <Camail> they have NO idea how to code for PCs
04:42:48 <Camail> japan is so shit at developing for computers
04:42:50 <Camail> its amazing
04:43:45 <Camail> thats just...the fucking put A DRIVE IN SYSTEM32

20:18:19 <skram> yessssssss
20:18:19 <Bio> dab pls
20:19:46 <skram> Oh I dont know if you like dark and moody acoustic music DuB`, but I found a thing thats been stuck on me for a while now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3DAfTdGYJ4
20:20:57 <skram> Do you know what genre this is, DuB`? Is this like electro punk or something
20:21:04 <skram> pretty similar to The Sounds
20:21:06 <DuB`> No idea!
20:21:43 <DuB`> Wikipedia: synthpop, art pop, dream pop, experimental pop, electronica. :P
20:22:16 <skram> art pop seems pretty apropos
20:22:18 <DuB`> PRETTY sure "electronica" doesn't actually mean anything.
20:22:31 <skram> mostly because of the weird outfits
20:22:43 <DuB`> Heheheh
20:22:56 <skram> i guess its like a catch-all term for "music with electronic sounds" or whatever
20:23:06 <DuB`> I don't listen to much acoustic but this is nice. :O
20:23:07 <skram> kinda like everything is indie
20:23:09 <skram> even if it isnt
20:23:13 <DuB`> Yeah. 
20:23:52 <skram> I really like her voice. Its kinda husky
20:24:07 <skram> She has a great cover of Glory Box, which is the sexiest song ever.

20:27:37 <DuB`> Grimes does her own production and even album art, by the way. 
20:27:41 <DuB`> Pretty cool. 
20:32:48 <skram> Which one is grimes
20:32:49 <skram> :P
20:33:57 <skram> is it curly haired leotard person, or facepaint hanzo cosplayer person
20:36:11 <DuB`> Fishnet hanzo is pretty great.
20:36:16 <DuB`> But I think she's curlyhair. ;D
20:36:46 <skram> thats a weird way to dye your hair
20:37:24 <DuB`> I like the strips-of-plastic overcoat/poncho.
