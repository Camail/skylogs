17:33:32 <Runbunny> oh right
17:33:47 <Runbunny> watch both Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann movies.
17:33:59 <Micen> Fine if you wont watch anime just re-watch OPM over and over and say you are watching "Anime"
17:34:03 <Yolteotl> Ghibli, Satoshi Kon, Mamoru Hosoda
17:34:16 <DoT`> lol

17:34:55 <Phearlock> anime things I have watched: howls moving castle, redline
17:35:05 <Yolteotl> Rocket league first game cross platform Ps4-Xbox one-PC
17:35:07 <Phearlock> first was ok, second was very western lol
17:35:18 <Rawr|Fone> Please don't do anime
17:35:20 <Phearlock> And err, I'm pretty sure thats the entire list
17:35:24 <Rawr|Fone> Stay away from drugs kids

17:36:35 <Phearlock> triple pony
17:36:36 <Micen> I did an anime once. 
17:36:50 <Micen> Now I am a fat lazy american weeaboo, desu.
17:36:53 <Runbunny> The true drug is the monogatari series though
17:36:59 <Runbunny> or mayhaps Illya.
17:37:02 <Runbunny> anyhoo.
17:37:14 <Runbunny> You didn't watch the one about the wolf children Phearlock?
17:37:30 <Phearlock> I... don't think so?
17:37:39 <Phearlock> If I did I don't rememeber
17:38:08 <DoT`> oh found it, it was k-on i still need to finish
17:41:34 <Runbunny> oh.
17:41:36 <Runbunny> well
17:41:57 <Runbunny> I always knew that you were a little moeblob Dot.
17:42:02 <motbob> people will crucify me for this but you should just watch everything on this page not named Gintama, in order http://myanimelist.net/topanime.php
17:42:25 <DoT`> i watched FMA and was only told about brotherhood after
17:42:52 <Phearlock> I don't think we're the anime ISIS motbob. You (probably) won't be crucified/beheaded.
17:43:15 <BioPhone> *aggressive neighing*
17:44:39 <Runbunny> O:
17:45:04 <Runbunny> it's the mere mention of anime which will set peoples dicks on fire.
17:45:19 <Runbunny> Just look at bio.
17:47:08 <Micen> Mot, you also forgot to exclude Clannad: After Story/add Clannad on there as well
17:47:18 <motbob> Boku dake ga Inai Machi, this season, is quite good, and it's even better if you start watching without knowing anything about it
17:47:42 <motbob> literally read nothing about it, and you'll have a fun ride
17:49:03 <Micen> I may do that.

19:36:10 <motbob> can you describe penny's personality
19:36:53 <motbob> actually the personalities of everyone in this game kind of suck. they're all defined by what they do rather than who they are
19:37:04 <BioPhone> Kinda
19:37:07 <BioPhone> Yeah
19:37:35 <BioPhone> The dev has said that he didnt like the state of marriages in this game
19:37:42 <motbob> the love interests anyway
19:38:07 <Phearlock> So, time to hire some shipping writers?
19:38:11 <motbob> george and shane and pam are all kind of interesting
19:38:24 <DoT`> poor goerge
19:38:25 <motbob> absolutely. let's make a "good writing" mod
19:38:49 <Phearlock> Not a bad idea really, lots of games could use that.
19:39:44 <BioPhone> Hes a solo dev right? Hard to be great at everything, and the gameplay is really nice.
19:39:45 <Crisium> how often are elevator floors
19:39:55 <Crisium> i swear i went down 5 from 5, but no elevator
19:39:59 <Crisium> runnout of of enermy
19:40:02 <Crisium> energy*
19:40:35 <motbob> every 5
19:40:50 <Crisium> and i just found it, whew
19:40:51 <motbob> the floor number is in the top left
19:40:52 <DoT`> the level you are on is in the top left corner
19:40:57 <Crisium> oh you're right
19:40:59 <Crisium> silly me
19:41:24 <DoT`> early on use snack bar tihngs
19:41:34 <DoT`> you can spare the seeds
19:42:01 <Crisium> lol ya, i have 2 stars with just Abigail and Linus
19:42:04 <Crisium> my favs
19:42:25 <motbob> a lot of things in stardew valley are pretty good, until you consider that they were all made by one guy, and then they become amazing
19:42:30 <DoT`> 2 stars?
19:42:38 <Crisium> hearts*
19:42:41 <DoT`> ah
19:42:55 <motbob> the music's pretty good,... except this guy doesn't make music for a living, so it becomes amazing
19:43:03 <DoT`> you can give 2 gifts a week to each person crisium, you need to git more
19:43:07 <motbob> the graphics are pretty good, except... etc
19:43:21 <motbob> you know what makes a good gift? parsnips
19:43:26 <Crisium> if i spend all day running around finding NPCs how can i get money
19:43:27 <Crisium> lol
19:43:33 <DoT`> Its very immpressive
19:43:34 <motbob> by growing potators
19:43:56 <Crisium> y potato
19:44:03 <DoT`> many potato
19:44:10 <motbob> i have the 20-people-with-5-hearts achivement and i'm also rich. it's possible.
19:44:17 <motbob> potatoes are just good return-wise
19:44:28 <motbob> they give you a good % on investment per day
19:44:31 <Crisium> how long did that take, to get all those 5 hearts
19:44:40 <motbob> mmmm a couple seasons
19:44:49 <DoT`> Make sure to give birthday gifts
19:44:59 <motbob> and, careful study of the wiki
19:45:08 <Crisium> is talking alone enough to boost hearts
19:45:14 <Crisium> or gifts needed
19:45:24 <motbob> slowly, but yes
19:45:41 <DoT`> i use the wiki now to find ppl on birthdays, i thought i had a good idea of where they all went, but it changes with season
19:45:53 <DoT`> otherwise i normaly check thier spots
19:46:14 <motbob> i think talking is +20 and gifts are +45
19:46:23 <Crisium> i guess i should check out the bar each night, usually a few ppl there
19:46:26 <motbob> if you don't talk to them, you get -2
19:47:01 <DoT`> tuesday at the shop women gather 
19:47:16 <Crisium> gave shane my first gift, hes lucky he likes salmonberry's or i woulda slew him where he stands
19:47:26 <DoT`> HAHA really?
19:47:35 <DoT`> i found no one that liked them except science guy
19:47:41 <DoT`> who seems happy to science anything
19:47:43 <Crisium> ya a lot of ppl hate them
19:47:58 <DoT`> and linus
19:48:06 <DoT`> linus is so gratefull
19:48:16 <DoT`> haley takes a gift then insults your shoes
19:49:24 <motbob> linus and leah like all forage because they're hard up for food
19:49:34 <motbob> so they take anything you can digest
19:49:48 <Crisium> gave everyone at the bar salmonberrys
19:49:53 <DoT`> LOL
19:49:54 <Crisium> 2 liked lol
19:49:57 <Crisium> shane and pam

20:40:07 <carcinisation> this poker tournament appears to be stuck somehow. i haven't played a hand in almost 10 mins o.O
20:43:47 <carcinisation> oh it's a heads up shootout. now it all makes sense :D
20:46:29 <carcinisation> and other ppl didn't realise went afk so now we're stuck waiting for matches between ppl who aren't there to finish before we can move on to the next round
20:49:51 <DoT`> Runbunny, should i be tryning to get through the ghosts in the ruins before the dukes archive?
20:53:16 <Runbunny> order doesn't matter at this point.
20:53:33 <DoT`> ok, because i suck at bot
20:53:34 <DoT`> h
20:53:40 <Runbunny> you need the great lord souls. what order you get them in doesn't matter.
20:54:08 <Runbunny> But probably the boss beyond the ghost is kinda tough.
20:54:42 <DoT`> the archive i died a few times stupidly so i went elsewhere
20:55:02 <DoT`> that magic guy takes off over half my life with 1 shot
20:55:31 <DoT`> so i decided to get hit by him a few times
20:55:44 <DoT`> maybe build up a resistance

23:10:53 <DuB`> Dot~!
23:10:55 <DuB`> You need me?
23:10:59 <DuB`> ... a long time ago?
23:11:37 <DoT|Phone> duuuub
23:11:48 <DoT|Phone> I always need you
23:12:38 <DuB`> :O
23:12:58 <DuB`> I was going to go shopping today buy my brother will have the car until after I've gone to sleep.
23:13:02 * DuB` starves to death.
23:13:09 <DuB`> but my*
23:16:54 <DoT`> <3
23:17:05 <DoT`> i couldnt recall the name K-on and knew you would
23:18:05 <DuB`> Ah.
23:19:47 <Camail> DoT`  I'm at the art show
23:20:01 <DoT`> i havnt got there before!
23:21:05 <Camail> its like...
23:21:11 <Camail> all the things i hate about artists
23:21:16 <Camail> they might have ruined leah for me
23:21:42 <Camail> I really really hate high concept art =/
23:22:17 <Camail> "Post-dimensional Nullspace"
23:22:21 <Camail> That's one of her pieces
23:22:22 <Camail> ffs
23:22:32 <Camail> kill me just murder my dick please
23:22:41 <DuB`> Heheheheh.
23:22:46 <DoT`> oh dear
23:23:06 <DoT`> but leah was nice D: why they do this
23:23:18 <motbob> some games make it tricky to choose a love interest because they're all so unrealistically interesting or otherwise attractive
23:23:21 <DoT`> thoughts on Maruuu cam?
23:23:26 <motbob> Stardew Valley is not that kind of game
23:24:21 <Camail> maru is uninteresting
23:24:25 <Camail> also her father threatened me
23:24:26 <Camail> fuck that shit
23:24:37 <Camail> demetrius is a cockbag
23:24:40 <DoT`> ya, haha, that father
23:24:42 <DoT`> lol
23:25:09 <DoT`> abigail still seems to have the best scenes to me
23:26:15 <Camail> yea
23:26:16 <Camail> but
23:26:16 <Camail> 12
23:26:29 <Camail> she is actually a baby
23:26:48 <Camail> I might go with her anyway...penny is such a fuck up
23:26:56 <Camail> haley has no personality
23:27:00 <DuB`> How many girls are there?
23:27:19 <motbob> my perception of abagail is pretty different from yours
23:27:28 <Camail> maru is just...there. leah is apparently a post-modernist hippy...
23:27:30 <Camail> 5
23:27:32 <motbob> i don't see her as immature, just emotional
23:27:46 <carcinisation> i think i'm going to get this game just so i can understand chat
23:27:47 <Camail> mot I'm just going by the context clues
23:27:59 <Camail> her parents own a book about how to raise a teenager
23:28:27 <Crisium_> I prefer raw unadulterated wood
23:28:56 <Camail> but like, she does so many teen things
23:29:11 <motbob> mmm
23:29:18 <Camail> she dreams of adventure, she confesses through a game, she...well i dont want to spoil every scene
23:29:58 <Camail> obsessed with her pale complexion as much as haley is obsessed with getting a tan
23:30:07 <motbob> this is a world where you can walk to the cave and kill slimes
23:30:25 <motbob> and grow giant vegetables
23:30:34 <Camail> she's not awful, she's been in my top 2 choices since the beginning, but its still so bleh
23:30:38 <Twi> slime rancher?
23:31:49 <Camail> why does the fantasy aspect count against my concerns?
23:32:41 <Camail> she's a gothy teen who does gothy teen things, and i feel like she hasn't put her shit in order
23:33:00 <Camail> which is super normal
23:33:35 <Camail> i just dont know if i want to play a main character that is interested in that
23:34:16 <DoT`> https://www.twitch.tv/gauntletsc2
23:34:30 <Camail> tbh I'm still in an emotional fallout after my #1 pick turned into someone i cant stand
23:34:42 <Camail> the pain, the betrayal
23:34:50 <Camail> its too much for my soul to bear
23:34:53 <Camail> roar
23:34:53 <DoT`> should have picked internet shop :P
23:35:30 <Camail> I'm glad i didn't
23:35:42 <Camail> ignorance isn't bliss, it would have come out eventually
23:35:45 <Camail> then I'd have to kill her
23:35:50 <Camail> we dont want murder in stardew
23:35:59 <Camail> i have two rings of yoba on
23:36:03 <Camail> they couldnt fucking handle me
23:36:14 <Camail> bullets bouncing off my chest while i stab them is an obsidian sword
23:37:00 <DoT`> camail, dub finaly watched opm!
23:37:42 <Camail> good
23:37:48 <Camail> well tbf he read it before

23:38:15 <DoT`> he was lazy
23:38:21 <Camail> he asked for the RAWs ages ago
23:38:31 <DoT`> then never read them

23:48:44 <Camail> DoT`  oh lol i didnt put 2 and 2 together that she probably hates it because drunk parent
23:49:32 <Camail> for being the classic 'simple' option she seems to be the most sympathetic
23:49:42 <Camail> all she wants is a not-shit life
