01:09:10 <DoT`> tomorow i should be able to get halv and other friend to play
01:09:14 <DoT`> and try get ranks
01:09:25 <DoT`> halv is now lvl 3
01:11:16 <Camail> DoT`  be prapred to be around silver 4
01:11:25 <DoT`> yip :(
01:11:33 <Camail> you ahvent play in awhile and rank change has really really hurt mid levle players
01:11:44 <Camail> bio got straight fucked
01:11:57 <Camail> some gn1 players are silver 2
01:12:09 <Camail> so you might even be silver 2 or 3
01:12:11 <Camail> so dont feel bad
01:12:55 <DoT`> im ready for sadness!
01:13:52 <Camail> no! dont be!
01:13:54 <Camail> just dont be sad
01:14:54 <DoT`> well cam, i dont see how that works
01:16:36 <Camail> well see, you asses the reasons to be sad
01:18:12 <Camail> and thne you realize those reasons aren't worthy
01:18:38 <Camail> then you just play the game because its fun, or you stop because its not fun
01:18:57 <DoT`> haha, I dont recall when i actually last got sad/angry at a game, with myself though that happens a lot
01:19:16 <DoT`> meh, its only really my incosistency that annoys me, i work on it
01:19:42 <Camail> well thats what i mean, being sad or angry at yourself is what I'm talking about
01:20:05 <Camail> you're inconsistent for very obvious and treatable reasons
01:20:18 <Camail> and until those are solved you're jsut gonna BE inconsistent
01:20:33 <Camail> nothing to be annoyed about, its how the world works
01:20:51 <Camail> and people are gonna get butthurt
01:21:03 <Camail> the other team will think your hacking if you do well, teammates will ahte you if you do poorly
01:21:11 <Camail> they're all 16 year odl fuck boys
01:21:19 <Camail> and none of them matter
01:21:32 <Camail> and if you play with friends who do matter to you, they shouldn't get mad 
01:22:45 <Camail> I've never meant anything like I do this statement: fuck those guys, fuck all of them.

01:25:36 <DoT`> haha yea, people are idiots
01:26:05 <DoT`> I just expect better sometimes of myself, I had the same in BF4 even after years of play I would mess up inn supid ways
01:26:09 <DoT`> stupid*
01:26:11 <DoT`> it happens
01:27:44 <Camail> yea but at this early stage in csgo your mental health will suffer much more because you make more mistakes
01:27:56 <Camail> so you can transfer the mentality from a game you know better
01:29:30 <Camail> cant*
01:29:32 <Camail> bad typo
01:31:57 <motbob> cane, do you have any insight on how you would, if given a video file link, start downloading from a certain part of that video file?
01:32:22 <motbob> actully never mind
01:32:29 <skrma> cam did you play the last DAI dlc
01:32:38 <BioSC> pone
01:32:44 <Cane> Glad I could help.
01:32:58 <Camail> no skram not yet
01:33:00 <Camail> I am goign to soon
01:33:15 <Camail> my credit card is frozen atm so i cant get it
01:33:31 <Camail> but I'm at the end og the game on my second playthrough so I'm ready
01:33:37 <skrma> D:
01:33:53 <skrma> Imma pick it up when I get paid
01:34:01 <BioSC> I got over my rank sadness
01:34:03 <BioSC> =)
01:34:24 <BioSC> though x2 is takign most of my game time atm
01:35:02 <skrma> did you play any of the other DLCs?
01:37:33 <motbob> actually cane if you could find a /c/ VOD with short duration (<20 minutes) I can probably fix the downloader entirely
01:38:04 <motbob> never ind i found on
01:38:09 <Cane> Glad I could help.
01:38:16 <DuB`> Cane you are so good at this.
01:38:16 <DoT`> your amazing cane
01:38:18 <BioSC> what a hero cane
01:38:23 <DuB`> Waow.
01:38:32 <BioSC> saving lives in game and out
01:40:06 <motbob> unfortunately, it seems like I won't be able to... actally never mind, I can.
01:40:28 <motbob> let's fucking do it BOYS
01:40:59 <DuB`> YEAHHH.
01:41:01 <DuB`> (??? D:)
01:41:04 <BioSC> LETS GO BOYS
01:41:54 <Camail> skrma no i don think theya re worth it for me
01:42:30 <Camail> DAI gameplay on pc is unweildy
01:42:44 <Camail> the actual balance is good, but the way they handled the mouse is shit
01:43:00 <Camail> after playing witcher 3 i cant play that much of daI without quitting
01:43:07 <Camail> too much of a pain to move around
01:43:35 <Camail> https://vimeo.com/116227240
01:43:48 <Camail> awww, why does she ahve a vimeo plugin
01:44:01 <Camail> ruins everything
01:44:01 <skrma> thats true
01:44:52 <skrma> You know how after you finish the game and save all of the things your companions and stuff wont talk to you anymore? If you play the DLCs after finishing it wont trigger any sort of banter.
01:45:26 <Camail> that sucks
01:45:58 <skrma> And afaik the new DLC is kinda of a post-game ending thing which can only be played after you finish
01:46:09 <Camail> yea it is
01:46:13 <DoT`> .tell runbunny http://imgur.com/gallery/GOuntRo
01:46:20 <Camail> which is why i did my second palythrough
01:46:40 <Camail> i didnt hook up DAO or DA2 to my first DAI playthrough
01:47:55 <skrma> Its not super critical but it adds a bit of neat backstory and cameos and whatnot
01:48:38 <Camail> to me I would like it because DAO is my foavourite of all the games and it didnt pick my choices
01:48:47 <Camail> but i swear that i picked the baby in my dao playthrough
01:48:55 <Camail> but it said i died in the boss fight
01:50:02 <Camail> my one regret in dao
01:50:10 <Camail> is that i never did the foursome
01:50:18 <skrma> haha
01:50:29 <skrma> its less exciting than it sounds cam
01:50:30 <Camail> i know exactly how, i just never did it
01:50:37 <Camail> ITS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE MATTER SKRAM
01:50:43 <skrma> ok sorry geez
01:50:59 <Camail> hardening leliana was more difficult in dao than it is in dai
01:54:27 <skrma> dao had a lot more different choices than dai did
01:55:14 <Camail> yea dai was like mass effect, you do the main missions, you get character side quests, you make them more loyal by completeing them
01:55:17 <Camail> then you win
01:55:24 <Camail> (I hate mass effect so much it hurts)
01:55:31 <skrma> :(
01:56:04 <Camail> 90% of my hate comes from how it was resposible for everything bad in da2 and dai
01:56:21 <Camail> other than the asset reuse in da2
01:56:35 <Camail> tho who knows, maybe ME3 took away resources
01:56:48 <Camail> I choose to believe that so that my rage is even more justified
01:57:53 * BioSC prods Camail
01:58:08 <Camail> hmmm
01:58:23 <Camail> 20 minutes?
01:58:54 <BioSC> k
01:59:15 <Camail> my internet is megashit right now so this'll be fun

03:00:14 -!- mode/#tlponies [+v ZK] by Q
03:00:21 <motbob> that is, i can start the download right before the start time, but I can't end it right after the end time
03:00:30 <ZK> huh, DoT` is sleeping :o
03:00:55 <ZK> ?dash
03:03:50 <Cane> motbob, I don't know enough about it but I would assume that's because the end of the file has all of the codec and container information.
03:04:09 <Cane> But then I am stupid, and don't know for sure.
03:04:56 <Cane> For instance, I just had to troubleshoot a script because it said @northWastCheck instead of West.
03:05:07 <Cane> Things were so much easier when we had longboats and axes.
03:06:16 <motbob> hmmmm
03:07:14 <ZK> wast?
03:18:10 <motbob> cane, i give up actually
03:18:20 <motbob> i can't even get the start thing to work
03:18:38 <motbob> I am sorry, but you will have to spend 400MB for your 40 second clip
03:19:05 <Cane> I don't really blame you, video files are finicky bastards.
03:19:17 <Cane> Your solution (download appropriate files and then crop) is what I would have done in your place.
03:19:52 <Cane> Because the elegant solution is out of my reach (and a pain in the ass).
03:20:31 <Cane> You would probably need to rebuild the container after downloading and insert a whole bunch of new values.
03:20:34 <Cane> So, yeah.
03:20:43 <Cane> That's a thing.
03:23:22 <motbob> SeemsGood
03:46:50 <motbob> cane, what did you mean by command line support?
03:46:58 <motbob> in the blog reply
03:48:29 <Cane> On a basic level, having it so that when you run the .bat file you get prompted for the VOD link and time codes by the script so that you don't have to edit the .bat file before you run it.
03:49:22 <motbob> ehhhh so you have to enter it in every time?
03:49:54 <Cane> So when you run it, the file goes, "and what are we downloading today, young sir? and please tell me your time codes sir, thank you"
03:50:29 <Cane> Because right now you have to edit the .bat file to set the time codes and all that.
03:51:09 <Cane> Not a priority, just something that might be fun to mess with.

22:08:02 <DoT`> camail, you see we are back to salt!
22:08:07 <DoT`> with onlywatch
22:08:27 <Camail> good
22:08:51 <Camail> I like what you got, good job.
22:09:39 <DoT`> parts of that ep where great, but overall i think it was the weakest
22:09:56 <Camail> i think almsot th eopposite
22:10:20 <Camail> most of season 2 was like 7/10, this was a solid 9 to me
22:10:50 <Camail> i really dont care about the beth and jerry sideplots tho
22:10:51 <DoT`> i havnt rewatched s2 yet
22:12:01 <Camail> this one, the purge, the fart, and the finale were the most memorable to me
22:12:44 <Camail> The purge is the besssssst
22:12:46 <DoT`> purge was fun
22:13:09 <Camail> the purge was the closest to season 1 humor of any s2 episode
22:15:10 <DoT`> im thinking over s2 and there was a lot of beth/jerry wasnt there :/
22:15:51 <DoT`> need to rewatch it
22:16:26 <Camail> the only beth and jerry episode i liked was the marriage counsel one
22:17:16 <Camail> like, i get it, marriages arent fixed in a single episode and it does make sense that the pacing of repairing it was/has been happening the entire series, but that's fucking boring
22:17:29 <Camail> thats not why I want to watch rick and morty
22:18:10 <Camail> like wtf happened with eye patch morty
22:18:20 <Camail> and all the other weird little things they never did anything with
22:18:35 <DoT`> hopefully s3
22:18:54 <Camail> spending half of every episode on characters that are so unfunny...it just made me aggravated while watching
22:18:55 <DoT`> wall of mortys was pretty messed up
22:19:00 <Camail> which is salt in the wound
22:19:27 <Camail> oh, th eminiverse episode was good as well
22:19:35 <Camail> conveniently didnt ahve beth and jerry
22:19:57 <Camail> the characters in the show are bored with their shit WHY would the audience still care...
22:24:41 <Camail> wow going back to it, i liked every single episode that didnt have them in it
22:24:49 <DoT`> haha
22:25:14 <DoT`> which epsidoes did you outright not like?
22:25:16 <Camail> i didnt realize how much they retarded the story
22:25:20 <Camail> hmmm

22:25:53 <Camail> i cant remember
22:26:12 <Camail> its hard to tell because the marriage episodes were all sub plots
22:26:25 <Camail> and the ricky and morty main plots always outshine them so much i forget which was which
22:26:41 <Camail> interdimensional cable 2 was bad
22:27:07 <Camail> not only because it had beth and jerry, but because it wasnt as good as the first interdimensional cable
22:27:14 <Camail> which was like top 3 episodes of s1
22:27:25 <Camail> and there's nothing worse than a mediocre sequal
22:29:19 <Camail> oh wow yea, turns out i enjoyed all the s2 main plots
22:29:26 <Camail> and jsut hated all the side plots
22:29:32 <Camail> thats valuable information to know
22:29:50 <DoT`> time to go through and cut out those parts of the episodes
22:30:02 <Camail> i figured out why i liked s1 more than s2, which was bugging me
22:30:52 <DoT`> rick cares more?
22:31:01 <Camail> no its the weak sub plots
22:31:57 <Camail> which is due to beth and jerry being uninteresting characters
22:31:59 -!- BioPhone [~Bioandroi@166.175.186.85] has joined #tlponies
22:32:05 <Camail> they have not developed any interesting traits
22:32:36 <Camail> Summer has changed and developed and continues to be interesting, but the parents are the exact fucking same
22:32:41 <DoT`> the car devloped more than them
22:32:59 <Camail> what makes it worse is that they already HAD the same cathartic moment in season 1 with rick potion 9
22:33:17 <Camail> but that was from the first universe
22:33:36 <Camail> and they spent significant time redoing it all in season 2 so like wtf
22:34:17 <Camail> and like, where can they even go?
22:34:26 <Camail> they are defined as dysfunctional shit parents
22:34:39 <Camail> thats how they were introduced, they are defined by their insecurities
22:35:03 <Camail> so there's nothing to build on, and accomplishments they have are reduced to 'we are no longer as shitty as we were last episode'
22:35:26 <Camail> both they are so shitty, its like the creators are projecting their own insecurities into them
22:35:40 <Camail> and they're shitty int he boring normal human way, not like rick
22:36:00 <Camail> rick is fun shitty
22:37:05 <DoT`> Isnt pretty much summer the only non-dysfunctional one
22:39:02 <DoT`> and Birdperson

22:47:50 <Camail> DoT`  summer is a teenage girl
22:48:21 <Camail> also birdperson is a terrorist
22:49:50 <Camail> but summer is a very good character
22:50:00 <Camail> she's pretty fucked up, not quite as much as morty
22:51:08 <DoT`> and they are the least dysfunctoinal ppl in the show
22:51:49 <Camail> well, morty has murder issues
22:51:55 <Camail> its just that they are interesting
22:52:01 <Camail> beth and jerry have boring issues
22:52:20 <Camail> beth is insecure about the importance of her work and how that reflecs her value as a person
22:52:38 <Camail> jerry feels like he's useless being unemployed and gets jelous easily
22:52:42 <Camail> these are normal human problem
22:52:54 <Camail> boring problems when it comes to this show
22:53:17 <Camail> rick is a drunk intergalactic terrorist dead-beat
22:53:26 <Camail> those are worse problems, but they are fun problems
22:53:35 <Camail> also he's suicidal
22:54:06 <Camail> morty is a sexually repressed existentially vacant 13 year old boy who watched himself die
22:54:11 <Camail> and he's homicidal
