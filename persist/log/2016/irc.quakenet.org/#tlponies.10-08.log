00:44:31 <DuB`> T_T
00:44:33 <skram> it just doesnt make sense
00:44:34 <DuB`> Busy busy.
00:45:03 <DuB`> skram: Half of C9 left to continue their normal jobs/etc. :(
00:45:08 <DuB`> But they picked up MENDO.
00:45:16 <DuB`> (In trials now)
00:45:17 <DuB`> https://www.twitch.tv/gosutv_ow
00:45:19 <skram> Well they were no good anyways
00:45:26 <DuB`> They were always good!
00:45:32 <Rawr|Phone> Pls
00:45:33 <DuB`> MENDO + SUREFOUR COMBO
00:45:36 <Rawr|Phone> Plsssssssss
00:45:37 <DuB`> WE HAVE ARRIVED.
00:45:42 <skram> not as good as nvy
00:45:44 <Rawr|Phone> Dub calm down pls
00:46:30 <CockRoach|42> rawr pls be drunk
00:46:40 <Rawr|Phone> Maybe
00:46:44 <CockRoach|42> <3
00:46:58 <skram> rawr has a drinking problem
00:47:24 <skram> i dont know who mendo is, DuB`
00:47:25 <Rawr|Phone> Maybe I do, maybe I don't
00:47:27 <skram> tell me a boat him
00:47:31 <skram> or her
00:47:37 <skram> or xe
00:48:03 <DuB`> Mendo+tviq was the combo on OLD pre-sponsorship envyus that took the "unbeatable kings" from C9.
00:48:08 <DuB`> Way back when.
00:48:21 <DuB`> Took the title*
00:49:46 <skram> he is slightly better at hanzo than me
00:50:04 <DuB`> :D
00:50:06 <DuB`> I'm pretty hype.
00:50:10 <DuB`> Gonna miss grego though. :(
00:50:21 <DuB`> Hard to replace a support like him.
00:50:22 <skram> moral of the story
00:50:31 <skram> quit school and go pro in ow with me
00:50:42 <DuB`> UM.
00:50:44 <DuB`> 'Kay.
00:52:47 <skram> i feel bad for c9 on this point
00:53:38 <DuB`> WOO
00:53:40 <DuB`> REVENGE.
00:53:56 <DuB`> Liquid beat newC9 in their first game as a team yesterday.
00:53:59 <DuB`> Only loss so far~
00:54:11 <skram> :3
00:54:17 <skram> i really thought liquid was gonna hold it
00:54:21 <DuB`> Wolf ana has been meh.
00:54:32 <DuB`> Two or three nanoboosts on lucio yesterday. >_>
00:54:48 <DuB`> Ryb is solid and mendo is mendo.
00:55:10 <skram> lucio nanoboost secret tactic
00:55:26 <skram> i do it all the time
00:56:48 <DuB`> ;D
00:56:54 <DuB`> Oh yeah, hanzo is meta now.
00:57:06 <CockRoach|42> .roll d20 to pon
00:57:11 <skram> i have not watched any streams since the patch
00:57:54 <DuB`> Reaver+sure4 was a bit stiff in what dps combos could be played, but now we have some SERIOUS depth.
00:57:58 <DuB`> I like iiiiiiiit.
00:58:19 <skram> its been 10 minutes and i have not seen a single freakin mccree
00:58:22 <skram> what game is this
00:58:38 <DuB`> lull
00:59:27 <skram> hahah
00:59:36 <skram> this hanzo on hanzo action
01:00:44 <DuB`> Liquid whatchu doin' up there? LUL
01:01:29 <skram> when you kill like 6 dudes as reinhardt its hard to restrain yourself
01:02:04 <DuB`> Heheh
01:02:27 <skram> right now theres 2 mccrees
01:04:14 <DuB`> Yey.
01:05:00 <skram> pretty decent hold though
01:05:29 <DuB`> Yeah.
01:05:39 <DuB`> The strong rush-in with the strong russian.
01:05:43 <skram> I really like that mei is a Thing now
01:05:43 <DuB`> Keke
01:05:48 <DuB`> <3 MEI <3

01:10:06 <DuB`> That's four times this tourney!
01:10:07 <DuB`> FOUR!
01:10:57 <skram> too much reaping
01:11:17 <DuB`> Meta is weird right now, but nanoreaper is consistent.
01:11:26 <DuB`> Everything else is ??????
01:12:16 <skram> oh

16:04:28 <Dot`> skram, i tihnk meph needs to calm down 
16:04:29 <Dot`> https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/56h9v9/someone_suggested_animated_grass/
16:11:48 <Crisium> well cya later gtg
16:12:08 <Dot`> later Crisium <3
16:16:55 <ZK> you still dwarf fortressing?
16:17:42 <Dot`> not right now, but i do
16:18:38 <Runbunny> Dot is becoming a master dwarf.
16:19:24 <Dot`> runbun, one day you will play dorf fort
16:19:58 <Dot`> you can ask reif, its easy
16:22:18 <ZK> reification
16:22:19 <ZK> answer
16:27:19 <Dot`> thats basicly a yes
16:27:53 <Runbunny> O:
16:28:51 <ZK> lack of consent is still a no
16:29:06 <Runbunny> Sapped girls can't say no ZK.
16:29:31 <ZK> but if they dont say yes, its still no
16:30:16 <Runbunny> But in some cases they say yes and it's still a no.
16:30:46 <ZK> they can decide that after the fact tho
16:32:56 <Micen|Droid> Hi Dot
16:33:25 <Micen|Droid> Sorry. Was having to deal with well repair people. You said you needed a Micen.
16:35:09 <ZK> micen, whats your opinion on sc2
16:36:22 <Micen|Droid> Sc2 is okay. Not as nice as having running water after not having it for over a week
16:36:35 <ZK> hmm
16:36:38 <ZK> guess i can accept that
16:36:44 <ZK> whats your opinon on Dot` not watching pony
16:36:55 <Micen|Droid> SHAME. 
16:37:06 <ZK> SHAME. ?
16:37:11 <Micen|Droid> Even in my state of no water I watched it. 
16:37:19 <Micen|Droid> It was really good. 
16:37:39 <Micen|Droid> I call for a public shaming of Dot. 
16:38:47 <Runbunny> Hmm..
16:39:28 <Micen|Droid> Though the slight pitch shifting that happened was strange. But I read it was something due to the change between 29 frames on tvs here in the states and the 25 frame compression for airing overthere. 
16:40:12 <CockRoach|42> .ponyv + s06e23 http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4wohz9
16:41:06 <reification> easy is how i would describe dwarf fortress. hideously unnecessarily complicated is more like it
16:41:17 <reification> i was off baking before so couldn‚Äôt answer
16:43:01 <Micen|Droid> Ooh, what you baking reif? 
16:43:18 <reification> bread
16:43:35 <CockRoach|42> :D
16:43:40 <reification> tomato and parmesan 
16:44:10 <Micen|Droid> Sounds good. Except for the tomato part. 
16:44:58 <reification> do you not like pizza? cause this is like pizza in loaf form
16:45:28 <reification> *assuming it comes out right
16:45:49 <Micen|Droid> Okay I was thinking like bits of tomato in the bread
16:46:19 <Micen|Droid> Tomato needs to be seasoned and in like a soup, marinara or ketchup. 
16:46:58 <Micen|Droid> But if its like pizza. That sounds good. 
16:49:51 <skram> dude no
16:50:18 <skram> tomatos dont need nobody

18:22:53 <Dot`> i did need you
18:22:55 <Dot`> always
18:23:07 <Dot`> but right now, to explain what order the pony ep are in
18:24:26 <Dot`> because im confused
18:24:26 <Dot`> CockRoach, this guy does some fancy dragons http://sandara.deviantart.com/gallery/
18:24:26 <Phearlock> Ok so today there was ep 23
18:24:27 <Phearlock> 24 is next week
18:24:33 <Phearlock> then 25 and 26 are the finale eps
18:24:45 <Phearlock> (which are out in SD online if you want to watch)
18:25:21 <Dot`> so in order to watch all 4 i woud have to wait a week? uk didnt air ALL 4 this week?
18:25:38 <Phearlock> I don't think they aired all 4
18:25:56 <Phearlock> though having seen the finale. I don't think there's anything in ep 23 and 24 that would really like
18:25:59 <Phearlock> change it
18:26:07 <Phearlock> or that would add extra info
18:26:15 <CockRoach|42> Dot`: already watching that one :)

20:30:28 <skram> whats wrong anders
20:30:57 <Runbunny> There's a dude on twitter that draws some really nice stuff. But his last tweet is nearly a month old.
20:31:13 <Runbunny> used to tweet like 10 things a day.
20:31:36 <skram> Maybe he decided that he did not want to waste his life drawing catgirls and futa
20:32:10 <Phearlock> Did he upload stuff to anywhere where there's also like a "last online:" thing?
20:33:01 <Runbunny> No, the primary source is twitter... everything else is outdated. I checked.
20:33:33 <Phearlock> =/
20:35:09 <Runbunny> I am quite disheartened.
