03:09:22 <Bio> feeling nostalgic there mot?
03:11:23 <motbob> i've never heard this song before
05:42:13 <motbob> all right, i still have no cash and need to buy breakfast tomorrow. Let's look through the ol' wallet and see what we can find to pay.
05:42:57 <motbob> Credit car. No, that got stolen in October and is useless now. Business cards from a job interview... I didn't get that job.
05:43:37 <motbob> supermarket card for discounts... no. A card that lets me gamble at the local casino... maybe this is why I have no cash?
05:44:54 <motbob> supermarket card from Tennessee, 1000 miles away... even less useful. A card loaded with credits that I can use in the laundry room. My driver's license.
05:45:06 <motbob> A bus pass.
05:46:24 <motbob> Debit card... this got stolen/fraud'd last week which is why I'm in this mess. A student ID with $0.57 on it. Not enough for a candy bar.
05:46:40 <motbob> A picture of my little sister.
05:47:08 <motbob> A gift card for Shell gasoline stations! I can work with this. I bet they sell food at Shell gas stations. But do they sell breakfast food?
05:47:56 <motbob> A health insurance card for a health plan I don't belong to. A health insurance card to a plan I do belong to.
05:48:13 <motbob> That's all... I guess I'm eating at Shell tomorrow
05:59:28 <motbob> Update: I found a Barnes and Noble gift card
05:59:44 <motbob> Thy sell coffee and stuff at Barnes and Noble
06:00:16 <motbob> But they only open at 9...
06:05:13 <motbob> Update 2: The Shell card is quite old and covered with gunk on the back. Unclear whether it would pass a card reader.
07:03:19 <Camail> the misadventures of digital currency, or lack thereof

11:52:10 <Rawr|Fone> So I'm gonna wait at least a year

14:37:35 <DoT`> im not sure how it relates to AC -> DC -> AC converters
14:37:41 <DoT`> but thats ok
14:38:12 <carcinisation> well a tachometer measures rpm like a speedometer
14:38:29 <DoT`> so it does
14:38:32 <carcinisation> so i'm gonna assume a tachogenerator makes rpm
14:38:38 <DoT`> but it shouldmesure tacos
14:39:13 <carcinisation> that can be your great nobel prize winning invention
14:39:29 <DoT`> i have a prurpose in life now, whoo!
14:40:10 <carcinisation> i'm sure bio can help with testing

14:45:59 <DoT`> you figure out the xkcd tihng?
14:46:09 <carcinisation> oh i looked it up and tachogenerator is just another word for tachometer D:
14:47:21 <DoT`> probably changed depending on which way round its used or somethning weird
14:47:38 <DoT`> engineers are not great at naming conventions
14:48:03 <DuB`> But they are great at tacos?
14:48:17 <DoT`> they are all abou tprecision in tacos

14:51:37 <Phearlock> yeah
14:51:47 <Phearlock> bunch of ppl been freaking out about it
14:53:16 <Phearlock> China banned talking about it so that's a +1 for it being worth being talked about.
14:53:36 <DoT`> LOL
14:55:58 <carcinisation> i gather it mostly implicate our political enemies so i expect it to get a lot of play
14:56:03 <carcinisation> *implicates
14:56:38 <Phearlock> wait who are our political enemies?
14:57:38 <carcinisation> by our i mean western political esablishment so russia etc.
14:58:28 <carcinisation> personally i recommend not making political enemies :p
15:00:33 <Phearlock> also seems to be a lot of divegrass. and a bunch of icelands current government
15:01:53 <carcinisation> well given what we've learned about FIFA, divegrass corruption can't be that big a suprise :p
15:01:59 <Phearlock> no =D
15:02:13 <Phearlock> A lot of these are "well this isn't that surprising"
15:03:38 <DoT`> well in most cases isnt it more "now we have proof to do sometihng" rather than just "we know your crrrupt but cant do anything"
15:03:38 <carcinisation> yep iceland most suprising i would say. georgia/ukraine/middle east as expected
15:04:24 <carcinisation> well we have proof dot, but i wouldn't be sure that something will happen
15:04:43 <DoT`> well thast still it :/  but its something
15:05:02 <Phearlock> At least in icelands case stuff might happen
15:06:25 <carcinisation> argentinia might be interesting too
