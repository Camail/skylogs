22:22:31 <Micen> things come up. Also i need to get my drafting table cleaned off again so i can draw comfortablly
22:22:38 <Micen> comfortably 
22:23:01 <Dot`> again
22:23:40 <Micen> yes again.
22:53:12 <ZK> i won a game as terran
22:53:29 <Dot`> \o/
22:55:09 <Phearlock> Time to nerf bunkers again
22:55:22 <ZK> that was great
22:58:21 <motbob> i have been reading final fantasy xv previews
22:58:51 <motbob> apparantly the movie and anime are useful to watch in order to understand what is going on in the game
22:59:36 <motbob> sort of like the Kingdom Hearts phenomenon where not playing the GBA game in between Kingdom Hearts 1+2 made it pretty difficult to understand what was going on
23:06:29 <Dot`> inteirstinng choice, but i suppose the other options are off if you think thier main draw is from ppl that enjoy the frnachise
23:14:11 * Bio licks Dot`
23:14:33 <Dot`> Bio pon
23:14:39 <Dot`> you better yet?
23:14:48 <Bio> nope
23:21:20 <Dot`> avoid people form now on Bio
23:22:33 <Bio> I already do that!
23:24:03 <Phearlock> I am a little worried Bio, are you sure you're getting enough rest to get better?
23:25:18 <Bio> I'm trying. I didn't go into work this morning, slept in.
23:25:26 <Bio> I'm taking my meds religiously
23:26:02 <Bio> not sure what more I can do
23:26:35 <Bio> I'm... better than I was last week, but I'm not fully healthy either
