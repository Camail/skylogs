12:15:44 <motbob> hey
12:15:52 <motbob> why do i find civilization so boring
12:15:57 <motbob> what am i missing in the game
12:16:34 <motbob> i see a list of buildings and then i build one and then i make some units and then they maybe win a battle or maybe lose and I just don't really understand what's going on
12:17:51 <motbob> i feel like i'm missing out on a cultural experience
12:19:31 <DoT`> Phearlock, you seem like the one who might know
12:20:31 <Phearlock> I do like the civ games. Though I find them like the most chill strategy game possible and generally use them to relax.
12:21:42 -!- Mag_ [~Mag@107.92-221-99.customer.lyse.net] has joined #tlponies
12:21:49 <Phearlock> Though I've mostly played the newer Civ games (5, BE) and some offshoots (Galactic civilization 2 & 3)
12:22:00 <DoT`> I havnt played it in years, but thats was probably it for me, it was casual stratergy, i could afk at any time
12:22:36 <CockRoach|42> like you take breaks from civ games?
12:22:47 <CockRoach|42> maybe once every 24 hour or so
12:22:55 <Phearlock> lol
12:23:04 <DoT`> haha
12:23:43 <DoT`> look, i got hooked on stardew valley for 2 weeks, i dont even trust my judgment on games
12:24:48 <Phearlock> I will say though that, Civ games are often the sort of games where you often have to create your own fun.
12:25:48 <Phearlock> Example: spread the religion of sunbutt worship to your entire home continent.
12:27:29 <DoT`> lol
12:31:20 <motbob> civ V really nailed the opening narration for civs. Makes me pumped up to play whoever I'm playing as
12:31:31 <Phearlock> Then people do gimmicks like massive AI battles
12:31:32 <Phearlock> https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale
12:32:01 <Phearlock> People doing background lore, polandball art, power rankings etc of this one =)
12:32:36 <Phearlock> again, good example of making your own fun if you're tired of vanilla civ
12:32:43 <Phearlock> or can't get into the vanilla stuff
12:34:12 <Phearlock> I still think galactic civilization 2 was my favorite Civ game.
12:34:27 <Phearlock> though 3 is still very good
12:35:19 <Phearlock> Then probably 5, then BE
12:35:30 <Phearlock> I never played 2-4
12:35:32 <Phearlock> or 1
12:36:08 <DoT`> BE felt kinda weak to me, very limited
12:36:36 <Phearlock> yeah, really good ideas.
12:36:45 <Phearlock> but didn't really have the content
12:37:10 <CockRoach|42> i preferred civ and civ 2
12:39:38 <Phearlock> I will say I really liked the grid combat system of 5 and BE though.
12:40:31 <motbob> civ 1 was great because I was 7 years old or something when I played it

12:40:41 <motbob> so any video game was good
12:41:05 <motbob> i built stuff w/o knowing what it did and all my ships died because i sent them out to sea
12:41:50 <motbob> i once tried to pacify an AI opponent by irrigating his land but it didn't work and he declared war anyway
12:42:12 <DoT`> rude
12:42:17 <motbob> i was not a hardcore geopolitician as a child

12:45:15 <Rawr|Fone> I was not born when the first civ game came out
12:45:47 <CockRoach|42> :O
12:55:19 <motbob> looking back, my dad was a serious gamer. Myst, Civ 1, Sim City 2000...
12:55:34 <motbob> But he bought Civ 2 and just ended up playing only that for 8 years
12:55:50 <motbob> Then he moved on to AOE II

21:46:58 * Bio prods DuB`
21:47:20 * DuB` cattleprods Bio.
21:47:25 <Bio> harumph
21:47:26 <DuB`> BZZAP.
21:47:30 * Bio slaps DuB` around a bit with a large trout
21:48:52 * DuB` grills some trout.
21:50:31 <Bio> go lay on the ground and feel like garbage
21:50:37 <DuB`> Every day.
21:50:51 <Bio> you have to be nice to me, I donated blood
21:51:44 <DoT`> can i have some bio?
21:52:09 <carcinisation> well bio i was just reading about how it's probably the best thing you can do for your health
21:52:26 <carcinisation> especially if you are murican
21:52:40 <DoT`> too much blood is bad for you
21:52:56 <carcinisation> less so if you live in denmark or sweden
21:53:04 <Phearlock> I saw the pretty princess DoT
21:53:09 <Phearlock> praise sunbutt =3
21:53:14 <carcinisation> it's the iron dotties
21:53:49 <Bio> i'm not using all my blood surely
21:53:53 <Bio> someone else can have some
21:54:07 <carcinisation> you make it back again really fast
21:55:44 <DuB`> There's a place that'll pay you for plasma like 50 yards from my apartment.
21:55:58 <DuB`> Could pay rent with that if I go the max amount per month. :P
21:56:01 <DoT`> pay?
21:56:04 <DoT`> time to be rich
21:56:05 <DuB`> Yah.
21:56:17 <DuB`> ... I'm already tired and faint all the time though, dot!
21:56:26 <carcinisation> they don't pay over here dot. it's the nhs
21:56:33 <DoT`> pff, money!
21:56:41 <DoT`> yea, i thougth so :/
21:56:50 <carcinisation> but on the plus side they won't charge you if you need it
21:56:55 <DoT`> i doubt they want my short blood anyway
21:57:04 <Camail> there are other fluids people will pay for
21:58:04 <Camail> or donate bone marrow and feel like a hero and garbage at the same time
21:58:38 <carcinisation> you could travel to iran and sell one of your kidneys legally
21:58:55 <DoT`> isnt that excruciating cam
21:58:59 <Camail> very
21:59:14 <Camail> also you have to prepare
21:59:17 <Camail> for like 2 months
21:59:26 <carcinisation> well normally if your bone marrow is coming out things are pretty bad
22:00:12 <Camail> they basically get college kids whoa re naive/altruistic, it a weird mixture of genuine kindness and manipulation
22:00:25 <Camail> at least they did at my school
22:01:36 <DoT`> lol, ouch
22:05:20 <DuB`> If I can find a not-too-exhausting summer job I'll probably do the plasma thing.
22:05:22 <DuB`> $$$
22:06:53 <Camail> you cna also steal other people's plasma
22:06:56 <CockRoach|42> http://strachattack.deviantart.com/art/Punk-Dash-600280571
22:07:30 <Camail> how do they extract plasma without getting bloodcells
22:07:40 <Bio> they put it back
22:08:07 <Bio> draw out some blood, centrifuge the plasma out, put the blood back in
22:08:18 <Bio> takes about an hour
22:09:40 <Rawr|Phone> I have to get up in 7 hours but I'm not even close to tired
22:09:47 <Rawr|Phone> üò¢üò¢üò¢
22:10:21 <DoT`> if only oyu had a book to read rawr
22:10:37 <Rawr|Phone> If only
22:11:00 <Rawr|Phone> But I guess I wouldn't sleep in that case either
22:13:02 <DuB`> Rarrr!
22:13:04 <DuB`> Slepp plis.
22:13:26 <Camail> oh god I'm reading ana rticle of plasma donation that's just....incredibly unethical in its slanting
22:13:38 <Camail> to the point of editting its own text for the selected big quotes
22:13:46 <Camail> and its like the top hit on google
22:16:57 <Camail> yea fuck that article, the word choice reeks of over editting and sensationalism that make me unable to trust the contents of the article at all
22:17:08 <Camail> nothing makes me more annoyed with real life than shitty writers

23:14:59 <carcinisation> dub is correct
23:15:21 <DuB`> They had it so easy, too.
23:15:30 <DuB`> They just had to make a full suit of samurai armor Genji.

23:15:49 <DuB`> Haaaa

23:16:06 <Bio> http://i.imgur.com/qyLowEz.jpg
23:16:22 <DuB`> Oh look, she still has a butt.
23:16:25 <Bio> Confirmed tracer still has a curvacious bootay
23:16:33 <DuB`> Whaddaya know.
23:17:00 <DoT`> still butt
23:17:09 <DoT`> tracer may be cam
23:18:17 <DuB`> Well, it's only genji's first.
23:18:20 <DuB`> Many more to come.
23:19:25 <Camail> did they actually go through with the pose change
23:19:35 <DuB`> Seems so.
23:19:43 <Camail> idc really, the new one is better
23:19:54 <Camail> over the shoulder is a rather boring pose anyway,t hats the legitimate complaint
23:20:06 <DuB`> http://i.imgur.com/k4E8gby.jpg
23:20:22 <Camail> someone sohuld complain about every pose
23:20:31 <Camail> so that they try harder on all of them and make them all great
23:20:47 <carcinisation> i'm sure they will now
23:20:56 <Camail> what are the gonna do about widow
23:20:56 <DoT`> i think very few care that they changed it, its just the fact they took post and used that as the reason
23:21:02 <Camail> just rmeove her from the game
23:21:24 <Camail> as a fan of streetfighter, this is hilarious
23:21:29 <DuB`> Too shmexy spider lady.
23:21:49 <DuB`> Yeah... meanwhile laura and mika.
23:21:53 <Camail> my game has literal panty shots, overwatch is for babies
23:22:03 <Camail> mika is w/e, laura is the worst
23:22:15 <DoT`> bastion over the shoulder pose please
23:22:19 <Camail> laura has nothing going for her in 2 out of 3 costumes
23:22:29 <Camail> just tits
23:22:43 <Camail> the underboob on her alt costume looks awful, too
23:23:02 <Camail> the way they modeled the breast to meet the rib cage looks fucking weird
23:23:25 <Camail> like she had double implants and the skin is about to burst
23:23:27 <Bio> boobies
23:24:03 <Camail> laura's premium judo costume sohuld be her main costume, and they should never get more lewd than that
23:24:17 <Camail> or at least give us one normals costume option
23:26:34 <Camail> but ok overwatch kiddies, if you can't handle seeing a butt, i understand
23:26:42 <DuB`> Oh, OW ranked play.
23:26:43 <DuB`> Kewl.
23:27:02 <Camail> pray to god you dont let your kids on google images with safe search off

23:27:57 <DuB`> PogChamp
23:28:08 <Camail> tfw dub will be better at an fps than me cuz i wont be playing OW
