03:19:13 <DuB`zZz> ???
03:42:55 <motbob> you shouldn't all your wife a bitch camail
03:43:47 <Camail> it was a moment of weakness
03:43:53 <Camail> i felt betrayed
03:51:08 <motbob> my laptop's fan shut off while i slept
03:51:37 <motbob> and so, when I woke up and started to do things, the computer chugged and when I checked the CPU temp it was ~85C
03:52:06 <motbob> very scary, but when I restarted the computer, the fan turned back on. I wonder what happened.
03:55:21 <Camail> thats weird
03:55:44 <Camail> well, its only a problem if it happens twice!
04:25:26 <Camail> i figured out a puzzle before being spoiled, yay
05:01:02 <Phearlock> If it's any sort of modern CPU it should have built in auto-shutdown once it gets too high (usually around 95-98C)
05:01:18 <Phearlock> But yeah not a good feeling.
05:01:29 <Phearlock> Had to replace my old laptop fan once already =P
05:02:17 <Phearlock> If it does start to fail more often motbob you could get one of those cheapo USB pads with cooling fans you can just have the laptop sitting on motbob

19:08:14 <Camail> i dont care anymore
19:08:18 <Camail> i dont need money at all
19:08:23 <DoT|Phone> to much money
19:08:59 <Crisium> what if you buy membership to walmart after you finish community center
19:09:23 <Camail> i suppose having the bundles completed is the finale
19:10:01 <Camail> i dunno
19:10:05 <Camail> why dont you find outy
19:10:28 <Crisium> gonna take me a while to get there
19:11:42 <Camail> eyup
19:11:51 <Crisium> just got to the desert
19:11:56 <Crisium> i want desert fish
19:12:02 <Crisium> its harder than the damn legendy to catch
19:12:05 <Crisium> calm down fish bro
19:12:42 <Camail> also i confirmed you can not go above 8 hearts for romance options at all
19:12:48 <Camail> any time you do its a weird rounding error
19:12:54 <Camail> i had haley at 9 but never 10
19:13:02 <Camail> after pumping loved gifts into all of them
19:13:05 <Crisium> i have harvey at 9
19:13:06 <Crisium> lol
19:13:09 <Camail> then getting the bulletin bundle reward
19:13:16 <Camail> yea, it happens
19:13:20 <Camail> but he can never go higher
19:13:28 <Camail> and if he ever drops to 8 he is gonna stay there
19:13:28 <Crisium> and sebastian
19:13:33 <Crisium> my man friends like me
19:14:12 <Crisium> oh i got the sandfish easy
19:14:20 <Crisium> i wonder what kinda fish was kicking my ass then
19:14:24 <Crisium> cause it womped me
19:14:48 <Camail> yea thats only in the bundle because its a "secret" area
19:14:59 <Camail> it was the other desert fish
19:15:11 <Camail> there's two and the second one has close to max difficulty
19:15:13 <Camail> if not max
19:15:13 <Crisium> meh, no bundle no worry
19:15:17 <Camail> true
19:15:24 <Camail> i might got back to get 100% fish
19:15:28 <Camail> I'm only missing like 4
19:15:37 <Crisium> i think it was max cause i just caught the snow legendary and it was just as hard maybe harder for desert
19:15:39 <Camail> got all the legendary...so there's only 2 fish that are hard
19:17:08 <Crisium> fuck lol
19:17:15 <Crisium> got killed in skull cavern
19:17:18 <Crisium> first time i died
19:17:37 <Camail> yea, same here
19:17:45 <Camail> but it'll only happen once
19:17:48 <Crisium> 1000g and -6 items waaaa
19:17:51 <Camail> the serpent's have dumb hitboxes
19:18:01 <Camail> but their hurtbox is also extended

19:18:18 <Crisium> well you can buy a better one at guild?
19:18:22 <Camail> do you have 25k on hand
19:18:22 <Crisium> ill probably need it anyway

19:19:02 <Crisium> no i only have 2
19:19:08 <Camail> yea i ended up getting that sword, it helped a lot
19:19:15 <Crisium> and iv ran thru the last 5 floors for a while of the mines
19:19:17 <Camail> you should probably get the other two
19:19:22 <Camail> which do you need

19:19:51 <Camail> earlier levels have earlier scrolls
19:20:07 <Crisium> thatd explain why i got 4 twice
19:20:17 <Camail> digging nets a small chance at an artifact

21:40:17 <Camail> because dub, when i harvest my crops there isn't an 85% chance that nothing is on the end of the stalk
21:40:48 <DuB`> :P
21:40:57 <skram> what a shitty game
21:41:00 <skram> no excitement
21:41:45 <DuB`> "Oh look, a parsnip plant. Let me guess... probably a parsnip from it?"
21:41:50 <DuB`> Psh.
21:42:18 <skram> gotta get dat ancient legendary parsnip with perfect rolls
21:44:12 <Camail> this game has serioues issues with cutscenes
21:44:20 <Camail> I've lost 3 cutscenes because of overlapping
21:49:57 <DoT`> :/

22:03:58 <Crisium> cut scene triggers overlap, game chooses 1 and then the others are lost Camail?
22:05:12 <DoT`> that why i am not marrying till after winter as i cant get the 10 heart cutscene in winter
22:08:17 <Camail> it looks like it, cris
22:08:29 <Camail> thats not what I'm talking about dot
22:08:38 <Camail> we're talkinga bout cutscenes happening int he same screen load
22:08:54 <DoT`> what
22:08:58 <DoT`> lol
22:09:16 <Camail> I had a shane cutscene and a community center cutscene happen when i went into town
22:09:20 <Camail> the shane cutscene happened
22:09:23 <Camail> the CC one didnt
22:09:36 <Camail> but after looking at my save file, it said i had seen the cc scene
22:09:47 <Camail> i had to delete that flag, then re-enter town
22:09:50 <Camail> then it ran
22:10:11 <Camail> it will trigger all the cutscenes when an area loads, but then show one
22:11:33 <DoT`> i wonder if this 1 guy who made the gmae is now getting help with the work
22:13:27 <Crisium> the associations my brain makes
22:13:42 <Crisium> this song has come into my head with all my stardu playin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHZygqc7-NU
22:14:41 <Camail> thats not too far off
22:14:53 <Camail> especially because there is a song that has the same feel to it
22:15:19 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2Oj0iqra9Y
22:15:22 <Camail> this is what i think of
22:15:31 <Camail> they all have the same feel
22:15:35 <Crisium> yea
22:15:36 <Camail> same kind of music
22:15:38 <Crisium> that one takes me back too
22:15:44 <Camail> ikr
22:16:14 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RvzG73x9CM
22:16:23 <Camail> clearly some sort of inspiration
22:16:44 <Crisium> ya, i see relations to zelda and hm both there
22:16:51 <Camail> especially https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk6tA6OVqvk
22:17:04 <Camail> I feel HM the most
22:17:17 <Camail> which isn't a surprise
22:17:32 <Crisium> yeah Cloud Country beginning like the beginning of the ranch
22:17:45 <Camail> this is literally a harvest moon clone
22:17:51 <Camail> so it makes sense that it has that kind of music
22:17:59 <Crisium> yup
22:18:55 <Camail> welp, i think I might be done with stardew for quite awhile
22:19:05 <Camail> at least until year 2 and 3 content gets added
22:19:26 <Camail> considering the success i believe he'll be working on this game a lot
22:19:34 <Camail> once multiplayer comes out who knows
22:19:57 <Camail> depending on how intensive server resource costs are i could add a dedicated server
22:19:57 <Crisium> i really want the community center finished, which i will be able to in summer 2
22:20:02 <Camail> unlikely, but its possible
22:20:07 <Camail> this game is super lightweight
22:20:26 <Camail> yea summer 2 seems to be the most common
22:20:35 <Camail> i finished mine on fall 3 because apples
22:20:37 <Crisium> i dont know how some ppl play for years and years
22:20:49 <Camail> yea
22:20:56 <Camail> its like minecraft
22:20:59 <Camail> make pretty farms
22:21:26 <Camail> 100%ing this game takes awhile
22:21:28 <Crisium> ya my aint so pretty
22:21:34 <Crisium> whatever gets me my cash is pretty enough
22:21:40 <Camail> mine is ogranized but not pretty
22:21:47 <Camail> it was pretty when i was farming starfruit
22:21:59 <Camail> 60% of the farm space was pretty purples and blues
22:23:26 <Crisium> main reason i need summer 3 is for those 3 apples
22:23:29 <Crisium> summer 2*
22:23:39 <Crisium> oh apples are fall?
22:23:51 <Crisium> never mind lol
22:23:51 <Crisium> fall 2 it is
22:23:56 <Crisium> or can you grow tree in greenhouse?
22:28:15 <DoT`> or pray to bat gods
22:28:30 <Crisium> oh it can
22:28:42 <Crisium> i cant get greenhouse until spring 2
22:28:59 <Crisium> but i should be able to get apples before summer is over hopefully
22:29:21 <Crisium> i need 5 gold parsnips
22:29:31 <Crisium> i didnt pay much attention to community center first time around
22:29:34 <Crisium> so i just gave all them away
22:29:45 <Crisium> same with all my gold melons
22:29:55 <Crisium> but luckily you dont need all of them
22:30:32 <Crisium> i will be planting like 60 parsnips day 1 tho lol
22:33:15 <Camail> spring crops really suck
22:34:38 <Crisium> i still need money for barns and coop upgrades for a rabbit and pig which you also need
22:34:46 <Crisium> winters almost over and im dirt poor
22:34:48 <Crisium> dang
22:35:16 <Crisium> maybe i should hit skull cave hard, i only tried it once
22:35:31 <Crisium> minerals
22:36:33 <Camail> go to the skull caverns
22:37:10 <Camail> get tons of diamonds and gems and stuff
