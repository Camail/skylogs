03:01:38 <Camail> most ships actually only have a specific range of angles where you can aim which i didnt know
03:02:01 <Camail> i thought i would like the super mobile ship but it can only really fire at things its facing which is not what i want to do

15:55:01 <DoT`> cam, how was dreadnaught 
15:57:09 <skrma> dot y u no overwatch
15:59:02 <skrma> Also, did we set the time for next session?
15:59:12 <DoT`> AMG
15:59:15 <DoT`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ZgyNoHtjw
16:00:03 <DoT`> if  said i was tryign to get stuff done before more overwatch would you believe me?
16:00:12 <DoT`> no we didnt
16:00:32 <skrma> Be an adult DoT`. Disregard responsibilities and play zarya
16:00:50 <DoT`> i have played a fair ammount of zarya
16:01:06 <Camail> DoT`  really fun, but server issues
16:01:48 <Camail> zk said he would want to do thrusday if we were doing another one this week before his job starts
16:02:08 <DoT`> i can do thursday, imagone that
16:03:49 <Camail> I would kinda like to get to level 3 before the schedule starts getting complicated
16:04:09 <DoT`> well if we can avoid further random encounters, maybe
16:04:15 <skrma> We will get 3 on next session I would assume
16:04:44 <skrma> Anyway I would like to have like a regular session on sundays if at all possible
16:04:52 <skrma> I know hours are kinda wonky
16:05:23 <DoT`> Phearlock
16:05:28 <Phearlock>  dot
16:05:43 <DoT`> we also happen to require your input on this
16:05:45 <Camail> the problem with having 7 people, no idea when everyone will be open
16:06:02 <Phearlock> thursday will work for me
16:06:12 <Phearlock> sundays will also work for me
16:07:04 <skrma> I dont start work much until like a month and change so anytime is probably good for me
16:07:44 <skrma> ...They usually let me know a few hours beforehand if I need to work anyway.
16:08:44 <Camail> the only thing now is that combat is insanely slow
16:09:00 <Camail> not just because its 2 more characters, but that means more enemies as well
16:09:17 <Camail> so its taking roughly twice as long per encounter, maybe a little less
16:09:32 <DoT`> i think that one was very slow because a) first for 2 of them b) micen wasnt even there
16:09:52 <Camail> yea btw anyone who didnt hear
16:10:00 <Camail> we are never letting that slide again
16:10:10 <DoT`> i tihnk as you said we employ a limit on a turn 
16:10:11 <Camail> if you arent at your computer you arent playing
16:10:12 <Camail> its too hard
16:10:23 <Phearlock> that's fine
16:10:24 <skrma> agreed
16:10:37 <Camail> also you only get 15 seconds on your turn
16:10:57 <Camail> its gonna be a hard limit and we'll see if it needs adjusting
16:11:14 <Camail> but I'm also only spending like 5 seconds per turn
16:11:45 <Camail> but if we want to make any enjoyable progress at all combat has to be fast
16:11:45 <DoT`> is there anyway to end our own turn? move the turn counter to the next in line?
16:11:55 <Camail> no
16:12:01 <Camail> I can easily keep track of that
16:12:22 <Camail> it might take you a bit of time to roll the dice
16:12:31 <Camail> but in terms of decision making I'm not leaving much time
16:12:53 <Camail> giving you time to plan during other people's turns, react to watch just happened, make your decisions and roll
16:13:17 <Camail> anyway afk for quite awhile
16:13:22 <ZK> Another thing you could do is make all the rolls for enemies on the same turn, at least when it's a mob of enemies like last game. So you roll all and see if they hit, move em all at the same time, and that can accelerate a lot
16:13:47 <ZK> Maybe have stronger chars seperate, but say all the grunts at once
16:14:57 <DoT`> hm, class seperated intitive sounds like its worth a try
16:15:03 <ZK> mines of phandelver also recommended not doing attack rolls, and just doing average dmg each time
16:15:04 <DoT`> class/power
16:15:08 <DoT`> thing
16:31:16 <carcinisation> won my free twister tix and the full tilt stream giveaway :D
16:37:09 <carcinisation> but still no overwatch beta...
16:37:14 <DoT`> aww
16:37:20 <DoT`> well there is no more beta keys
16:37:31 <carcinisation> at least it's moved me from saline to brackish :p
16:37:40 <DoT`> beta is over, only preorder now gets to play and the 1 person they give a key to
16:37:47 <DoT`> haha
16:38:16 <carcinisation> there were a bunch of ppl giving away keys on streams at launch yesterday evening
16:38:37 <DoT`> i suppose, thats possible

16:53:25 <DoT`> irc and overwatch are having issues, nothign else
16:53:55 <carcinisation> so just the important things
16:54:34 <Runbunny> Dot check the catgirls quick!
16:54:46 <Runbunny> Are they safe !?!?1
16:55:06 <DoT`> all gone
16:55:45 <carcinisation> since when do you have catgirls dot?!
16:55:55 <Runbunny> Oh you didn't know?
16:56:11 <carcinisation> he must have hidden them when i visited D:
16:56:34 <carcinisation> rude
17:01:09 <Camail> ZK  the problem with that is it causes serious imbalance
17:01:18 <Camail> if they all act at the same time they can kill a PC easily
17:01:37 <Camail> if there are 4 archers then what happens when they fuck up a spellcaster
17:02:19 <Camail> the time sink isn't on my side, it took very little time to do each enemy, they're attacks are really straight forward
17:03:05 <Camail> and putting them all on the same turn...i just dont like that at all, I don't see a real benefit other than convenience
17:03:17 <Camail> but we have easy auto calculating tools
17:03:29 <Camail> even when i had to control 7 enemies it still wasnt bad
17:03:38 <ZK> Eh, I personally felt a time sink there.
17:04:06 <Camail> is it worth them killing you
17:04:18 <ZK> I mean, they don't have to aim for the same person because they play at the same time
17:04:24 <Camail> it makes encounters completely unrealistic
17:04:25 <ZK> you just roll and play them all at once
17:04:57 <Camail> I'm not convinced, i dislike it too much
17:05:04 <ZK> Kk, your choice.
17:05:17 <Camail> there's no reason every group of archers would decide to not focus fire
17:05:27 <Camail> you completely eliminate an entire battle strategy for the sake of a few minutes
17:05:43 <Camail> which makes combat that much more linear for btoh sides
17:06:13 <Camail> the problem was that there were just a shit ton of weak enemies
17:06:21 <Camail> i just messed up with the encounter composition
17:07:39 <Bio> pon
17:08:06 <DoT`> Bio
17:08:12 <DoT`> is it overwatch time?
17:08:53 <ZK> Well, to me, combat is a part of the experience, but smaller encounters like that which don't change the story much can be done quicker.
17:09:43 <ZK> Like, everyone has their preference in DnD, my favorite part is the storytelling, combat is fine, but it's not my preferred part
17:10:14 <ZK> I've played Pen and paper with theater of the mind style, and it was also a lot of fun even when there were a ton of minions
17:11:59 <ZK> Way I see it, some combats can be big tactical fests, and others can be much shorter and are there to keep our minds alert, like that bandit attack.
17:12:13 -!- Dott` [~DoT@0541c64f.skybroadband.com] has joined #tlponies
17:12:54 <Camail> I'm mostly concerned with the world itself as well, but the thing is that these people in this world would have a game plan, they have a strategy they've been using forever. Its very common to choose a target, one probably in robes, and focus on him
17:13:02 <Camail> there is a story, a mentality behind ana ttackers strategy
17:13:14 <Camail> just because its expressed through combat doesnt mean it isnt story
17:13:36 <Dott`> focus the wizard is always a sound strat
17:13:46 <Camail> you are depriving the enemy from their minds if you ignore the narrative combat, regardless of if it has grand narrative relevance
17:13:49 <Camail> this isnt to say you're wrong
17:14:02 <Camail> but I do want to defend my perspective on combat from the view of valuing story telling
17:14:08 <ZK> No for sure, there's a preference and why there are many ways of doing stuff.
17:14:23 <Camail> i dont think your value of story telling necessarily means you should simplify combat
17:14:27 <Camail> thats all
17:15:31 <Camail> I've expressly made the campaign as non-gamy as i can being a new dm, but I'm going to respect whatever intelligence the NPCs have, and in doing so i would probably kill one of you in a single turn if many situations
17:15:40 <Camail> unless its mindless beats
17:15:47 <Camail> specifically designed to go for whats closest
17:16:35 <Camail> like, the bandits that almost ruined you, and they didn't even work together that much
17:16:50 <Camail> if i went strictly by the campaign book it probably would've been worse
17:16:52 <ZK> Sure, I agree on them all attacking the wizard or me or what not.  But I don't think having all the archers play at once will take away from that. And working together could very well be all attacking at once
17:17:17 <Camail> but I'd rathe give the archer a chance to run away, or a melee unit a chance to run up and stop them
17:17:26 <Camail> give the characters a chance to react tot he enemy
17:17:34 <Camail> rather than just taking turns like a JRPG
17:17:50 <Camail> errr
17:17:53 <Camail> give the wizard*
17:18:28 <Phearlock> As long as we're not dealing with more than like 8-10 enemies I prefer they all get to act individually
17:19:11 <Phearlock> Gives a single enemy a lot more personality (I'm still sad that boss bandit didn't get away)
17:19:33 <Camail> yea the thought behind that random encouter was this "bandits wouldnt ambush unless they had the numbers advantage"
17:19:42 <Camail> unfortunately i added one too many high-level enemies
17:19:54 <Camail> and made it an ambush round
17:20:20 <Camail> also i sohuld've had them knock you out
17:20:25 <ZK> I agree for more important units, it's mostly for smaller units (all the grunts), just to accelerate combat, so we can move on to other things quicker. That way we still get the combat, but get to move on to other stuff faster.
17:20:25 <Camail> because they were trying to rob you not kill you
17:20:45 <Camail> yea we just see the importance of combat differently
17:20:51 <Camail> I believe you can express a lot through combat
17:20:52 <ZK> pretty much, which is fine
17:20:55 <Phearlock> Yeah I meant in general, not specifically that encounter.
17:21:05 <Camail> but as a writer i enjoy being descriptive and showing personality through action
17:21:10 <Phearlock> I like the way it is
17:21:48 -!- DoT` [~DoT@0541c64f.skybroadband.com] has joined #tlponies
17:21:54 <Phearlock> At least when fighting things that have a mind of their own
17:22:03 <DoT`> :/
17:22:10 <Phearlock> Like even if it's a lowly bandit it's still a human and there's a lot of room for expression there
17:22:14 <Phearlock> if it's like, 20 rats
17:22:22 <Phearlock> Yeah dont' worry, bunch them up into groups of 5
17:22:28 <Phearlock> or 10
17:22:42 <Camail> I see rho as a reserved fighter with quick, precise strikes at the enemies core to tear them up from within, bardum is a vicous brute who would rather cleave you in half with a greatsword than use a shield, but will relent if he needs to
17:22:52 <Camail> these kinds of things actually let you lean something about the character
17:23:05 <Camail> how you fight, and how you describe it, tells you a lot about a person
17:23:16 <Camail> Vanessa, even though you know very little aobut her, but she reveled in burning a guy alive
17:23:26 <Camail> and getting vengence, inflicting pain on those who wronged her
17:23:30 <Camail> these were in combat expressions
17:23:40 <ZK> I mean, my way all that changes is that they have the same init, and act as a unit.
17:23:40 <Camail> it was story telling
17:23:57 <Camail> this point isn't about the intit anymore
17:24:05 <Camail> its about the value of storytelling through combat
17:24:14 <Camail> because thats where the real disagreement is
17:24:18 <Camail> and its more of a discussion
17:24:30 <Camail> i just wanted to show you how i view combat and why i enjoy it so much
17:24:54 <ZK> I mean, that's the only thing I would change. I agree in story through combat, but often it takes a long time between turns to get back to our characters.
17:25:23 <Camail> and I'm saying that its compromised if i have to play the enemies differently by grouping init
17:25:36 <Camail> like i said, if i dont just want to outright murder someone
17:26:04 <Camail> maybe a players turn is sandwiched inbetween two enemies, rather than getting attacked by both, he can disengage and rearrange
17:26:10 <Camail> or he can willfully stay in the middle
17:26:12 <Camail> and take all comers
17:26:31 <Camail> that small split second choice means that you are either a tactical fighter or a tank, or a raging barbarian
17:27:09 <Camail> you take away the reactive dimension of combat, the split second decisions that help define your character
17:27:18 <Camail> which is important to me
17:27:23 <Camail> and therefor not worth simplifying
17:29:24 <ZK> I can see that and agree with you. Still would like to find a way if possible to make combat faster.
17:30:17 <DoT`> Bio
17:30:45 <Camail> yea I'm just gonna go faster
17:30:50 <Camail> and enforce a player time limit
17:30:52 <Camail> maybe not 15 seconds
17:30:57 <Camail> i dunno, we'll figure it out
17:31:15 <Camail> dont take that last encouter as a standard to measure tho
17:31:20 <Camail> there were multiple toher things wrong with it
17:31:26 <Camail> that won't happen again
17:31:38 <ZK> like what?
17:32:58 <Camail> I'd rather not reveal the cogs, but it was a few things on my end
17:33:14 <Camail> the most obvious was that it was an ambush
17:33:32 <ZK> Hm, why would that make it take longer?
17:33:36 <Phearlock> the last-last encounter (bandit fight v2) was fine really.
17:33:38 <Camail> which let them tie up the party in melee range too quickly
17:33:48 <Camail> yea 
17:33:54 <Camail> Thats kinda what the first should've been
17:34:03 <Phearlock> There'll always be a couple of quick stops like the first time someone's using a certain spell
17:34:28 <Camail> ZK  i forced most of the party to focus on the most difficult to kill enemies, which pushed the party to its limit
17:34:34 <Camail> and exhausted the party resources
17:34:42 <Camail> there are other factors as well
17:34:46 <Camail> but again, dont really want to talk about them
17:35:10 <ZK> kk

19:55:49 <Camail> so far my favorite strategy is waiting for people to over extend and use their energy for engines or weapons, then burst them down from afar
19:55:59 <Camail> everyone sucks at energy management atm
20:09:39 <Camail> also after playing it there are multiple real time skill-based mechanics because the projectiles are quite slow which makes aiming and dodging bullets a thing
20:09:56 <Camail> so its not gonna be just a strategy game
