15:09:26 <ZK> nothin better than drinkin to kick your problems away!
15:09:54 <Dot`> nah, far cheaper to internalise them and let them give you disorders that way
15:10:35 <Runbunny> pfff
15:10:53 <Runbunny> I am not bothered by such petty things as problems, hopes and dreams.
15:14:57 <Runbunny> I should practice my throwing skills.
15:15:34 <Dot`> darts and drinking
15:16:22 <Runbunny> More like beer pong... This isn't England.
15:16:48 <Dot`> its also not america

15:29:06 <skram> of course you have a hello kitty belt
15:31:18 <Rawr|Fone> Is it swish anders
15:31:29 <Rawr|Fone> Because that is pretty great to have
15:35:43 <Runbunny> I don't think so.
15:36:38 <Runbunny> Well I didn't wear my belt for a long time.. but with these newish trousers, feels like they are falling down.. so I need my belt :/
15:41:06 <Rawr|Fone> Please anders

18:54:49 <skram> Dot`, do you think dub will grace us with his presence this weekend
18:56:01 <Bio> nah
18:56:05 <Bio> he hates us now
18:58:09 <Dot`> we can dream
18:58:35 <skram> I would be sad, but I have pizza to drown my emotions in
18:59:24 <skram> chilli peppers/bacon/salami/ground beef was a success Dot`
18:59:38 <skram> i only had red peppers and you said green so I could not use them, Dot`.
19:00:18 <reification> i had pizza yesterday, now i have no pizza. the tragedy of food
19:00:41 <skram> I am confident that you could acquire pizza right now if you wanted to, reif.
19:00:49 <Golly> i have two pizzas stored, they collect interest right?
19:01:25 <skram> Only if you have them in a high interest pizza account at your bank.
19:01:36 <Golly> dang it

19:22:11 <Phearlock> Hello little ponies
19:22:12 <Phearlock> big ponies
19:22:26 <Phearlock> and skram
19:22:28 <skram> hello ferlok
19:22:45 <skram> im not sure if you are being rude or not
19:22:55 <Phearlock> No you said a while ago
19:22:56 <Phearlock> you are not pon
19:23:02 <Phearlock> so you get your own category
19:23:07 <Phearlock> it's called skram
19:23:07 <skram> oh yeah
19:23:08 <Phearlock> and it is you
19:23:13 <skram> its MEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeee
19:23:43 <skram> I tried to find a song for you but I dont know what you like so im afraid you need to make your own kind of music
19:23:49 <skram> SIIIIIING YOUR OWN SPECIAL SOOOOOOOONG
19:23:56 <Phearlock> nice
19:24:33 <Phearlock> But yeah just random videogame music is nice, I like most rock and metal things, d&b kinda stuff or just really catchy instrumental things.
19:28:30 <Phearlock> https://magnalunaarts.tumblr.com/image/151131915208 I love ponies gesturing with their wings.
19:28:36 <Phearlock> so cute
19:35:27 <DoT|Phone1> Phear pon <3
19:35:45 <Phearlock> <3
19:45:49 <reification> hello phear
19:46:09 <Camail> dont ask skram for music suggestions, he hates good instruments
19:46:16 <Camail> because he hates beauty
19:49:50 <skram> true
19:49:57 <skram> this is my favorite instrument: https://youtu.be/MGOqIYo9cBE?t=72
19:52:04 <Camail> yet you dont like violins
19:52:04 <Camail> sigh
19:52:17 <Camail> not brooding enough?
19:52:26 <skram> i dont dislike violins
19:52:31 <Camail> you'd think something made with entrails would appeal you
19:52:32 <skram> i dislike violin solos
19:52:43 <DoT|Phone1> Skram. what else do you hate
19:52:46 <skram> i like fiddles and orchestral violin things
19:53:29 <skram> because a single violin usually sounds really screechy and unless thats the theme of the song it just sounds out of place
19:54:47 <skram> not as many things as camail thinks Dot`
19:55:02 <Camail> unlikely
