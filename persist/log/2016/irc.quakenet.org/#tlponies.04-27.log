00:00:20 <Camail> but yea I'm fine with this
00:00:46 <Camail> and I kinda doubt it will be unbalanced enough to warrant a change
00:02:03 <Camail> you can do both unbroken air and fire snake at the same time
00:02:06 <Camail> so thats a thing
00:02:21 <Dottt> pew pew pew
00:02:36 <Camail> so 15ft unarmed strikes that you can choose to make someone explode or get pushed tot he ground
00:02:37 <Camail> or both
00:02:42 <Camail> but that seems like a bit of a waste
00:02:53 <Dottt> if you dont like having ki

01:42:09 <ZK> i forget im there
01:47:50 <Camail> oh, turns out you can rearrange character sheets through folders
01:47:56 <Camail> I just wasnt clicking on the right part
01:47:56 <Camail> sigh
01:50:20 <Camail> .tell skram k i gave you a back up character sheet, its in the back ups folder, if you can see that
01:50:52 <Camail> .tell micen I move your horse to the NPCs folder
02:03:21 <ZK> wait, is skram actually going to die?
02:03:48 <Camail> no, but he wanted a character sheet just in case
02:03:55 <Camail> I can make one for you if you want
02:04:04 <ZK> nope
02:04:06 <ZK> im not dying
02:04:18 <ZK> if i do, my autistic ranger is comin back
02:04:21 <Camail> yea but you might leave the party
02:04:25 <Camail> which is functionally the same

02:40:51 <Camail> ZK  i can put a circle around your character with a black/green/whatever color border, any preference?
02:45:42 <ZK> purple?
02:47:09 <Camail> ok good
02:47:12 <Camail> cuz i guessed purple
02:47:28 <Camail> come into the game if you want to see it
02:57:31 <ZK> oooh ok its really tokens now
02:59:53 <Camail> ya
03:00:11 <Camail> I got paint.net which has more than 0 editting tools
03:00:28 <Camail> dont feel like bothering with all the stupid crack stuff for PS
03:02:16 <ZK> oh yea, i also did paint.net for my char
03:02:39 <ZK> Dottt is blackish?
03:04:43 <Camail> its just black
03:05:07 <Camail> his was just to make it look less bad with big white spaces
03:05:13 <Camail> but then i remade all of them
03:05:13 <ZK> oh ok
03:05:29 <Camail> if he wants me to change it then I will
03:05:43 <Camail> .tell dot` go in game and look at ur token, if you want the border changed tell me
03:11:46 <Camail> if no one realizes the thing i fixed by the end of the dungeon it will be interesting
03:12:23 <Camail> its pretty subtle but it took like 40 minutes because it was essentially me pushing a square peg in a round hole
03:12:43 <Camail> and in the end just taking a knife to the peg and carving out its vital organs
03:12:51 <Camail> because fuck that peg, why is it even square
03:26:52 <ZK> o.O
03:33:35 <Camail> also i just realized that kyza is going to take the dagger and never use it
03:33:43 <Camail> which is hilarious to me
03:33:57 <Camail> because the first magic weapon is just gonna be sitting there doing nothing
03:34:25 <ZK> how am i going to take dagger? Mynu is the one that has it for now?
03:34:31 <Camail> well yea
03:34:34 <Camail> but eventually you'll have it
03:34:41 <ZK> I was looking at dual wielding, so I might do that with the daggers
03:35:25 <Camail> but then you'd have to start carrying components around
03:35:27 <Camail> so inconvenient
03:37:08 <ZK> i can put my staff back in my back and pull out daggers. Although in combat i would just drop it and pick it back up later
03:38:57 <Camail> yea but then if you dont carry components you'd have to run to get your staff every time you cast a spell
03:39:00 <Camail> that seems even worse
03:39:15 <Camail> also this is a thing:
03:39:16 <Camail> ((@{level} + 1) / 6 + 0.5)d8
03:39:29 <Camail> replace the d8 with any dice and it auto calculates damage of spells based on level
03:39:37 <Camail> like the spells that you get one more dice at 5/11/17
03:40:35 <Camail> which means that in any given field you can pull any number from your character sheet if you do @{attribute}
03:40:37 <Camail> which is cool
03:40:52 <Camail> but we dont really have much use for that

12:02:16 <Micen> Cold and snow are the best!
12:02:46 <DoT`> anythign below 20 is cold for me, so summer might be cold too form my perspective

12:04:46 <Micen> .tell Phearlaptop that was a cute story.
12:05:10 <DoT`> so micen when you say you love the cold, you mean it being cold outside while you sit with heating?
12:06:17 <Micen> for being inside, thats my normal temprature, but i am fine going out in shorts and a tank top in what would be 10c
12:06:47 <Micen> shorts until water starts to freeze really.

15:58:14 <Camail> er, your new character is 1 level below everyone else*
15:58:42 <Camail> if we ever have multiple deaths then it might get more complicated

19:02:21 <carcinisation> well i saw it from this russian parking video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKj3SlmcIOk
19:02:39 <Camail> I have a deep distaste for people on amalgamation websites

19:42:57 <DoT`> lol
19:45:26 <DoT`> haha cam
19:45:29 <Camail> :P
19:45:30 <DoT`> that timing
19:45:41 <DoT`> i was just trying to fix the static on my mic
19:45:54 <Camail> fantastic
19:45:57 <DoT`> and just after i clicked "listen to device" on my pc
19:46:03 <Camail> LOL
19:46:25 <Camail> I guess God does have a plan for us all.
19:46:33 <DoT`> haha
19:48:14 <Camail> so on a scale of 1 to 10 tho
19:48:19 <Camail> how weird was that
19:49:06 <DoT`> i was very confused
19:49:30 <DoT`> "this fuzz is very weird on my mic"
19:49:37 <Camail> then the creaks started
19:49:41 <DoT`> turn off listen to mic
19:49:44 <DoT`> still there....
19:49:48 <Camail> LOOOOOOOOL
19:50:09 <Camail> I'm so happy right now
19:50:16 <Camail> I thought it would get old
19:50:22 <Camail> but it hasn't, and I don't think it will
19:50:31 <DoT`> well with that timing
19:50:35 <Camail> ikr
19:50:51 <Camail> might keep a list of tracks to play to make people rmeember the tab is open
19:50:55 <Camail> sometimes i need to room to be clear
19:51:14 <Camail> various smoke weed errdays and airhorns
19:51:40 <DoT`> i had the tab open form this morning, when i saw your tell
19:51:46 <Camail> ya
19:51:52 <Camail> i figured that was why
19:51:58 <Camail> idc right now
19:52:19 <Camail> but if I'm ever creating a custom character sheet sometimes I'll click the rolls to see how they work, or accidently click them
19:52:30 <Camail> its a bit annoying that the chat log is permanent, have to keep deleting it
19:52:51 <DoT`> and you cant trasfer sheets correct?
19:53:03 <ZK> why do you need to delete chat logs?
19:53:04 <DoT`> so no second game you can make for testing/creating
19:53:13 <DoT`> <Camail> but if I'm ever creating a custom character sheet sometimes I'll click the rolls to see how they work, or accidently click them
19:53:50 <Camail> I think you can import sheets but thats even more work than just wiping chat logs
19:54:44 <Camail> and chat logs aren't really important because we don't use it for anything but rolls
19:58:57 <Camail> and skram butt talk
19:59:03 <Camail> but that can come back at anytime
19:59:06 <Camail> when you least expect it
20:06:03 <Camail> oh DoT`  i forgot, did you ever pay for the resources to make the healing potion
20:06:17 <DoT`> no im poor!
20:06:19 <DoT`> what you need?
20:06:20 <Camail> then...
20:06:23 <Camail> you cant make one
20:06:27 <Camail> 25g of stuff
20:06:32 <Camail> its half the price of the item
20:06:47 <DoT`> im going to start demanding money form ppl
20:07:00 <Camail> just take 25g out of your pocket, you've gotten enough from the first session so its probably fine
20:07:07 <DoT`> k
20:07:16 <Camail> also you guys can create a party fund once you care more
20:07:27 <DoT`> so every day i can just make a roll to see how my progress goes?
20:07:27 <Camail> well
20:07:33 <Camail> once your characters care more aobut each other*
20:07:39 <DoT`> lol
20:07:47 <Camail> it takes 2 days for a common healing potion
20:07:58 <Camail> you dont NEED to make a roll for that to happen
20:08:05 <Camail> I am making you roll to see if you can do it faster
20:08:16 <Camail> you rolled high and did an entire days work in like 1 hour
20:08:25 <Camail> tomorrow it'll just be done
20:08:44 <Camail> going on maybe I'll make it easier, maybe make it possible to make in one day
20:08:45 <Camail> we'll see
20:09:03 <Camail> Probably make a day 1 creation a DC15
20:09:07 <DoT`> i rolled 18!
20:09:22 <Camail> " going on maybe I'll make it easier"
20:09:23 <Camail> ^
20:09:32 <DoT`> ah
20:09:59 <Camail> retconning because of forgotten mechanics is not the same as changing a mechanic mid game, so no retcon for that (if the change even happens)
20:10:37 <Camail> it might or might not, i don't know how fast pace we'll be going
20:10:45 <Camail> god knows you guys have been cramming in as much per day as possible
20:11:01 <DoT`> as much drama as possible >.>
20:11:07 <Camail> two and a half days have passed, i think
20:12:27 <Camail> tomorrow will be fun tho
20:12:45 <DoT`> hopefully
20:13:27 <Camail> I think I've found a good way to set up dungeons, now I just need to learn more about worldbuilding
20:13:34 <Camail> but every session will hopefully be better than the last
20:14:09 <Camail> and by learn more aobut world building i mean taking real, properly structured notes that I can easily access and give proper information
20:14:31 <Camail> becaues everything is a chaotic messsssss
20:14:43 <Camail> need to use bullet points and shit
20:20:45 <DoT`> \o/
20:26:53 <ZK> I cant wait for level 3. Dunno how I'll go about roleplaying getting my pseudodragon familiar
20:27:36 <DoT`> probably argue with it
20:27:41 <DoT`> try not to step on it though
20:28:59 <ZK> i mean, he basically responds to my thoughts
20:29:23 <ZK> I think I'll retcon my story to have been with him in the woods a while back, and at level 3 a link is formed
20:30:07 <Camail> we can work out something a bit more elegant
20:31:20 <Camail> also http://i.imgur.com/dc1NjI4.png
20:31:36 <Camail> just a an xp thing if ya care
20:37:04 <skram> leave my butt alone pls
20:37:28 <skram> its seen too much abuse at your hands
20:37:30 <skram> wink wink, bitch
20:40:49 <Camail> DoT`  I've spent so much time looking at monk that now I really really want to play one and look like Gouken
20:41:07 <Camail> open palm technique and just be the baddest of asses

22:42:58 <DuB`> Every day.
22:43:48 <Dot_> poor pon
22:43:59 <Dot_> this Dreadnaught game looks pretty cool
22:44:04 <Dot_> pew eow space ships
22:44:24 <Dot_> pew pew*
22:46:35 <Phearlaptop> Looks a lot like Mechwarrior online with big spaceships
22:47:36 <Phearlaptop> Looking at the gameplay I don't really see a reason to play this over that.
22:47:53 <Phearlaptop> This looks a bit more ability focused
22:48:36 <Dot_> flashy space ships phear!
22:48:37 <Camail> i tihnk the big appeal is pew pew
22:48:42 <Camail> pew pew fwooooosh
22:48:44 <Camail> ratatatatata
22:49:09 <Camail> which, from your perspective, is probably incredibly shallow
22:49:19 <Camail> but its big and shiny and its space ships
22:49:37 <Camail> since the beginning of time people have wanted a pirate ship pvp game
22:49:48 <Camail> everyone loves ship based combat, this is basically the same thing
22:50:04 <Phearlaptop> It looks alright for sure.
22:50:12 <Camail> pew pew
22:50:17 <Dot_> PEW PEW
22:50:24 <Camail> settle down dot
22:50:32 <Dot_> no, we have DnD tomrow
22:50:46 <Camail> ur a monk
22:50:50 <Camail> they are very centered
22:50:52 <Dot_> pew pew
22:52:07 <Camail> Dot_  for real tho i think we should just have a 1 on 1 conversation sometime to really get a grasp on where you want to take your character in terms of personality, maybe look through the ideals/traits/flaws stuff, get something to draw from
22:52:18 <Camail> its SO much easier to play this game if you have resources to rely on
22:53:03 <Camail> and I want everyone to feel comfortable playing
22:53:04 <Phearlaptop> Yeah, I think it'd be fun, might play some if anyone I know are playing it and it's f2p
22:53:24 <Camail> is it f2p? I'd bandwagon the shit out of it
22:53:33 <Phearlaptop> I have no idea if it is or not
22:53:50 <Camail> I'd rather it be a pirate ship game but I'll take the extra dimension
22:54:49 <ZK> Dot's personality is getting annoyed at kyra's and mynu's shenanigans
22:55:02 <Dot_> its a full time job
22:55:46 <Phearlaptop> Ok can confirm this will be a f2p game
22:55:48 <DuB`> Spesships?
22:55:50 <DuB`> :D
22:55:50 <Camail> nice
22:55:52 <Camail> dub shut up
22:55:56 <DuB`> D:
22:56:06 <Phearlaptop> Probably easier to get into than MWO
22:56:23 <Phearlaptop> So I won't feel as bad once I'm done playing it =P
22:56:59 <Dot_> f2p really? thast cool
22:58:59 <Phearlaptop> I mean chances are it'll be a thing to play once overwatch gets a bit boring, then some update will be released and everyone will go back to that.

23:55:52 <Bio> idk though, our third and fourth lines have been really good
23:55:57 <Bio> especially vs the hawks
23:56:11 <ZK> true
23:56:18 <Bio> steen is really good vs top line guys
23:56:42 <Bio> theres a rumor that tara is nursing some sort of injury
