01:38:44 <Dot`> http://loceri.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Sugar-Games-302430026
01:38:55 <Dot`> i miss loceri art
01:39:21 <Camail> why are people commenting on that still
01:39:47 <Dot`> it was posted to the reddit, at least thast where i saw it
01:40:36 <Camail> oh god, how awful was brony reddit back in 2011-2013
01:40:43 <Camail> i can only imagine
01:41:08 <Dot`> probably as obnoxious as everywhere else?
01:41:10 <Dot`> lol
01:41:16 <Camail> but with a victim complex
01:41:56 <Camail> ponies were great in isolated pockets of people who knew each other
01:42:04 <Camail> like this one
01:42:35 <Dot`> like any large group i think cam, they suck as the loud annoying ones are heard
01:42:39 <Bio> with interests that weren't just horses
01:43:13 <Camail> its not just any big group, though, its like any big group that is persecuted
01:43:32 <Camail> there was a large number of people who liked being victims or were overly defensive
01:44:04 <Camail> which means that reddit was probably filled with a bunch of stuff that was prophecy fulfilling awkwardness
01:44:09 <Camail> like r atheism
01:44:47 <skram> r/atheism is a parody of itself
01:45:15 <Camail> only because of how utterly shit it was and continues to be
01:46:07 <Camail> both atheism and ponies are counterculture, and have parallel sects that thrive on being victims of the reaction to counter culture
01:46:21 <Camail> obviously to different degrees because one is a show the other is a beliefe system
01:47:01 <Camail> most people who like ponies are fine though, the victims moved onto someone else to be offended by
01:47:58 <Bio> i luv being offended

20:11:29 <ZK> thats so cs go
20:21:44 <reification> for some reason playing sym on hollywood defence is incredibly unpopular with my teams recently
20:21:52 <reification> like worse than say attack bastion
20:22:25 <reification> at least until it works great
20:23:41 <reification> it is funny to see ppls changed minds tho
20:24:02 <reification> i guess most sym pickers are trolling
20:24:23 <reification> and some ppl don’t appreciate situationality
20:27:01 <Camail> first point she is "ok" and then she is immediately shit
20:27:08 <Camail> and she is only good if you can hold the first push
20:28:02 <Camail> then you just have people who hate seeing any char thats not really good
20:28:16 <Camail> you just dont play enough bastion to see the hate for him
