02:24:09 <Camail> house of cards is really good, guys
02:24:12 <Camail> obv no spoilers
02:24:21 <Camail> but this season is much better than season 3
02:24:27 <DoT`> It is, crsium recomended it a few months back
02:24:33 <DoT`> oh new season?
02:24:38 <Camail> yea s4 is out
02:24:39 <Camail> completely
02:24:49 <Camail> I've watched 3 eps so far
02:25:21 <DoT`> did they just realse them all at once?
02:25:27 <DoT`> I am sure i checked a few days ago 
02:25:35 <Camail> I'm not a fan of certain things stardew does, all of these 2-heart cutscenes so far have been pretty meh
02:25:41 <Camail> yea dot, last week 
02:25:47 <DoT`> cool
02:27:53 <Camail> ugh, you have to choose between two opposing sides or be neutral, there isn't any negotiated option or any subtlety to some of them
02:28:15 <DoT`> some of the cutscenes i have seen are nice, but mostly they are just a break and all together they build the town nicly
02:29:42 <Camail> yea i like the idea i just don't like the execution
02:29:52 <Camail> well
02:29:58 <Camail> only the ones with multiple npc's
02:30:06 <Camail> anytime its with just a single one its fine
02:30:21 <DoT`> the black and white choices i have normaly end with the one you disagree with going "i suppose your right" pretty much
02:30:23 <Camail> but the confrontational scenes dont have any satisfying options
02:30:27 <DoT`> casual game woohoo!
02:30:30 <Camail> not haley
02:30:32 <Camail> the bitch
02:30:37 <DoT`> oh, she hates me
02:30:40 <DoT`> haha
02:30:50 <Camail> ironically she is the highest romance character for me
02:30:53 <Camail> because spring birthday
02:31:40 <Camail> rip getting married year 1 tho
02:31:52 <Camail> i liked getting that out of the way in harvest moon
02:32:00 <Camail> I don't dilly dally when courting
02:32:35 <Camail> lmao
02:32:36 <Camail> alt tabbed
02:32:38 <Camail> clicked back in
02:32:43 <Camail> it selected the current option
02:32:49 <DoT`> it does that >.>

02:33:04 <DoT`> ive done it twice, happy ppl no more
02:33:14 <Camail> lul
02:33:21 <Camail> accidently reject marriage
02:33:24 <Camail> oops divorce
02:33:28 <DoT`> LOL
02:33:32 <skrma> wat game are you playing cam
02:33:36 <Camail> stardew valley
02:34:03 <DoT`> a named a goat skram
02:34:04 <DoT`> <3
02:34:29 <Camail> so far I like it a lot but its stresful because i am being nagged by harvest moons 'you only have 3 years to 100% this game' time pressures
02:34:33 <skrma> how romantic
02:34:40 <Camail> but I'm pretty sure you dont have the same pressures
02:34:56 <DoT`> does this game have a timelimit?
02:35:00 <Camail> i dont know
02:35:01 <Camail> i dont think so
02:35:10 <Camail> if you look at your grandpa's grave stone there is
02:35:11 <Camail> something?
02:35:14 <Camail> i dont know what it is
02:35:18 <DoT`> ok, i have seen that doorway in the corner of the farrm
02:35:21 <Camail> i made great pains to avoid spoilers ont he wiki
02:35:26 <DoT`> gravestone
02:35:28 <DoT`> not doorway
02:35:30 <Camail> (but still looking up gifts)
02:35:46 <Camail> i dont have time to figure out what they like on my own
02:36:04 <DoT`> i test a bit, but also look after a bit for gifts
02:36:05 <Camail> but if you give someone a perfect gift on their birthday you get like 4 hearts
02:36:10 <DoT`> i test with stuff i have a lot of
02:36:17 <Camail> thats bad tho
02:36:21 <Camail> because thats usually stuff they dont like
02:36:25 <Camail> which actively lowers it
02:36:29 <DoT`> flowers cam
02:36:33 <Camail> oh
02:36:44 <Camail> dont give people stones, they hate stones
02:36:48 <DoT`> the picked fruit only to linus
02:36:50 <DoT`> HAHA
02:36:50 <Camail> even though i worked super hard to break that big rock
02:37:05 <DoT`> no one appreciates hard work
02:37:05 <Camail> everyone hates stones
02:37:10 <Camail> especially haley
02:37:12 <Camail> fuck her
02:37:21 <DoT`> i gave someone duck maynasse and they got angry!
02:37:31 <Camail> .r haley fuck that bitch
02:37:34 <DoT`> you know how mutch thats worth you ungratful bastard
02:37:42 <Camail> some characters dont like mayo
02:37:48 <Camail> i think abi likes it?
02:37:54 <DoT`> abi likes clams
02:37:55 <DoT`> easy
02:38:01 <Camail> I'm split between going for abigail and nature lady
02:38:07 <DoT`> doesnt love them though
02:38:09 <Camail> because nature lady is easy to buy for
02:38:15 <DuB`> Farmgame?
02:38:21 <Camail> abby fucking LOVES the purple gem
02:38:25 <DoT`> yip
02:38:26 <Camail> SHUT UP NERD DUB
02:38:35 <DoT`> this is srs game dub
02:38:42 <DoT`> super srs casual 
02:38:46 <Camail> i cant wait to give gus a parsnip
02:38:48 <DuB`> Oh.
02:38:49 <DuB`> Kay.
02:38:51 <Camail> his birthday is next
02:38:58 <Camail> gonna be so hyped
02:39:10 <DoT`> i fail to find ppl on thier birthdays sometimes, then i am sad
02:39:19 <Camail> the wiki has their complete schedule
02:39:20 <DoT`> parsnip hype!
02:39:22 <Camail> its really useful
02:39:30 <Camail> because srsly missing birthdays like that just sucks
02:39:37 <Camail> and you CANT know where they will be
02:39:52 <Camail> it can change on a day to day season to season basis
02:39:53 <Camail> its stupid
02:40:00 <DoT`> i have a rough idea on thier locations they go to, but i still get days mixed up
02:40:09 <DoT`> tuesdays are super easy
02:40:16 <Camail> or once you are 2 heart you can just go to their homes int he morning
02:40:28 <Camail> everyone is at home from 8-9 i believe
02:41:35 <DoT`> i just got the horse, so much faster
02:41:56 <Camail> how old is abigail
02:42:04 <Camail> how old is the mc
02:42:10 <Camail> i feel like she's a teen still
02:42:17 <Camail> and its kinda awkward
02:42:18 <DoT`> i dont know, age is an obscure thing in this
02:42:24 <Camail> you know what? dont answer that
02:42:28 <Camail> i dont want to know
02:42:34 <DoT`> its better this way
02:42:35 <Camail> if worse comes to worse, ignorance is key
02:42:46 <Camail> she keeps saying she has homework
02:42:54 <Camail> even though there is explicitly no schooling system
02:42:56 <DoT`> dub says he has homework
02:43:01 <Camail> and dub is 12
02:43:02 <Camail> OH FUCK
02:43:04 <Camail> ABIGAIL IS 12

02:48:45 <Camail> penny AND her mother
02:48:46 <Camail> hot
02:49:01 <Camail> i wonder if you can give linus a handy behind his tent
02:50:03 <DoT`> there is no way to get behind his tent, limiting game
02:50:34 <Camail> I'm down to lvl 50 in the mines and i think i might be getting too far for my first spring
02:50:39 <Camail> its getting rough
02:51:02 <Camail> also FUCK FUCK FUCK these fishing quests
02:51:10 <Camail> getting 3 of any single fish is such a fucking pain
02:51:26 <DoT`> the mines you just need to get a lucky weapon drop then eat some good food
02:51:29 <Camail> I CANT CATCH ANY SARDINES THE ANCHOVIES ARE CURRENTLY GROUP FUCKING MY FISHING POLE
02:51:51 <Camail> i got a club that does 9-15 damage
02:51:54 <Camail> which is nice
02:51:58 <Camail> but its so time consuming now
02:52:06 <DoT`> winter is best for the mines
02:52:07 <Camail> so many things to do
02:52:09 <Camail> friends to bribe
02:52:17 <Camail> i dont want to get animals
02:52:21 <Camail> i dont trust myself with a life
02:52:38 <DoT`> i waited till winter to build my first coop
02:52:52 <Camail> you dont even have money to do it before that
02:52:56 <Camail> you can rush it but why
02:53:01 <Camail> unless its a huge money maker
02:53:14 <DoT`> i just want a ducks feather and a rabbits foot!!!!
02:53:20 <DoT`> damn they never drop
02:53:34 <Camail> stop killing runbunny
02:53:36 <DoT`> they are a steady money maker
02:53:46 <Camail> rabbits feet are also a universally loved gift
02:54:04 <DoT`> jellies and drink is hwere the money is at!
02:54:11 <DoT`> i just need charcoal....
02:54:20 <DoT`> that stuff is more rare than gold
02:55:00 <Camail> early int he mines it isnt, dunno about alter
02:55:08 <Camail> you can find minecarts with it
02:55:09 <Camail> which is nice
02:55:14 <DoT`> hmm, i should run through early mines 
02:55:16 <Camail> also just make a treefarm
02:55:24 <Camail> and convert wood to charcoal
02:55:32 <DoT`> the minecarts are a set thing and dont respawn coal
02:55:39 <DoT`> 20 wood a shot
02:55:40 <Camail> hey dot did you find yourself leveling everything evenly?
02:55:56 <Camail> because everything is the same level for me
02:55:59 <DoT`> nah, fishing fell behind
02:56:04 <DoT`> comabt and mining where slow
02:56:06 <Camail> and i never made an effort to make sure that happened
02:56:17 <DoT`> foraging was quick at first but has slowed down
02:56:18 <Camail> everything is lvl 4 for me, with fishing at 5
02:56:46 <Camail> fishing can be really luctrative , i think
02:56:52 <Camail> but it requires a lot of time
02:57:16 <Camail> the farther into the water you are the bestter the fish
02:57:30 <DoT`> i wona hook that doesnt attract high lvl fish but the bar sticks to fish
02:57:34 <Camail> i am catching gold star fish off the lagoon
02:57:40 <DoT`> and you just have to click to cast and catch, then wait

03:30:13 <DoT`> these magical foot dropping rabbits 
03:30:43 <DoT`> at this point i dont mind paying 8k if you just let me kill it and get 4 feet
03:33:28 <Camail> i was about to say i ahte how upgrading equipment takes it from you for a few days
03:33:38 <Camail> but thne i realized its a mechanic that forced players to do everything
03:33:49 <Camail> so nvm, actually love it
03:35:16 <Camail> i want to cuckold demetrius, would make this game 10/10
03:35:34 <Camail> i guess its the fact that romance options are explicitly single
03:35:46 <motbob> ya it's frustrating
03:35:46 <Camail> and my rebellious nature
03:36:02 <motbob> that mom in the southwest's husband is gone
03:36:07 <Camail> and maybe dicking robin would make upgrades cheaper...
03:36:10 <motbob> she's raising the kids alone what a joke
03:36:13 <Camail> jodi
03:36:25 <motbob> you need a more reliable man in your life
03:36:28 <Camail> i think he's army, or something
03:36:44 <Camail> a man with parsnips
03:36:46 <Camail> parnips for days
03:37:49 <DoT`> you people have no faith in Kent!
03:38:13 <Camail> WTF
03:38:22 <Camail> you cant do anything with the blacksmith while he's upgrading your tool
03:38:27 <Camail> thats fucking annoying
03:38:30 <DoT`> yea, haha'
03:38:38 <Camail> cant he juggle my axe and my hoe
03:38:42 <Camail> what a shit
03:38:53 <DoT`> make sure you have all those geodes broken too
03:38:57 <Camail> i will bury him with geodes
03:39:03 <Camail> BURY HIM
03:39:07 <Camail> i ahvent mined in 2 days
03:39:10 <Camail> too busy gifting
03:39:15 <Camail> full time job
03:39:21 <DoT`> the worst is watering can upgrade
03:39:25 <Camail> 28 npcs, 56 gifts a week
03:39:32 <Camail> i need the watering upgrade
03:39:34 <Camail> so badly
03:39:35 <DoT`> either have to get lucky with a 2 day rain, or wait for winter
03:40:11 <Camail> or spend 100000000g on sprinklers
03:40:13 <Camail> that suck
03:40:28 <Camail> omg the wrost tho?
03:40:31 <Camail> 12 slot backpack
03:40:35 <DoT`> HAHA
03:40:36 <Camail> the woooorst
03:40:39 <Camail> got that upgrade asap
03:40:43 <DoT`> that upgrade is really needed
03:40:53 <Camail> mgiht as well be 6 slots
03:40:57 <Camail> cuz thats all i had free
03:41:46 <motbob> you have to like
03:41:53 <motbob> leave the watering can and hoe in the house
03:42:06 <DoT`> its not health that stops the mining then or energy, its space
03:42:48 <motbob> more than any other game, it's going to be really hard not to look at a guide
03:44:09 -!- DoT|Phone1 [~Dot@90.218.72.141] has joined #tlponies
03:45:16 <Camail> i left everything but the pcik and my sword when mining
03:45:20 <Camail> and some food sometimes
03:45:36 <DoT`> you gathering ALL that town gossip on what ppl like mot
03:45:37 <Camail> mot harvestmoon is exactly like this
03:45:49 <Camail> if you missed an event you either were done for or had to wait a year
03:45:53 <Camail> so lol if you didnt know about it
03:46:16 <Camail> there is no time to figure shit out YOU GOTTA GO FARM
03:46:18 <DoT`> at least ther is a calander, i got one for the house too
03:46:51 <Camail> omg, i was scared i forgot gus' birthday
03:46:53 <Camail> its tomorrow
03:46:56 <Camail> had a heart attack
03:47:13 <DoT`> that panic
03:47:19 <Camail> thats 640 friendship points! dot!
03:47:29 <Camail> its important!
03:47:32 <DoT`> huzzah!
03:47:49 <DoT|Phone1> I should start handing out parsnips
03:48:05 <DoT`> in real life
03:52:02 <DoT`> sleeeep
03:53:16 <Camail> fuck this fucking rare fish
03:53:18 <Camail> holy shit
03:53:31 <Camail> it keeps biting, and its impossible to catch at my level
03:53:53 <DoT`> eat some fisherman food
03:57:20 <Camail> but that costs money
03:57:24 <Camail> and I am so very poor
03:57:38 <Camail> I'm nowhere close, the +1 wouldnt help
03:58:01 <motbob> fishing's hard
03:58:40 <DoT`> give wally gifts, im sure he will give fish related stuff
03:59:33 <Camail> I'm gonna have to get the thrid pole before getting the legendary fish
04:00:50 <motbob> does fishing get easier with better poles
04:01:35 <motbob> i never really had a problem except when i ran into the impossible fish once
04:02:05 <motbob> apparently a lot of people find fishing hard but i played years of Helicopter Game so i'm a pro
04:03:02 <motbob> i wish there were a Better Writing mod
04:04:38 <Camail> well they dont make it easier directly but i dunno how many kinds of tackle there are
04:04:44 <Camail> or what they do
04:04:55 <Camail> fishing is easy up until the legendary fish
04:05:10 <Camail> well, the super cucumber gave me trouble but i never failed on them
04:11:09 <Camail> i think I'll upgrade my watering can inbetween summer and fall
04:11:17 <Camail> then upgrade agian in winter
04:11:26 <Camail> seems like the best option
04:11:48 <Camail> then stock up on tuna and explore the mines until i die a painful death
04:13:06 <Camail> oh wait, gus wants a dimaond, not a aprsnip
04:13:08 <Camail> lol fuck him
04:13:12 <Camail> not even gonna save scum this
04:13:21 <Camail> saving that diamond for people i give a shit about
04:14:30 <Camail> DoT`  i like when you give abi rocks and she says 'how did you know i was hungry'
04:14:37 <Camail> like wtf, bitch eats rocks apparently
04:14:43 <Camail> gems*
04:15:01 <DoT`> she also dont want your rocks
04:15:44 <Camail> she wants quartz i know that
04:15:47 <DoT`> there are a number of bugs around
04:15:49 <Camail> nice cheap gift
04:15:58 <DoT`> amythest
04:16:05 <DoT`> and clams
04:16:22 <DoT`> clams is only a like, but easy to get
04:16:50 <Camail> i bet u like her clam
04:18:56 <Camail> I'm super tempted to look up the gravestone to see wtf it is
04:18:59 <Camail> but i dont want to
04:19:01 <Camail> its a struggle
04:19:07 <Camail> the gravestone in town, btw
04:20:04 <DoT`> leah says this line "If you hear banging coming from my workshop, its probably me working on something"
04:20:51 <Camail> coal from fishing
04:20:53 <Camail> yay fishing!

13:58:48 <Dot_> the smug ppl who have played it and know everything because they read it up
13:59:00 <Dot_> then act like your an idiot because you are lost on your first playthrough
13:59:12 <Dot_> i hate ppl
14:06:48 <Rawr|Fone> Fix your name dot
14:11:41 <Runbunny> Yeah dot.
14:11:43 <Runbunny> You better.
14:12:05 <Runbunny> O:
14:12:14 <Runbunny> Are you refering to me Dot?
14:12:22 <Dot_> everyone!
14:13:36 <Runbunny> I just don't want to give you the answer O:
14:13:42 <Runbunny> So I am being koi and coy about it.
14:13:49 <Dot_> its not that kind of thing angel
14:14:58 <Dot_> its more i dont know, when people will say "well you should have gone thorugh this secret area, skipped this area, killed this boos thats far above your level, then that parts simple, why are you struggling?"
14:15:22 <Dot_> might be an exageration that, but its the kinda thing i keep seeing
14:16:08 <Runbunny> That the glory of dark souls.
14:16:37 <Runbunny> You don't get anything. Nobody tells you anything. So you stumble around trying to make sense of it all. 
14:16:44 <Dot_> the issue os how smug ppl are, its like book elitsm over movies kind of annoying
14:17:54 <Dot_> i ran thorugh the first part of the game agian, till the taurus deamon where i died becuase controls messed up, and the repaly is so much simpler on its own
14:18:09 <Dot_> even without watching streams or looking up strats
14:18:22 <Dot_> just knowing fireplaces and stuff makes it so much simpler
14:19:04 <Dot_> thats why the smugness of ppl annoys me, its so unfounded
14:19:06 <Runbunny> yeah.
14:19:16 <Runbunny> It's an trial and error game.
14:19:43 <Runbunny> Don't fret over if you missed an area or an item the first time you play the game.
14:19:49 <Runbunny> It's about exploration as well.

18:09:13 * DoT` hugs skram
18:09:19 <DoT`> jonas hedge, whats wrong?
18:09:31 * Bio licks skram
18:10:02 <skram> I think I vastly overestimated my fitness levelz and now my things hurt
18:11:11 <CockRoach|42> :)
18:11:20 <DoT`> that is good
18:13:51 <skram> the instructor lady gave me a thumbs up
18:14:03 <skram> i feel oddly motivated to be hurt again on monday
18:14:03 <CockRoach|42> spoiler: they always do
18:14:31 <skram> and i thought she was flirting with me
18:14:36 <skram> dream status: crushed
18:18:20 <DoT`> Runbunny, i really am not enjoying having to get past those stupid spinning wheel skeltons every time.....
18:20:57 <Runbunny> Yeah it'll get better once you find the bonfire.
18:21:16 <Runbunny> there's a ladder near a human looking undead. 
18:21:22 <Runbunny> in the tomb of giants.
18:21:49 <DoT`> im really bored of either taking a huge time to lure and fight each wheel, or die to them when the camra swaps around
18:22:05 <Runbunny> Wheel skeletons are like the strongest skeletons in the game. nearly.
18:22:37 <Runbunny> You want me to show you where that particular bonfire is?
18:22:52 <DoT`> im just dying trying to get there now
18:23:04 <DoT`> and have yet to pass the three giants that sit together
18:23:22 <Runbunny> They don't sit together O:
18:23:38 <DoT`> well i got there twice and both times 3 have jumped me
18:32:56 <Runbunny> Do you go in like a tomb thingy like the one where you fought pinwheel?
18:33:28 <DoT`> yea
18:34:54 <Runbunny> There is like 6 big skeletons down there. I wouldn't recommend that place.
18:35:33 <Runbunny> Follow the wall and you'll find the bonfire down below next to a ladder.
18:37:28 <DoT`> its the only way i can find
18:37:42 <DoT`> and im dead again
18:37:53 <DoT`> yay for another few hhours of trying to get back there
18:37:59 <DoT`> this is worse than any boss
18:38:11 <DoT`> its tedious and boring

20:27:40 <Camail> naaaaah
20:27:41 <DoT|Phone> camamail
20:31:16 <Camail> doot
20:31:18 <Camail> i got the bear
20:31:23 <Camail> i wish it was bigger
20:33:23 <DoT|Phone> lol
20:33:39 <DoT|Phone> everything fit in your small horse
20:33:42 <DoT|Phone> house
20:33:56 <Camail> lewd
20:34:24 <Camail> i moved a few things around to make space
20:34:30 <Camail> looks like storage room tetris
20:34:50 <DoT|Phone> I blame Skram
20:35:00 <Camail> also, with proper spacing i think slow weapons are by far the best
20:35:02 <DoT|Phone> you hoarder
20:35:19 <Camail> everytime i try and use a fast weapon its just less effective
20:35:32 <Camail> and more likely to get hit
20:35:33 <DoT|Phone> daggers suck
20:35:36 <Camail> they do
20:35:47 <Camail> omg dot my fishing is so far ahead of everything else
20:35:50 <Camail> i fish so much
20:36:03 <Camail> 5 for most of the toher stuff, 8 for fishing
20:36:12 <Camail> i caught a fish worth 3.5k
20:36:31 <Camail> pretty sure thats a one time thing tho
20:36:44 <Camail> crabpots still suck and I'm super fucking salty that i picked that perk
20:36:56 <Camail> i didnt realize how bad it would be
20:37:55 <Camail> also I think I'm going for leah, who i can be pretty confident isnt 12
20:38:02 <DoT|Phone> Haha. I picked the other option
20:38:10 <DoT|Phone> can't recall what it was though
20:38:14 <Camail> meanwhile abijailbait will be a back up
20:38:23 <Camail> it was +% to fish profits
20:38:37 <DoT|Phone> and Haley ifs always there to hate
20:38:44 <DoT|Phone> is
20:38:55 <Camail> might get her to 10 hearts just to ruin her
20:39:19 <Camail> did you work on her at all?
20:39:29 <Camail> cuz she makes you open a fucking pickle jar
20:39:36 <Camail> bitch is basic
20:40:00 <DoT|Phone> she is a bitch! hatred everything I have her. worked on other ppl in the meantime
20:40:10 <DoT|Phone> Haha
20:43:19 <Camail> I liked abigails music scene tho
20:43:25 <Camail> probably my favorite track in the game
20:43:33 <Camail> maybe...without the mini harp
20:44:35 <Camail> oh also, you should kill the black things in the mines for coal, I am getting like 10 coal a trip fromt hat
20:45:15 <Camail> somewhere between 40 and 60 will get you a ton of those monsters
20:45:35 <DoT|Phone> I did start a new game today.  I messed up building placement to much. t
20:45:45 <DoT|Phone> so annoying
20:45:51 <Camail> did you not have enough room for something
20:46:31 <DoT|Phone> no. but you can't move them. and I placed the coop in a bad place. then the stable
20:46:53 <Camail> what constitutes a bad place
20:46:54 <DoT|Phone> the stable is really tall so bleh
20:46:57 <Camail> did you build them upside down?
20:47:04 <Camail> spent to much time in australia
20:47:42 <DoT|Phone> coop and barn are far apart. meaning a lot of running around every day
20:48:18 <Camail> ruined
20:48:31 <Camail> omg dot try and get haley high enough to dance at the festival
20:48:33 <DoT|Phone> add the stable blocking view. it became cramped with the coop
20:48:35 <Camail> i dunno if its possible
20:49:02 <Camail> so basically, just put them next to each other and relatively close to the house
20:49:45 <DoT|Phone> yea. with space for a fence so the animals don't wonder everywhere
20:50:39 <Camail> wow you slaver
20:50:45 <Camail> I'm gonna put a fence around ur house
20:50:48 <Camail> see how you feel
20:51:30 <DoT|Phone> comfort
20:53:00 <DoT|Phone> trees are nice one you can make jelly and wines
20:53:34 <DoT|Phone> all stuff should be made to jelly/pickled
20:54:05 <DoT|Phone> I'm not sure on how the maths works. our if it's set
20:54:11 <Camail> jelly takes too long for me right now, i don't feel like building enough preserves to make it relevant
20:54:24 <Camail> nor do i have the resources
20:54:47 <DoT|Phone> potato sells for 80. when pickled I got 315
20:54:51 <Camail> its easier to plant 50 plants than to make 20 preserves jars
20:55:04 <DoT|Phone> but that's where my coal went :(
20:55:21 <Camail> I might do that in the winter, tbh
20:55:36 <Camail> stock up on the most expensive fruit from fall
20:55:55 <DoT|Phone> that's when I started. ended up with about 18 preserves
20:56:19 <DoT|Phone> was not nearly enough to keep up
20:56:35 <Camail> yea
20:56:45 <Camail> seems like a side job until you scale up a ton
20:57:02 <Camail> you need to runt he early mines a lot to do that though
20:57:16 <Camail> which means no high level stuff
20:57:32 <DoT|Phone> I did forget the coal creatures
20:57:38 <DoT|Phone> they are nice
20:58:20 <Camail> the 40 wood to 1 coal is a brutal rate
20:58:37 <DoT|Phone> indeed
20:59:12 <Runbunny> I did it dot!
20:59:25 <Camail> lies
20:59:30 <Runbunny> I invaded some guy and took his stuff.
20:59:40 <DoT|Phone> evvviilll
20:59:56 <Runbunny> :D
21:00:31 <Camail> dot what did you tell leah to do
21:00:42 <Camail> etsy4lyfe?
21:00:43 <DoT|Phone> hold a art show
21:00:45 <Camail> good
21:00:50 <Camail> i agree
21:01:01 <Camail> i wonder what happens the oter way
21:01:14 <Camail> but this game is pretty anti-modern
21:01:27 <Camail> so it makes sense to make her geared towards the community
21:01:53 <DoT|Phone> yea. it's about rebuilding the town
21:02:05 <DoT|Phone> so attracting ppl sounds good
21:02:51 <Camail> fuck that morris guy
21:02:58 <Bio> the sounds in stardew are really nice
21:03:01 <Camail> might as well tie someone to a railroad
21:03:08 <DoT|Phone> bio has fallen?
21:03:17 <Bio> nah, watching dayj
21:03:22 <Camail> everything except the walking sounds
21:03:30 <Camail> those are annoying
21:03:35 <DoT|Phone> starcrack valley
21:04:55 <DoT|Phone> I'm bad at names cam. who is Morris
21:05:15 <DoT|Phone> the jojo guy?
21:05:16 <Camail> the joja fucker
21:05:33 <DoT|Phone> I well never give him money
21:05:38 <DoT|Phone> NEVER
21:05:58 <Camail> also dot i figure out that you need to get out of the mines at 12:40 to get back home safely without passing out
21:06:05 <Camail> yea also his stuff is more expensive
21:06:11 <Camail> so i dont even go to that store
21:06:40 <DoT|Phone> nice timing
21:06:56 <Camail> i hate going into the mines without getting through 5 levels
21:06:59 <Camail> feels like such a waste
21:07:43 <DoT|Phone> yup. the worst it's making it four then having no energy
21:09:15 <Camail> always bring a fish!
21:09:25 <DoT|Phone> lol. you and your fish
21:09:25 <Camail> a nice +63 energy
21:09:54 <DoT|Phone> I lacked pine cones oddly
21:09:57 <Camail> if id dint fish so much i wouldnt have made the best soup the governor ever tasted
21:10:03 <DoT|Phone> normally make the snacks
21:10:26 <Camail> I stopped making snack, gonna start a tree farm in the corner some time
21:10:45 <Camail> will probably be useful to have like 40+ seeds stocked just in case
21:11:00 <Camail> also, I am the king of backpacks
21:11:06 <DoT|Phone> have you cleared all your trees?
21:11:13 <Camail> people quake at my number of slots i weild
21:11:18 <Camail> no i havent, not even close
21:11:35 <Camail> but still, dont want to accidently use them all
21:11:59 <Bio> Twitch Plays: Naming Day9's  chicken
21:12:04 <Bio> Laqquitsaq
21:12:06 <DoT|Phone> by the time I got to the last quarter to fell trees they had become very thick
21:12:32 <Camail> i should do a mass clearing in the fall
21:12:36 <DoT|Phone> you can shake trees to get seeds
21:12:38 <Camail> i iamgine seeds dont drop int he winter
21:13:00 <Camail> if I'm gonna sit down and shake trees its gonna be with an axe
21:13:20 <DoT|Phone> it's not efficient but while walking around it's fine
21:13:25 <Bio> Laqquitsaqo
21:14:02 <DoT|Phone> get a horse cam
21:14:18 <DoT|Phone> 12 hardwood a day from the forest
21:14:21 <DoT|Phone> easy
21:14:50 <Camail> too many other things to do =/
21:15:16 <DoT|Phone> gotta power level those friendships
21:15:49 <Camail> I've decided to only rush like 8 of them, then to not look up anytihng about the others
21:15:54 <Camail> aka the ppl i dont care as much about
21:16:30 <DoT|Phone> just give Linus random fruit you picked
21:17:41 <Camail> ya i do
21:17:44 <Camail> he's so far away tho
21:17:51 <Camail> unless i go to the mines i dont usually see him
21:18:15 <Camail> mannn, now i fell bad for penny
21:18:25 <Camail> but i dont think sympathy marriage is a good thing
21:18:34 <DoT|Phone> I like penny
21:18:37 <Camail> so even tho her life is balls gonna have to pass
21:18:41 <DoT|Phone> poor her
21:18:59 <Camail> I have so much money now, cant i just give it to her
21:19:06 <DoT|Phone> lol
21:19:50 <DoT|Phone> you got the bus working?
21:19:56 <DoT|Phone> so much money
21:20:05 <Camail> no
21:20:09 <Camail> THATS just a money sink
21:20:35 <Camail> its like 42.5k?
21:20:41 <Camail> so much
21:21:05 <Camail> I'm spending that on getting better tools
21:21:05 <DoT|Phone> the 25 k reward is kinda nice but damn so much
21:22:48 <DoT|Phone> and the bus gives Pam a job!
21:24:01 <Camail> yea, spend nearly 50k so she can be a bus driver
21:24:02 <Camail> yay
21:24:21 <DoT|Phone> you asked to be able to give money
21:24:26 <DoT|Phone> don't be stingy
21:24:34 <Camail> thats not giving, thats hemorrhaging
21:25:38 <Camail> penny's dec description is so sad
21:25:51 <Camail> “Penny lives with her mom, Pam, in a little trailer by the river. While Pam is out carousing at the saloon, Penny quietly tends to her chores in the dim, stuffy room she is forced to call home. She is shy and modest, without any grand ambitions for life other than settling in and starting a family. She likes to cook (although her skills are questionable) and read books from the local library.”

23:13:09 <motbob> wtf
23:13:15 <motbob> do villager likes decay?
23:14:13 <DoT`> i tihnk they do
23:14:26 <DoT`> but i also think higher likes decay slower
23:21:01 <Camail> upgrading watering can at the end of summer
23:21:04 <Camail> WISH ME LUCK
23:21:13 <Camail> motbob  if you dont talk to them, yes
23:21:19 <Camail> a little bit everyday
23:21:48 <Rawr|Fone> Beeep beeeeeep
23:21:55 <Camail> DoT` thats not true, it might be harder to tell on your better friends though because hearts represent a vague number
23:21:56 <Rawr|Fone> 🐴🐴🐴🐴
23:22:06 <Camail> so lower people might JUST be at 1 heart
23:22:17 <Camail> but you might be like 50 points ahead on your 7th heart
23:22:33 <DoT`> ah
23:23:00 <DoT`> i had mayor at 10 for ages with just ognoring him but had someoen else decay a heart after like 3 days
23:23:02 <Camail> i can make sashimi now
23:23:04 <Camail> i aminvincible
23:23:18 <DoT`> you upgraded your house?
23:23:28 <Camail> yea if you maxed out lewis then it will take a very long time for that to happen
23:23:30 <Camail> probably 2 seasons
23:23:38 <Camail> because they would be a full heart
23:24:15 <Camail> but if the other person is only like 5-6 points into the next heart, they'll lose it if you dont tlak to them in 3 days
23:25:29 <DoT`> it makes sense if hearts are representative of a number
23:25:50 <DoT`> hmm, with first 2k, to get 2nd rod or backpack
23:25:53 <DoT`> the choices
23:27:46 <Bio> pony

23:53:49 <Yolteotl> and they want to nerf zerg on this MU
23:54:22 <DuB`> Mmmmm.
