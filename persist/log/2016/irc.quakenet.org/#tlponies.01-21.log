19:33:55 <Emily> which site you playing on?
19:34:36 <carcinisation> pokerstars - tcoop event 1 (final phase)
19:35:52 <carcinisation> AK vs TT made it :D:D:D:D
19:36:02 <Emily> ^_^
19:36:03 <Emily> nice
19:36:24 <Emily> one thing I like about poker is that you can actually watch some really good players stream on twitch
19:36:29 <Emily> so its kinda nice to follow them
19:36:59 <carcinisation> yes it's good like that
19:37:27 <carcinisation> i would have expected more secrecy
19:38:27 <Emily> they have like 5-7min delays
19:38:47 <Emily> but i guess for poker players a lot of the secrecy is lost because a lot of information is tracked by automated tools anyways
19:39:06 <carcinisation> it's more the thought process i was thinking of
19:45:17 <carcinisation> under 1k players left
19:48:17 <DoT|Phone1> yay
19:49:59 <carcinisation> i got moved to a table with the 6star player :/
19:50:51 <CockRoach|42> :o

19:53:23 <DoT|Phone1> Oh dear
19:54:02 <carcinisation> ran into QQ :(
19:54:21 <carcinisation> down to 100k
19:54:33 <CockRoach|42> :o
19:56:28 <carcinisation> oh the 6star made a dodgy shove got snaped off and lost almost all his stack :O
19:56:54 <CockRoach|42> time to win!
20:03:01 <Rawr|Phone> It's 5-5 right now dot
20:04:13 <Rawr|Phone> I think we will win 8-5 though
20:05:37 <carcinisation> you do that
