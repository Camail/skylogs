22:42:27 <Crisium> BW community already fragmented tho between Fish and iccup
22:42:49 <Rawr|Fone> Yeah I don't know how they will make it work
22:43:03 <Rawr|Fone> But if it does work out, it would be cool
22:43:32 <Crisium> ya, if its better than iccup its possible the west could switch, but western bw is so small
22:43:43 <Crisium> youd have to get the russians on board and thats not gonna happen cause iccup is their baby
22:43:47 <Crisium> but we shall see

23:06:41 <carcinisation> night pons
23:07:24 <Camail> rooooon, i finally passed https://osu.ppy.sh/s/29727
23:07:37 <Camail> my osu bucket list is almost complete
23:07:59 <Camail> all that's left is undefined future that i can recall
23:10:41 <Runbunny> The insane one?
23:10:47 <Runbunny> I thought you didn't play anymore O:
23:11:55 <Camail> i dont
23:11:58 <Camail> i just play every so often
23:12:58 <Camail> I'm not trying to FC anything , dont have the stamina to do that
23:13:17 <Runbunny> honestly I think that's more than me. I have become so bad that I shame myself.
23:14:13 <Camail> ever since i got the death adder osu has been easier
23:14:19 <Camail> I was essentially palying with weights on
23:14:38 <Camail> my old mouse was slow, broken, and had the non-friction pads worn off completely by the time i was done playing osu
23:14:46 <Camail> and my hardpad had worn through
23:15:04 <Camail> cloth pad + death adder makes me click and move faster so I'm nto as physically limited
23:15:13 <Camail> i can even do the undefined future death squares
23:15:19 <Camail> i choke immediately after but w/e
23:15:32 <Runbunny> I used to be able to feel irregularities on my mouse pad. 
23:17:20 <Camail> lmao and I just broke my combo record on ha tenya with a 360 and immediately failed
23:17:43 <Camail> hands still shaking from the previous adrenaline rush
23:17:59 <Camail> RIP my 80,000 rank tho
23:18:14 <Camail> got up to 10k and over the last 4 years its gone down to 80k
23:18:56 <Camail> biggest problem is that i still play maps where cookiezi is #1
23:18:59 <Camail> which shows my osu age >_>
23:19:17 <Runbunny> I need a new skin.
23:19:31 <Runbunny> They colors they use now are too bright and I can't see them well.
23:19:52 <Camail> though a lot of my oldest high scores are so irrelevant that my current average accuracy is 97.33% 
23:20:04 <Camail> even though it was like 92 last time i remember?
23:20:22 <Camail> roon i have my old skin still if you want it
23:20:31 <Camail> removes 300's,  is fairly visible
23:20:37 <Camail> are you colorblind i cant remember
23:20:43 <Camail> that was a thing for someone who played 
23:22:08 <Runbunny> Yes.
23:22:12 <Runbunny> I am colorblind.
23:22:24 <Runbunny> Green / Red is basically the same.
23:22:38 <Runbunny> the same goes for purple and grey.
23:23:17 <Camail> i also think i remember giving you my red/blue cursor and you didnt like it
23:23:27 <Camail> you'd probably be better off finding one you like
23:23:37 <skram> so if im green with envy at your extensive catgirl collection you might think im blushing, anders?
23:23:49 <Camail> or the other way around
23:23:58 <Camail> or both
23:24:15 <Runbunny> I tried a few. I even got like some shitty skin which adds stars all over the screen whenever you press anything.
23:24:21 <Runbunny> Yes Jonas.
23:24:23 <Camail> so if we mix red and green paint and paint our bodies with it are we invisible to you?
23:24:38 <Runbunny> Nah.
23:24:39 <skram> Yes that is how colorblindness works
23:25:15 <skram> If im wearing green clothes anders can see my underthings
23:25:17 <skram> or if im wearing green boxers he can totally stare at my dickles
23:25:35 <DoT`> s
23:25:37 <Camail> oh also awihle ago roon i beat glutamine's babylon
23:25:49 <Camail> which is by far my favorite song I've learned of from osu
23:26:10 <Runbunny> link me in game.
23:27:02 <Camail> the song?
23:27:06 <Runbunny> yeah
23:27:29 <Camail> how
23:27:52 <Camail> https://osu.ppy.sh/b/145118
23:27:55 <Camail> that is song
23:28:47 <Runbunny> there's a way to do it... but I actually don't know how :/
23:28:57 <Camail> lol
23:29:01 <Camail> might be for paid members
23:29:19 <Camail> osu!direct is a thing for $$
23:30:14 <Runbunny> I have played that map before but I don't have it downloaded.
23:30:16 <Runbunny> odd.
23:40:43 <Camail> I've rage deleted songs before
23:48:55 <Runbunny> maybe it was another song with the same background.
23:49:07 <Runbunny> or not. 
23:49:18 <Runbunny> anyhoo I need to sleep.
23:49:24 <DoT`> GNIGHT
23:49:26 <DoT`> dammit
23:49:31 <Camail> rip
23:49:33 <DoT`> dub please
