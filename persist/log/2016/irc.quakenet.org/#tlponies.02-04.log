00:53:27 <Cane> I wanted to ask you if you wanted to find a place for your spa in the new Minecraft world or if you just want to leave that up to me.
00:53:29 * BioSC hugs Cane
00:53:44 <BioSC> hi friend. how's life
00:54:23 <DuB`> I would have no idea, haven't hardly been IN the world. :O
00:54:48 <Cane> Bio: Blocky, but nicely shaded. I see Minecraft code in my sleep now.
00:54:52 <DuB`> Go ahead and do whatever with it - if I can find time soon to actually join in I'd probably just make a whole new thing anyway.
00:54:55 <Cane> But the server is back up and ready for 1.8.8
00:55:14 <Cane> DuB`, alrighty then, I'll leave it for now and come up with some suggestions if you come check out the server. =)
00:55:15 <Camail> is it microsoft branded?
00:55:22 <DoT`> its immpressive with apparently how bad 1.8 is to mod

09:53:18 <DoT`> mostly walking is playing another kings quest
09:53:45 <DoT`> though i didnt watch past ep 2 of siberia and non of the 3 ep for the game after
09:54:14 <DoT`> might just skip those and watch th Kings quest, they are always fun
10:18:20 <Saurabhinator> they dumped
10:18:26 <Saurabhinator> syberia
10:21:47 <DoT`> after so long? thats a lot of work to put in
10:22:14 <Saurabhinator> too much babbling
10:22:19 <Saurabhinator> and not enough progressing
10:22:23 <Saurabhinator> they got fed up with it
10:22:42 <DoT`> thats a shame, from the first week it looked interisting
10:23:02 <DoT`> and the game they played after only lasted 1 week
10:23:59 <DoT`> but lets be fair saura, those 3 are VERY bad at progression as a group, they never listen to talking then complain games make no sense
