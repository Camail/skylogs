12:35:42 <Runbunny> invisible bridges are fun eh?
12:35:58 <DoT`> got over those, they just take time
12:36:07 <DoT`> its the random leaps while runngn that kill me
12:36:27 <DoT`> then get to boss and clams followed
12:36:28 <Runbunny> How do you get a leap?
12:36:45 <DoT`> sometimes the controls decide to jump mid run
12:36:48 <DoT`> its amazing
12:37:00 <DoT`> and responsible for about half me deaths in this game
12:37:05 <Runbunny> maybe your space button is kinda broke :O
12:37:14 <DoT`> no other game has issues
12:37:28 <Runbunny> How many other games do you hold down space?
12:37:56 <DoT`> those clams would take 15+ minutes to kill and im not willing to go through that every time to try kill that boss
12:38:31 <Runbunny> well if you already been at the boss then there should be a fog gate. clams can't follow you through that.
12:38:59 <DoT`> there was no foggate the first time
12:39:08 <Runbunny> So you just run past all of them. If you have some int then you could get hidden body from Dusk which would make it all easier.
12:39:40 <Runbunny> yeah not the first time but if you triggered the cutscene then there should be one now.
12:41:13 <DoT`> you know what makes the invisible bridges easy, the idiots that have wwritten messages on them
12:42:32 <DoT`> intristing, i hit him a few times and he instantly regained the health
12:44:33 <Runbunny> yeah someone told you about Seath I believe.
12:44:55 <DoT`> oh dear, more dialouge i have missed?
12:45:16 <Runbunny> well maybe.
12:45:26 <Runbunny> I don't recall who tells you though.
12:47:53 <Runbunny> anyhoo if you remember the cutscene, seath came rushing into the cave after you went there.
12:48:32 <Runbunny> Now why would he rush there? Is there anything of importance in that cave? O:
12:54:07 <DoT`> welp cursed now
12:54:08 <DoT`> gg
12:54:14 <DoT`> no point going back there
12:54:43 <DoT`> does a nova while he blocks al ways away
12:59:19 <DoT`> so the way to remove a curse is the guy in the gargoyle tower
12:59:27 <DoT`> he is asking for 28000 souls
