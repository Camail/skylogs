01:06:27 <reification> good idea dub. i could add mint essence to my hot cocoa
01:07:09 <reification> but my protein powder is choc mint flavour so maybe i’ll wait

01:12:26 <reification> they also make best chocolate ice cream. i had some today

01:22:14 <Rawr|Fone> I wanna play more dota
01:22:25 <Rawr|Fone> But all my friends stopped playing
01:22:32 <Rawr|Fone> And I barely have any time
01:22:38 <DoT`> aww
01:23:18 <Rawr|Fone> I played three games today though!
01:25:01 <DoT`> need mroe for gm
01:26:12 <Rawr|Fone> I am still above 4k
01:26:43 <Rawr|Fone> I feel like it's easier to take long breaks from dota, compared to starcraft
01:27:16 <Rawr|Fone> If I stopped playing sc2 for 2 months, I'd lose 5 games in a row when I came back
01:27:42 <Rawr|Fone> But when I go back to dota after a break, I don't really have any problem
01:31:32 <Rawr|Fone> Dot dot
01:31:37 <Rawr|Fone> You should play dota
01:32:03 <DoT`> i am too bad
01:32:30 <DuB`> Dotes!
01:32:34 <DuB`> It's been... a while.
01:34:39 <Rawr|Fone> It's a fun game

15:54:09 <Dot_> BIO
15:54:12 <Dot_> hey dubs
15:54:19 <Dot_> i was finshing dead space 2 bio
15:54:25 <DuB`> :O
15:54:27 <DuB`> Scawy.
15:54:38 <Dot_> that last parts a bastard
15:54:39 <DuB`> Dot I woke up from the greatest overwatch dream just now.
15:54:44 <Phearlock> That was a fun game
15:54:45 <DuB`> I'm very good at that game, it seems.
15:55:10 <Dot_> i never got to finsh it before phear, so did now
15:55:18 <Phearlock> yay
15:55:45 <Dot_> im not sure how i feel about the unlockable difficulty, i never really replay games
15:56:04 <Dot_> all this stuff i now unlocked and will never see probably
15:56:20 <Phearlock> Yeah I didn't replay it either
15:56:23 <Phearlock> was fun though
15:56:31 <Dot_> its a good game
15:56:40 <Dot_> now to install 3 i suppose
15:56:48 <Dot_> i only have a cracked copy of that one though :/
15:56:50 <Phearlock> 3 was fun, not as scary
15:57:03 <Phearlock> Tbh none of them were scary
15:57:08 <Phearlock> They were fun though
15:57:26 <Phearlock> I think the only scary bit for me was when was backtracking through an area in 1.
15:57:32 <Phearlock> And kept expecting monsters.
15:57:46 <Phearlock> But no, just quiet and noises of machines running.
15:57:49 <Dot_> haha, that was a nice part, reminding you about all the times they traumitised you in number 1
15:58:05 <skrma> Is that a DuB` I see?
15:58:13 <skrma> YO DUB WHERE YO AT
15:58:14 <Dot_> i have moslty ended up playing at night with headphones on
15:58:23 <Phearlock> I get lonely and uncomfortable without monsters to shoot dot.
15:58:48 <Dot_> i liked the runnign around in a straight jacket
15:58:54 <Bio> pani
15:58:56 <Phearlock> heh
15:58:58 <Dot_> Bayu
15:58:59 <Phearlock> That bit was fun
15:59:46 <Phearlock> http://mistydash.deviantart.com/art/Holding-Dashie-586714512 have some reposty bio
15:59:49 <DuB`> SKARM.
16:00:02 <Phearlock> I want to grab cute pony
16:00:06 <Phearlock> for hugs.
16:00:15 <skrma> Hej dubles
16:00:22 <skrma> Did you buy a headphone amp yet
16:01:32 <DuB`> https://gfycat.com/SphericalAppropriateIcelandicsheepdog
16:01:39 <DuB`> Not yet, but I need to.
16:01:52 <Dot_> onlywatch
16:02:11 <DuB`> For some reason my PC can't output any volume at all. -.-;
16:02:21 <DuB`> At 100 on everything it's just kind of medium-low volume.
16:02:49 <Dot_> have you tried booting it
16:02:57 <DuB`> ??
16:03:05 <DuB`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUEQrLSf_O8
16:03:19 <skrma> well that happens if you have large drivers
16:03:26 <skrma> still, headphone amps are reasonably cheap
16:06:29 <DuB`> I don't know them at all...
16:06:35 <DuB`> Reccomendations?
16:06:38 <DuB`> Cheap as possible.
16:06:54 <DuB`> http://assets.amuniversal.com/df5ca730b17d01333cc4005056a9545d
16:07:34 <skrma> just get somethign that has t00bs on it
16:07:38 <skrma> it glows and looks neat
16:07:47 <DuB`> :D
16:08:07 <skrma> head-fi has a good guide somewhere

16:09:31 <skrma> I dont actually know how they work or if they even do anything worthwhile
16:10:07 <skrma> Since t00bs need high voltage and some current
16:10:50 <skrma> 12ax7s need like 300v
16:11:40 <DuB`> Not sure what that would mean. :O

19:56:15 <DuB`> Nah.
19:57:09 <DuB`> Lots of teams don't even run her because lucio's aoe heal does gets more done.
19:57:23 <DuB`> And his ult saves your whole team BEFORE they die.

19:58:08 <DoT|Phone> I want more mercy though
19:58:33 <DoT|Phone> I think mercy and bastion team is much better now

20:23:52 <Camail> this has nohing to do with connection
20:24:00 <Camail> first of all my problems are gone
20:24:17 <Camail> and second, its during loading into training room and going back to menus after a match or backing out of training room
20:24:21 <Crisium> i get long loading if i get disconnected
20:24:33 <Crisium> and sometimes long loading when i dont, so i think its the server
20:24:39 <Crisium> but usually its fine
20:24:50 <Camail> it happens when i play offline

23:31:12 <Crisium> Camail get ur silver
23:31:43 <Rawr|Fone> U are all sillypons
23:31:50 <Crisium> u is
23:31:52 <Camail> I haven't been able to play ranked since like 18 hours ago yo
23:32:01 <Camail> or any internet at all
23:32:10 <Crisium> buff internet
23:32:12 <Camail> i need to remember how to play actual humans
23:32:28 <Crisium> with chun, press buttons
23:33:20 <Camail> says the vega
23:33:27 <Camail> and the nash
23:33:33 <Camail> why not just play rashid wihle ur at it
23:33:58 <Rawr|Fone> Rashid is the best
23:34:54 <Crisium> na, i have no fear on my wakeup
23:34:59 <Crisium> at least one must respect ex sbk
23:35:37 <Crisium> there is no penalty to ever doing a meaty normal
23:35:39 <Crisium> it sucks
23:36:38 <Camail> !framedata
23:36:45 <Camail> ?framedata
23:37:25 <Camail> also you dont have to respect ex sbk
23:37:32 <Camail> if you hit her int he cooch
23:37:45 <Crisium> any limitation is a respect
23:38:18 <Camail> ummm no? if you solve an option you aren't respecting it you are playing around it
23:38:22 <Camail> you still get your desired result
23:38:28 <Camail> necalli can divekick it
23:39:16 <Crisium> plz
23:40:06 <Camail> it not worth talking to you
23:40:08 <Crisium> any and all meaties are viable at any and all times on vega, without restriction or fear of failure (unless you do an unsafe on block meaty, which is your problem)
23:40:14 <Crisium> my thoughts exactly
23:40:59 <Dot_> DUB

23:43:36 <Cane> You need a viking beard to make the æ ø å sounds properly Camail, that's true.
23:44:02 <Cane> You yell profanities and they get filtered through your beard into vowels
23:46:01 <carcinisation> yolo finding the angry ppl to play against
