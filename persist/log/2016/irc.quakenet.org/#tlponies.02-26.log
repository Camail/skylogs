04:46:54 <Bio> 220+ man-games lost to injury this season
04:47:05 <Bio> its fucking a miracle we are so high in the standings
04:50:44 <Crisium> ouch
04:51:16 <Bio> and we just lost another top line forward tonight
04:52:25 <Bio> Steen, Pietrangelo, Elliott and now Lehtera
04:52:57 <Bio> Ott might just be injured for good, and reaves is suspended 2 more games
04:53:26 <Camail> they should wear more padding, like pillows.
04:53:35 <Bio> prolly
04:54:53 <Crisium> it is impressive the blues are doing so well in the good division
04:55:07 <Crisium> best division in the league
04:55:16 <Crisium> theyd be in 1st place by a lot if they were pacific
04:55:47 <Crisium> well, maybe not cause they have a lot of games up on LA, but still

23:07:01 <Yolteotl> http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/20742714240
23:13:27 <DoT`> yea, increasing the time after drop is probably the way to go
23:13:48 <Yolteotl> I'd like to remove / nerf the medivac boost too
23:14:04 <Yolteotl> when in tankivac
23:14:40 <Yolteotl> divide the time needed by 2 for example
23:16:40 <DoT`> isnt the boost really important vs things like muta
23:17:22 <Yolteotl> for back up, yes, it could be less good
23:18:04 <Yolteotl> but you could but it could be coupled with the medivac upgrade
23:18:11 <DoT`> oh, i see what you mean, but blizzard almost never does changes like that for individual units
23:18:11 <Yolteotl> that no one does actually
23:18:33 <reification> night all

23:19:21 <DoT`> ther eis a medivac upgrade?
23:19:26 <Yolteotl> ahaha

23:20:45 <DoT`> hmm, i cant find that upgrade
23:21:03 <Yolteotl> http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Medivac_(Legacy_of_the_Void)#Upgrades
23:21:49 <DoT`> i could only find the wings and hots medivac entry

23:28:24 <DoT`> depends of you actually said something constructive this times
23:28:40 <Yolteotl> don't be silly, i'm always constructive.
23:28:51 <DoT`> oh yes, haha
23:29:20 <DoT`> whats a malus
23:29:28 <Yolteotl> not a english word?
23:29:29 <DoT`> google says a pland
23:29:29 <Yolteotl> shit
23:29:35 <DoT`> plant
23:29:47 <Yolteotl> penalty
23:29:51 <DoT`> malice maybe?
23:30:08 <DoT`> its not really right in that situation, but one could use it
23:30:13 <DoT`> penalty is right
23:31:38 <Yolteotl> we are using malus for insurance, when you drive without any accident, you get a bonus (it costs less)
23:31:49 <Yolteotl> then if you are a bad driver, you get a malus
23:32:13 <DoT`> penalty is i think the direct translation[
