02:44:58 <Camail> like the HM one does
02:45:01 <Bio> yeh
02:45:23 <Camail> also
02:45:26 <Camail> if you need food int he mines
02:45:28 <Camail> bring your hoe
02:45:37 <Camail> till the dirt patches (where the diglets are)
02:45:42 <Camail> you can get cave carrots!
02:52:03 <DoT`> cam, can you change the object being copied?
03:16:40 <Camail> yes but it destroys the original gem
03:18:27 <DoT`> ah, ok
03:18:37 <DoT`> the skull cave is pretty tough going
03:19:07 <DoT`> im assuming once you reach far enough you get some way back up/down
03:19:23 <DoT`> but I tihnk thats a winter thing to do
03:19:39 <Camail> i dont think so, i tihnk its free for all
03:19:42 <Camail> or at least lvl 25
03:19:46 <Camail> which is what i got a quest for
03:19:59 <Camail> but i got a lava katan and 20% attack boost
03:20:05 <Camail> cost me... a lot of money
03:20:12 <Camail> more than a house
03:20:24 <Camail> so I'm gonna fuck some people up soon
03:22:32 <Camail> half-way done with the community center...man this thing takes awhile
03:23:00 <DoT`> i thought i saved some gold parsnips but cant find them >.>
03:23:46 <Camail> rip
03:23:55 <Camail> i didnt have any of those crops
03:23:57 <Camail> I kinda forgot
03:24:03 <DoT`> and i had no rain at all the first spring
03:24:05 <DoT`> so no eel
03:24:06 <Camail> so that single thing is gonna be a year bottleneck, basically
03:24:11 <DoT`> not ONE day of rain
03:24:15 <Camail> git gud
03:24:18 <DoT`> haha
03:24:38 <Camail> i cant wait to make as many iridium sprinklers as possible
03:24:49 <Camail> potatoes everywhere
03:24:57 <Camail> or maybe parsnips
03:25:08 <Camail> probably parsnips, if those are the most effective
03:25:23 <Camail> nah, potatoes
03:25:35 <Camail> god damn i lvoe this song
03:25:38 <Camail> fits so well
03:25:46 <Camail> and the little spirits dancing :3
03:26:20 <Camail> oh dot i found a use for my fishing perk mistake
03:26:26 <Camail> got to 10 and you can make crab pots not need bait
03:26:34 <Camail> so now i have a steady supply of sashimi
03:26:46 <Camail> so much fish all day
03:27:55 <DoT`> sound slike it worked out good
03:28:11 <Camail> I'm still so sad tho
03:28:19 <Camail> i guess fishing doesnt make much money, tbh
03:29:50 <Camail> dot make sure to find 9 things for your grange!
03:29:55 <Camail> variety, quality, and price
03:30:06 <Camail> be mindful of your granger abilities
03:30:22 <Camail> I'm a lvl 20 granger, whatever the fuck that means?
03:30:43 <DoT`> ?
03:31:08 <Camail> if you dont save some gold stuff u gonna be fucked out of getting a star fruit thing
03:31:24 <Camail> well not really but it'll make you waste a good 10 minutes of your life grinding fishing mini games
03:31:37 <DoT`>  "I'm a lvl 20 granger"?
03:31:41 <DoT`> oh, at the fair?
03:31:54 <Camail> no like, hover over your character
03:31:55 <DoT`> i have some gold things for the stand
03:32:03 <Camail> It says lvl 20 for me
03:32:09 <Camail> in ivnentory
03:32:09 <DoT`> oh. mim a lvl 18 farmboy
03:32:11 <Camail> inventory*
03:32:19 <Camail> i dont know what that means
03:32:22 <DoT`> nope
03:32:25 <DoT`> but i do farm

03:34:47 <DoT`> so good
03:38:25 <DoT`> i tihn kits maybe animal starting time
03:39:58 <Camail> oh cool, you can kinda grow crops in winter
03:40:04 <Camail> by using wild seeds
03:43:47 <DoT`> yay, got 3 anient seeds form 1 fruit
03:44:36 <DoT`> ancient*
03:48:10 <Camail> nice
03:49:06 <DoT`> i think im poorer than i was my last game
03:49:34 <DoT`> but probably further along qiucker
03:49:56 <DoT`> but for some reason im getting no gold corn, half way through fall and only 3 so far
03:50:18 <DoT`> i blame the fortune teller! because i dont listen to her
03:50:42 <Camail> yea i have no idea what that means
03:50:55 <Camail> is it a minor rng manipulation?
03:50:59 <Camail> and in what way?
03:51:00 <Camail> so weird
03:51:03 <DoT`> i tihnk so
03:51:21 <Camail> it doesnt change what i'm gonna do
03:51:25 <Camail> gonna harvest when i can
03:51:30 <DoT`> i tihnk for instance if she say you will have good luck , those are the days when you keep pulling gold star fish  and that kind of thing

03:55:39 <Camail> gold star fish?
03:55:54 <Camail> you can get gold fish easy if you fish int he right places
03:56:05 <Camail> as long as you fish deep into water its 100%
03:56:31 <DoT`> i normaly try fish as far from land as possible
03:56:42 <DoT`> but only can get silver form the river in town
03:56:54 <Camail> I've only ever gotten gold stars since like, fishing lvl 4
03:57:01 <Camail> never fish int he river itself
03:57:05 <Camail> below leah's house
03:57:13 <Camail> that the best place for river fishing, the river is really wide

17:39:01 <DuT`> but yea
17:39:04 <Camail> i dunno if getting iridium tools is even worth the effort
17:39:05 <DuT`> its a hard choice
17:39:12 <Camail> sprinklers seem like the best bet, tbh
17:39:19 <DuT`> axe i dont think so
17:39:26 <Camail> i hate how slow the charge up on tools is
17:39:44 <DuT`> pickaxe maybe? because it will be quicker to get through the skull mine
