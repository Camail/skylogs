01:39:26 <DuB`> They beat kingdom, who beat c9.
01:39:29 <DuB`> Meh.
01:39:51 <ZK> these new sc2 maps :o
01:39:53 <ZK> so pretty
01:45:06 <skram> maybe i was wrong DuB`
01:45:47 <DuB`> C9 payload offense is way shaky today.
01:45:48 <DuB`> :T
01:46:50 <skram> what a bunch of noobs
01:47:08 <skram> maybe its because  they are still like 3/6 NA
01:47:14 <skram> get some more EU bros in there
01:48:52 <DuB`> Phew.
01:48:55 <DuB`> Got 'em!
01:48:59 <DuB`> Back to reading~
01:49:07 <skram> sure
01:49:09 <skram> "reading"
01:49:14 <DuB`> ??
01:50:11 <skram> I bet you're gonna work on that c9 high school romance drama fanfiction you've been dreaming about
01:50:34 <skram> or maybe its one of those roller derby things
01:53:31 <Camail> dub go to sleep
01:54:17 <DuB`> 7pm!
01:56:50 <Camail> and?
02:09:21 <Dot`> .roll d20 to boop zk
02:09:28 <ZK> oi
02:09:31 <ZK> .roll d20 to boop Dot`
02:09:38 <skram> good job boys
02:09:53 <Dot`> its immpresive
02:12:06 <DuB`> .roll d20 to boop dot
02:12:16 <DuB`> Git gud
02:15:12 <ZK> fine dub is good
02:19:51 <Cane> Oh my god the people who made STALKER are flaming retards
02:19:55 <Cane> I'm surprised it even runs at ALL
02:20:27 <skram> Cane's descent into madness: Day 6
02:20:53 <skram> You alright cane?
02:21:01 <DuB`> :P
02:21:11 <Dot`> he gone
02:22:04 <Cane> How the fuck do you come to the conclusion that the best way to tell the game which items use which upgrade schematics is NOT to have everything in a convenient couple of .xml files, but rather six interconnected files of different types and syntaxes that all interconnect in a way I am convinced is about to summon Cthulhu?
02:23:02 <Cane> I would say "I hope this made sense to the people who made it" but if this makes sense to anybody but a lunatic cultist trying to summon Cthulhu I don't want to live on this planet any more.
02:23:19 <skram> Stalker was made by russians, right?
02:23:55 <Cane> Ukrainians.
02:23:56 <skram> So devs were probably paid in vodka and verbal abuse
02:24:00 <Cane> So, yeah.
02:24:02 <skram> ...Same thing applies
02:24:20 <Cane> All I wanted to do was fix a helmet that was missing an upgrade.
02:24:26 <Cane> Now I'm in the Minotaur's Labyrinth.
02:24:50 <Cane> And don't even get me bloody started on their proprietary 3D model files.
02:24:59 <skram> Maybe thats why that stalker mod thing was so awful
02:25:01 <Cane> They decided industry standard wasn't good enough for them.
02:25:24 <Cane> skram: You think the people who made STALKERSOUP started off normal and sane, but slowly devolved into insane slav over the course of learning how to program this shit?
02:25:24 <skram> After traversing ungodly code they regressed to the mental state of a 14 year old
02:25:27 <Cane> It's entirely possible at this point.
02:26:09 <skram> It sure seems that way
02:26:10 <Cane> I am just astonished that this is how the upgrades work.
02:26:20 <Cane> The weapons were easy!
02:26:22 <Camail> Cane my guess is that 6 people were working on it
02:26:37 <Camail> and they figured out a way to duct tape them all together
02:27:59 <Cane> Okay, I think I know what I need to do.
02:28:07 <skram> Fire?
02:28:16 <Cane> I'm going to start fucking with random files in the upgrade tree and see if the game will explode.
02:28:35 <Cane> Maybe I can *remove* upgrades first, that'll put me on the path to enlightenment.
02:29:14 <DuB`> Fun game. :o
02:29:35 <ZK> hows the witcher dub?
02:29:57 <DuB`> Gewd.
