18:28:29 <Yolteotl> dot?
18:28:31 <DoT`> i assume you saw this? https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/47hfai/artosis_thoughts_on_tankivacs_and_why_lotv_is_so/
18:28:56 <Yolteotl> yep, and i don't really agree :P
18:30:03 <Yolteotl>  tankivacs are okay in TvP/TvZ
18:30:09 <Yolteotl> but they are ruining TvT
18:30:21 <Yolteotl> it's like when you had only mutmut vs mutmut in Zvz
18:30:46 <DoT`> i still like the idea of unsiege on pickup
18:30:55 <Yolteotl> you can't play any other play style, full mech, full bio because of it
18:30:57 <DoT`> but blizazard doesnt seem to care for that
18:31:13 <Yolteotl> yes, it's an ok idea, a bit unfriendly I think
18:31:36 <DoT`> well add a damage buff to tanks too maybe at the same time, so a mid of the 2
18:32:11 <Yolteotl> how it could work, can you pick up only one tank ? Will it be unsieged inside the medivacs ? Letting a second slot for another tank
18:32:31 <Yolteotl> or would it be unsieged when you dropped it
18:32:39 <DoT`> i forget unseiged tanks can go in medivacs as they never do that
18:32:43 <Yolteotl> :D
18:32:46 <DoT`> haha
18:32:52 <Yolteotl> yes, you can put 2 in it
18:33:04 <DoT`> ya, i recall now
18:33:13 <DoT`> well make it only fit 1 :P problem solved
18:33:19 <Yolteotl> The idea seems interesting, but I don't know, it seems weird in some way
18:34:13 <Yolteotl> bblizzard is a bit slow to act dot, this idea was not supported by big name before this week
18:34:36 <Yolteotl> they may talk about it in tomorrow community feedback
18:35:22 <DoT`> which idea are you talking abou tnow?

22:49:40 <Phearlock> I've been playing other stuff a bit lately, flight sims, Civ 5, bit of From the Depths.
22:50:03 <DoT`> is thier long war planned for xcom 2?
22:50:18 <Phearlock> Legendary does a good job of being relatively long.
22:50:34 <DoT`> always need more xcom though
22:50:51 <Phearlock> But yeah while I don't think the same team is working on one, there's probably going to be plenty of stuff that overhauls content and adds stuff
22:51:02 <DoT`> cool
22:51:08 <Phearlock> Mostly just waiting to see if there's going to be any performance optimization patches
22:51:29 <DoT`> there where performance issues?
22:51:49 <Phearlock> Yeah there's a lot of annoying frame drops here and there that my 980 simply shouldn't have.
22:51:54 <DoT`> bio, i did art thing, lets try bot killing, then maybe more art
22:52:02 <DoT`> sucks phear :/
