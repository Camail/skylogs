01:05:35 <Rawr|Phone> I am trying
01:07:58 * skram soaks DuB`s sucks in egg
01:08:15 <DuB`> ... ?!?
01:08:43 <skram> I heard a good tip on the MOMS AGAINST VACCINATION facebook page and thats that egg soaked wool socks are very helpful against a cold
01:08:54 <skram> water mixed with silver works too they say
01:09:12 <DoT`> surely only during the fool moon
01:09:26 <DoT`> i have never known silver to work at other times
01:10:17 <DuB`> Oh dear.
01:10:34 * DuB` 's feet smell eggy.
01:10:47 <DoT`> like french toast?
01:10:52 <skram> But youre s00per healthy now!
01:10:55 <skram> s00per d00per
01:11:22 <DuB`> If I have sores in my mouth should I suck on egg-socks?
01:11:34 <skram> yep
01:11:42 <skram> maybe snort some garlic or lemon juice in your eye
01:12:09 <DuB`> Snort... eye.
01:12:22 <DoT`> you know what fixxes everything, coconut oil
01:12:47 <skram> no dont snort eyes, thats for huntingtons
01:13:14 <DuB`> I'm just trying to figure out how to snort with my eyeball, skrma.
01:13:27 <DoT`> ive seen it done
01:13:36 <DoT`> you are just not trying hard enough dub
01:13:40 <skram> you use your nose for snorting dub, please take this seriously
01:14:08 * DuB` dies, medicine is too hard.
01:14:39 <skram> your butt energy is all wrong, you need magnetic bracelet and a pint of laxatives to purge all the malicious energy
01:14:42 <skram> out from your butt
01:14:57 <skram> trust me, im a certified homeopathic doctor person
01:15:15 <DuB`> -homeo +socio
01:15:27 <DoT`> .tag skram a certified homeopathic doctor person
01:16:45 <skram> a sociopath would tell you to cut of your head to alleviate symptoms, a homeopath would give you some dirt in a paper bag and charge you 300$

02:39:01 <skram> for 5 year old skram
02:39:04 <DoT`> how swedish
02:39:10 <skram> finnish actually
02:39:23 <DoT`> i was terrified of wolves as a kid thanks to fairy tales
02:39:47 <DoT`> they turned out to be far less of a problem than expected
02:40:10 <skram> sorta like quicksand
02:40:32 <DuB`>  In africa and london, dot? Yes. :P
02:40:39 <DoT`> suprisingly we had a dog that was 75% wolf 25% german shepard which i loved  not scary at all
02:40:59 <DoT`> exactly dub, be logical with like 5 year old me
02:41:13 <skram> i had a cat that was 100% cat and she was only mildly terrifying
02:41:22 <DoT`> cats are like that skram
02:41:34 <skram> dogs are too needy
02:41:50 <DuB`> There were wolves around here at some point in the past.
02:41:51 <skram> i want someone that despises me to pet
02:41:56 <DuB`> But now they're basically endagered.
02:41:58 <DoT`> that depends on breed and the owners
02:43:00 <skram> maybe i should get a moose hunting dog
02:43:05 <skram> i dont hunt but i can pretend its not useless
02:43:13 <DoT`> like a cat?
02:43:22 <skram> plus they have the tail that goes @ which is kinda neat
02:43:25 <skram> dot please
02:43:28 <skram> cats kill mice
02:43:36 <DoT`> because mice are everywhere
02:43:50 <skram> obviously not near the cat for long
02:43:52 <DoT`> they also bring them inside and leave them dead lying around
02:44:42 <skram> yes its very proud and want you to notice
02:44:51 <DoT`> so not neady at all
02:44:57 <skram> course not
02:45:01 <DoT`> ok
02:45:05 <skram> its one of those high school anime dramas
02:45:11 <skram> tsundere or whatever the fuck its called
02:45:25 <DoT`> you once again prove your knowledge of anime
02:45:40 <DuB`> B-baka!
02:45:53 <skram> im a regular at r/tsunderesharks dot
02:45:57 <DuB`> It's not like I brought this mouse FOR you, or anything!
02:46:39 <skram> http://i.imgur.com/rvBUWD5.png
02:46:40 <DoT`> well i guess thats how i see cats now, all anime
02:46:45 <skram> its middle school all over again
02:47:01 <DuB`> ... I don't think I've ever seen a wild mouse outside of camping.
02:48:09 <DoT`> well you dont have a cat to bring you dead ones
02:49:52 <skram> problem solved
02:49:55 <skram> get a cat dub
02:50:05 <DuB`> I don't WANT to see mice!
02:50:20 <DuB`> And the fact that I haven't tells me that there is no problem in the first place.
02:50:49 <skram> meh they sorta show up
02:52:15 <DoT`> if you live in a forest
02:52:30 <DoT`> mice are cute anyway
02:52:35 <DoT`> why you want them ded?
02:52:52 <skram> because they are rodents?
02:52:59 <skram> they bring sickness and deaths?
02:53:00 <DoT`> so are rabbits
02:53:03 <DoT`> and squrrials
02:53:16 <DuB`> yubiwa
02:53:17 <DoT`> we are not in the dark ages skram, please
02:53:19 <DuB`> Whoops.
02:53:24 <skram> Yes but rabbits dont eat your walls and shits all over your house
02:53:49 <DoT`> mice are easy to catch and release away from your house
02:54:09 <skram> very easy to kill aswell
02:54:13 <DoT`> >:(
02:55:51 <skram> i had mice in my car dot
02:55:58 <skram> it ate my carpet and shat in the trunk
02:56:04 <skram> no tears shed over its death
02:56:24 <DuB`> Once on camp a mouse refused to leave our tent. 
02:56:28 <DuB`> We couldn't chase it out.
02:56:34 <DuB`> So we smased it with a flashlight.
02:57:06 <DuB`> Smashed*
02:58:06 <DoT`> ....
02:58:15 <DoT`> whats with you ppl
02:58:20 <skram> circle of life or somesuch
02:58:46 <DoT`> did you eat the mouse? because otherwise i dont think that counts skram
02:59:33 <skram> no i gave it back to the earth so it could sustain new life
02:59:58 <DuB`> Yeh, throw it out in the bushes.
03:01:22 <Bio> rtz and universe went to secret

03:04:59 <Camail> omg kbrad just got beyond bodied
03:05:32 <Camail> also wtf dub
03:05:45 <Camail> you will kill a muse instead of just trapping it
03:05:50 <Camail> you murderer
03:07:02 <DuB`> Well I wasn't the actual smash-er.
03:07:50 <DoT`> im not sure it makes sense, if its slow enough to hit with a torch, how could you fail to put a bowl over it
03:09:39 <DuB`> I don't think we had anything so convenient.
03:10:06 <Bio> murder!
03:10:22 <DoT`> what where you eating out of?
03:10:35 <DoT`> bowls > plates when camping

16:49:29 <DoT`> you are very swedish
16:49:48 <skram> Pffft. Lotsa people had the same trouble on the internets
16:49:59 <skram> I even found a super easy tutorial to fix it.
16:50:05 <DoT`> yes, the internets
16:51:37 <DoT`> what was it doing?
16:52:13 <skram> You know when you boot after updates it says "preparing to configure windows after blah blah blah" and then sometimes it reboots
16:52:22 <skram> it did that to infinity
16:52:27 <DoT`> lol
16:53:07 <DoT`> did you shout at your pc when it happend?
16:53:27 <DoT`> thats my go to response
16:53:52 <skram> i shouted and cried and sang
16:54:28 <skram> I had to boot to cmd and move some files or something and it made me feel l33t

22:58:16 <reification> hi dotties
22:58:33 <ZK> why starcraft so hard
22:58:50 <reification> you chose wrong race
23:03:16 <DoT|Phone1> Cleary be terran
23:03:23 <DoT|Phone1> freedom for all
23:08:37 <ZK> as soon as they have ladder per race
23:08:48 <ZK> protoss doesnt seem fun at all to me
23:11:04 <reification> then you need more storm drops
23:19:14 <ZK> so hard to do well
