01:17:07 <Camail> SETTLE DOWN DUB
01:17:19 <Dot`> he is too far gone
01:19:04 <Camail> 3 out of 10 of the streams i follow arent playing overwatch
01:19:19 <motbob> i'm losing connection a lot
01:20:10 <Camail> have the servers been able to handle it in general?
01:20:34 <skram> servers been completely fine in eu so far
01:20:38 <motbob> gameplay seems fine
01:20:56 <skram> no lag, no ping, and finding matches np
01:21:07 <Camail> no ping? so disconnected?
01:21:16 <Camail> XD
01:21:18 <Camail> XD XD XD XD
01:21:19 <skram> no ping issues rather
01:21:24 <Camail> XXXXDDDDDDDDDD
01:21:24 <skram> yeah yeah
01:21:27 <Camail> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
01:21:29 <Camail> DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
01:21:49 <skram> no need to act out just because you are jealous
01:21:55 <Camail> of what
01:22:10 <Dot`> bardums tux
01:22:30 <Camail> I own that tux more than he does
01:23:29 <Camail> unrelated topic: there's a guy who etches dicks inside his products
01:23:32 <Camail> he's a prop maker
01:23:36 <Dot`> you claim your world has no tux, meaning iys the intelectual prperty of its creator bardum
01:23:37 <Camail> and he puts a dick in every one
01:23:48 <Dot`> lol
01:23:50 <Camail> bardum is my property
01:25:07 <Camail> so does soldier 76's ult increase his damage or just give him aim bot
01:25:13 <Camail> i hope it does more than that
01:25:25 <Dot`> increase reload
01:25:37 <Camail> i am unimpressed
01:25:49 <Dot`> might do more, im not sure
01:26:02 <Dot`> but no shots missing is pretty damn good
01:26:09 <Dot`> no spread
01:26:38 <Camail> yea but what if someone's just really good
01:26:57 <Dot`> then they play mcree
01:27:08 <ZK> lol
01:27:10 <Dot`> also if they are bad
01:27:32 <ZK> so mcree is better than 76, however you need skill?
01:27:55 <Dot`> mcree you can just right click and get kills
01:28:15 <Dot`> but if you can aim his left click is good
01:35:27 <skram> mcree is bullshit
01:35:50 <skram> Hes a sniper but his best skill is getting into faces and rightclicking
01:41:31 <Camail> the nerfed his damage range tho
01:41:37 <Camail> pre-nerf he was a sniper
01:42:36 <Dot`> he is still usefull at range, just not op anymore
01:42:52 <Camail> aka there is a reason to pick widow maker now

23:39:04 <reification> i sleep now
23:40:14 <DoT`> gnight reif <3
23:40:38 <DoT`> Runbunny, is this the first step to catgirls? http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36344155
23:41:55 <Runbunny> let me look up the paper.
23:45:07 <DoT`> Phearlock, https://derpibooru.org/1162231
23:45:12 <DoT`> ponies are heavy D
23:45:15 <DoT`> D:
23:47:07 <Phearlock> they're also magical
23:47:38 <DoT`> i mean pegasus must be lighter bine structure
23:48:07 <DoT`> bone*
23:48:16 <Phearlock> I know enough aerodynamics to be 100% sure there is no way ponies are capable of flight without some way of cheating both gravity, drag, and fluid dynamics
23:49:17 <skram> well how much thrust does a pony pooper have
23:49:32 <Runbunny> Nah Dot that won't help make catgirls.
23:49:42 <Phearlock> the main thing about pony flight is
23:49:46 <Phearlock> there is a big lack of control
23:50:13 <DoT`> dissapointing for you runbun
23:50:17 <Runbunny> There wasn't even a paper. 
23:50:18 <Phearlock> no tail feathers, big wide head is at the front.
23:50:18 <Runbunny> like.
23:51:28 <Runbunny> I kinda thought what they did was obvious.
23:52:09 <Runbunny> It's done all the time with bacteria and plants. Don't know why people haven't tried it on enzymes.
23:52:28 <DoT`> well they made a fair amount of money form doing it
23:52:31 <Runbunny> probablly since there is no easy way to do it.
23:53:07 <Runbunny> if they developed a method of done it easily, then they could become very rich and stuff.
23:53:28 <DoT`> Being tricky does normaly get in peoples way
23:55:07 <Runbunny> mutations are usually random.
23:56:28 <DoT`> look runbun, cat ears are a mutation, is that not what you want?
23:59:46 <Runbunny> they aren't really though..
