00:28:01 <DuB`> My brother has been watching old seagull OW vods 'n stuff all week.
00:28:07 <DuB`> Every time I look over, +salt.
00:28:13 <DuB`> Waaaaaaant.
00:30:30 <Camail> pls settle
00:30:36 <Camail> this lust is unbecoming of you
00:30:37 <ZK> you should play some sc2 to take your mind off things DuB`
00:40:39 <Camail> oh wow i didnt realize that the eldritch knight is similar to 4e's swordmage
00:49:00 <Camail> omg booming blade and lightning lure were in 4e
00:53:09 <Raelcun> Cam, I rolled fora d ruid the other week got the dumbest rolls
00:53:13 <Raelcun> 18 16 16 15 13 11
00:53:26 <Raelcun> Then of course we didn't wind up using that character Q_Q
00:53:34 <Camail> similar to phears
00:53:57 <Raelcun> So now I have 15 14 13 12 12 11
00:54:16 <Camail> pre-racial bonuses?
00:54:16 <Raelcun> I've always kind of had bullshit stat luck in D&D though
00:54:20 <Raelcun> yeah pre-recial
00:54:25 <Raelcun> have 17 str cuz human
00:54:33 <Camail> 5e?
00:54:39 <Raelcun> Pathfinder for this campaign
00:54:43 <Camail> ah
00:54:55 <Camail> mild confusion as 5e humans have +1 to everything
00:54:57 <Raelcun> I've never done 5e beyond oneshots have you played with the system much?
00:55:02 <Camail> I'm DMing
00:55:04 <Camail> tlpdnd
00:55:20 <Camail> we've had 7-8 sessions
00:55:22 <Raelcun> Well have you done it before? xD
00:55:30 <Raelcun> I'm curious about the system cuz I've never gotten super deep into it
00:55:49 <Camail> 5e is quite fun, carefully designed, and simplified
00:56:00 -!- Phant [webchat@cpe-104-175-76-38.socal.res.rr.com] has joined #tlponies
00:56:01 <ZK> It's fun and simple, probly less in depth than pathfinder when creating characters from what I've heard. Never played pathfinder much though :/
00:56:03 <Camail> its the easiest to learn and get started, but there is plenty to learn
00:56:14 <Raelcun> The whole optional feats thing is a bit weird to me
00:56:25 <Camail> it puts feats ont he backburner big time
00:56:42 <Camail> feats are no longer a huge deal, only for specific characters
00:56:54 <Raelcun> Yeah there's way less of them too right?
00:56:58 <Camail> which I'm fine with, its far easier to understand
00:57:02 <Camail> yea like 10-ish
00:57:20 <Raelcun> I'd be curious to hear your impressions again a few months down the road after you've played with it more
00:58:24 <ZK> I thoguht you hadn't played much pathfinder beforehand cam?
00:58:28 <Camail> I have a pretty deep impression of it as it stands, its an obvious improvement from 4e
00:58:42 <Camail> I amde a few pathfinder cahracters and played irl
00:58:47 <ZK> oh kk
00:59:32 <Raelcun> Pathfinder is fun but it has definite problems
00:59:47 <Raelcun> They tried to fix 3.5 and introduced a whole bunch of new issues, especially with all the extra content they keep adding on
00:59:51 <Camail> in 5e the rules being simpler and more literally defined means that its less volatile
01:00:03 <Raelcun> Yeah I never really liked 4e
01:00:05 <Camail> less prone to boring power gamers
01:00:28 <ZK> 4e really seemed to force a gamestyle
01:00:29 <Camail> skills are simplified, which is nice
01:00:39 <Camail> makes each individual one more worthwhile
01:01:23 <Camail> spell lists for each class are way better
01:01:37 <Raelcun> So my pathfinder character wound up a bit ridiculous
01:01:52 <Raelcun> I was designing the character and pointed out a silly way to semi-minmax it and the DM goaded me into doing it
01:02:10 <Raelcun> It wound up being A LOT more powerful than both of us expected
01:02:22 <Camail> aka a pathfinder character
01:02:32 <Raelcun> At level 3 I can gain 3 natural weapon attacks, get +6 to str, and go up a size category.
01:02:41 <Raelcun> 1d8+8 x2 and 2d6+8 
01:02:48 <ZK> t.t
01:02:49 <Raelcun> I did 54 damage in a round
01:02:59 <Phant> RIP.
01:03:53 <Raelcun> We're probably gonna swap some of that out
01:04:02 <Camail> also advantage and disadvantage are huge
01:04:08 <Camail> the biggest system change so far
01:04:09 <Raelcun> Oh yeah I really like the advantage system
01:04:16 <Raelcun> Inspiration is fun
01:04:23 <Raelcun> Make the DM laugh, gain inspiration
01:04:31 <Camail> it makes decisions so much more important
01:04:58 <Camail> inspiration is hard to judge because its entirely DM dependent
01:05:28 <Camail> I am only gonna give it out for exceptionally interesting things, or at the culmination of a personal series of events
01:05:37 <Camail> because inspiration is so strong
01:06:14 <Raelcun> Yeah I"ve done several oneshots and it seems best to give it out for really great in character stuff and keep it rare, or give it out freely including the DMs that do it when you make them laugh so it's just an interesting decision
01:07:25 <Camail> handing inspiration out a lot is fine if you want the players to be powerful, its the same mentality about the frequency of magic items
01:07:50 <Camail> give out +1 shit at the end of every dungeon and things will feel good
01:09:53 <ZK> in one-shots i did, inspiration was a lot of fun cause the DM just shot you an extra die. Using that extra die irl is fun
01:38:10 <FlutterAi_> ?episode
01:38:49 <ZK> wut, emoticons are a thing in sc2 t.t
02:24:07 <Camail> warcaster feat + booming blade is a great combo
02:24:39 <Camail> AoO with booming blade is a cantrip that does +1d8 juzt cuz

14:31:38 <DoT`> dub, how to hide somatic part of spell. Start by reading books when you get the chance, muttering as you go, once he is use to you beign weird he wont suspect a thing!
14:31:40 <DoT`> easy :P
14:31:52 <DuB`> Verbal?
14:31:54 <DuB`> Yeah.
14:31:57 <DoT`> or he might distrust us and lock you away when you bring a book out
14:32:04 <DuB`> I had a plan similar to that.
14:32:08 <DoT`> one way to find out
14:32:39 <DuB`> I was gonna pretend to have a habit of doing soft chanting/etc. to calm nerves or something. :P
14:32:52 <DuB`> As soon as he's used to it... BAM free hippogriff.
14:33:06 <DoT`> he is pretty high level
14:33:17 <DoT`> and if he resists he will know something happend
14:33:28 <DoT`> wait for us to be gone
14:34:24 <DuB`> No, he won't.
14:34:46 <skram> no mroe spells for anyone ever
14:34:50 <skram> it never turns out well

14:36:16 <skram> probably
14:38:29 <DoT`> yea, he will get a sense i think that he was being proded
