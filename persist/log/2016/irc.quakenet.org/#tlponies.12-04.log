10:18:05 <Cane> Okay, time for Bisu to wreck Larva so we can kick off ASL season 2 properly.
10:18:07 <Cane> This won't take long.
10:27:54 <Cane> .tell DoT` Just fixed a crash that never should have happened. I don't know if it's CoC or STCoP WP causing it, but a scope that does not exist was added to loot tables so my game exploded when I tried to open a stash that had it as an entry.

11:36:16 <DoT`> ok
11:36:41 <Micen_> commercials? Time to do some decorating. 
11:36:44 <Micen_> afk while these run
11:37:21 <DoT`> haha cane, mystery scope!
11:37:32 <DoT`> that must have beeen fun to track down 
11:38:03 <Cane> No, I was surprised that the error message when the game crashed told me exactly what was wrong!
11:38:17 <Cane> I knew that scope did not exist when I saw the "could not find mesh" issue.
11:38:27 <Cane> I've no idea why it's in the loot tables.
11:38:32 <DoT`> spoooky
11:38:40 <DoT`> and what if
11:38:43 <Cane> I'm starting to run into issues in my game atm though.
11:39:22 <Cane> Instability, crashes happening with higher regularity than before. Mostly with random generic messages so you never know what's doing it.
11:39:32 <Cane> Could be my fault for running a few mods.
11:39:47 <Cane> I am beginning to worry about CoC's stability though.
11:39:56 <Cane> It's supposed to be a modder's base that people can build on top of...
11:40:07 <Cane> But if it's barely holding together as it is, and you start adding mods...
11:40:10 <Cane> I dunno.
11:40:51 <Cane> Anyway, taking a break from STALKER for a couple of days. Hopefully the new Deus Ex overhaul mod will be out soon.
11:41:06 <DoT`> what if cane the error message didnt say what was wrong clearly, your just http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/matrix19.jpg
11:41:09 <Cane> Well, new version of the critically acclaimed mod that already exists.
11:41:12 <DoT`> its happening!
