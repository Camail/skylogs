19:36:38 <Camail> THE CLAMS ARE EATING ME
19:36:40 <Camail> SAVE YOURSELF
19:36:46 <Camail> ADFKJGLAEIUFGNALRWEUGAAERGAAAAA
19:36:57 <skram> what level are you DuB`
19:37:03 <Camail> 5000
19:37:09 <skram> shush you
19:37:19 <DuB`> 47
19:37:27 <Camail> i was closer than you
19:40:54 <Camail> DuB` Dott` skram  scale of 1-10, how intereting is the egyptian setting to you
19:41:21 <DuB`> Wait.
19:41:25 <DuB`> Setting in what?
19:41:35 <Camail> scale of 1-10
19:41:37 <DuB`> Wat r u say
19:41:39 <Camail> gogo
19:41:59 <Camail> on a scale of meh to super cool, egyptian stuff
19:42:06 <Dott`> hmmmm
19:42:12 <DuB`> 6??
19:42:33 <Camail> k
19:42:38 <Camail> also you're wrong
19:42:40 <Dott`> 5/7
19:42:41 <Camail> its like an 11
19:42:48 <Camail> the correct answer is 11
19:42:53 <DuB`> Temple of Anubis is okay.
19:43:01 <DuB`> If that's what you mean Kappa
19:43:11 <Camail> omg i am glad venessa is dead
19:43:23 <Dott`> importnat cam, do the egyptions worhship cats or dogs?
19:43:41 <Camail> maybe
19:44:25 <Camail> well, depends on the person, univrsally its cats, though anubis is a thing
19:44:30 <Camail> and he's basically a dog
19:45:02 <Dott`> last i heard cats where actually not nearly as worshipped as thought
19:45:14 <Dott`> but there is a lot of diffrent aspects to egypt
19:45:21 <Rawr|Fone> It was wonderful runbunny
19:45:22 <Dott`> it lasted a very long time
19:45:22 <Camail> yup
19:46:37 <skram> cam
19:46:37 <skram> 6
19:46:46 <Dott`> yip, about 3500 years it lasted, till macedonion rule
19:47:02 <Dott`> 2500*
19:47:21 <Camail> yea but the culture was very stable so it didn't change as much as any other empire
19:47:38 <Camail> to the point where they assimilated 2 separate conquerers 
19:48:20 <Dott`> i tihnk dub and skram just dont know enough about egypt
19:48:38 <DuB`> Possible.
19:48:42 <Dott`> they should play more Pharaoh
19:50:23 <Dott`> any culture + old civilisation you dont know much about holds an interest due to mystery
19:51:01 <Camail> me and my brother started a homebrew egypt 3.5 campaign years ago that never got anywhere, was thinking  of doing something with it but its not gonna work if the players dont already love egypt
19:55:12 <Dott`> dub skram http://imgur.com/gallery/ggl40
19:58:25 <Runbunny> How many stoves did you sleep on?
19:59:31 <skram> does it require intimate knowledge of egyptian mythology
20:02:15 <Camail> none, you just have to think pyramids are dope and those eye make-up swirls are hot
20:02:31 <Camail> dnd already has the gods from 3.5
20:02:40 <Camail> but again, this isnt something i want to force
20:04:52 <Dott`> would it be in 3.5? 
20:08:39 <Rawr|Fone> Like three and a half runbunny
20:09:16 <Runbunny> Dang you scoundrel Rawr.
20:09:33 <Rawr|Fone> :3
20:12:11 <DuB`> Camail is pharah waifu, quite confirmed.
20:13:17 <DuB`> Reaver and surefour doing reaver and surefour things. 
20:17:26 <Runbunny> Light up your heart Camail.
20:17:45 <Runbunny> wait, light your heart up. 
20:17:50 <Runbunny> Yes that is the thing.

21:49:06 <DuB`> Yup.
21:49:55 <DuB`> He's the only dps hero isn't really countered by any of the others.
21:51:26 <Dott`> genji counters all
21:57:21 <DuB`> Not at all, dot!
21:57:22 <DuB`> Silly.

22:00:39 <Dott`> he knows im right
22:01:22 <DuB`> You know...
22:01:26 <DuB`> You can just NOT shoot him during reflect.
22:01:27 <DuB`> Y'know.
22:01:31 <Dott`> NO
22:01:33 <Dott`> must shoot
22:01:57 <skram> junkrat is the best genji counter
22:02:00 <DuB`> As he just sits there feeling silly while swish-swish-swish.
22:02:11 <Dott`> then you can just never shoot him dub! becuase he just waits to counter while moving closed
22:02:24 <skram> 80% of all genjis go and sword you but then they blow up because of the passive
22:02:35 <skram> trust me i know math
22:04:37 <Camail> i dont trust you
22:05:31 <skram> you should
22:07:17 <Camail> nah

22:16:10 <Rawr|Fone> What a nerd you are jonas
22:16:21 <skram> thanks girlfriend
22:16:55 <carcinisation> AK vs AT vs QQ for about 75k chips where 200 euro buyin gets you 5k chips...
22:17:09 <skram> big pot
22:17:23 <carcinisation> guy who won is now in first place
22:17:24 <skram> which hand did you have? :p
22:18:05 <carcinisation> had AQ vs AQ vs KK a bit earlier where the KK played it weird and let me escape with 2/3 of my stack
22:19:19 <carcinisation> well that dream is over, have to wait for the next live event satellites
22:24:46 <Bio> asdf
22:26:24 <DuB`> skram: My on fire rates are all awful, apparently I'm bad. :P
22:26:38 <skram> :D
22:26:49 <DuB`> Thought I'm not really even sure what contributes to that, i might just play off objective, etc too much.
22:27:14 <Bio> git gud
22:27:21 <DuB`> Liquid time!
22:27:21 <skram> Eh, elims, objective time, blocking and healing
22:28:02 <Rawr|Fone> Objective time is the most important one
22:28:19 <DuB`> Well then. :P
22:28:44 <skram> depends i guess
22:28:58 <skram> if you play lotsa genji you are probably not gonna spend much time on the objective
22:29:17 <skram> or tracer or any sort of flanking bro
22:30:40 <DuB`> "Stop crying, people. Mccree is easy to counter! All you have to do is flashband and hammer fan him."
22:30:41 <DuB`> Hahah.
22:30:52 <DuB`> flashbang
22:31:05 <skram> and then second mccree to counter the other mccree
22:31:13 <skram> and then all of a sudden its only mccrees forever
22:32:50 <Camail> oh man, after watching SG i almost downloaded it again
22:32:51 <Camail> luckily the desire has passed
22:33:03 <Camail> had to keep reminding myself that defense in that game was fucking awful
