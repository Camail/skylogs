20:15:35 <skram> I wonder what the budget on that series is Cane
20:15:44 <skram> with BBC they had millions per episode
20:16:00 <Cane> Dunno. What's Amazon Prime like? Do they have a lot of original shows like Netflix?
20:16:11 <ZK> it started pretty slow, took me 6 weeksmonth to read first 500 pages, but 4 days to read final 500.
20:16:32 <skram> No idea
20:16:34 <Cane> ZK, you finally got through it?
20:16:43 <ZK> yep yep, just fniished a minute ago
20:16:51 <Cane> I loved it. Great book. Second book is better.
20:17:11 <ZK> Cool cool, took a while to get into it, but then it's awesome
20:17:24 <ZK> but with 10 books, i can understand the first part needing to establish everything
20:17:32 <Cane> It does start kind of jumbled, and I didn't think I'd care for it that much until 2/3 of the way through.
20:17:37 <Cane> Yeah.
20:17:41 <Cane> Establishing Shot: The Book.
20:18:13 <Cane> It grew on me very quickly in the third act, and by the end I was hooked and wanted book two.
20:18:53 <ZK> Yea, pretty much, gonna start book 2 and gonna read all 10 books till the end!
20:18:54 <ZK> right?
20:19:08 <Dott> off you go zk
20:19:10 <Dott> enjoy
20:19:30 <Dott> its not like authors are there to torture us by not wiriting thier books
20:19:35 <Cane> Hahah, if you find book 3, could you let Sanderson know? I'm sure he'd love to be done with it.
20:20:27 <ZK> ill get him and rothfuss for sure
20:20:47 <ZK> oh shit, 2010, 2014, 2017 t.t
20:20:51 <ZK> thats a long delay between books
20:20:52 <Dott> zk, while your going just take the list, there are a lot of authors on it
20:21:09 <ZK> eh, i'll let Cane take a few and put thme in his basement
20:21:37 <Cane> Yeah, planning a basement for imprisoned authors where they get paid in grains of rice per word.
20:21:49 <Cane> McDonalds when they finish a chapter.
20:22:12 <ZK> so rothfuss gonna get a full meal since he finsihed book 3 a while back and just going through rewrites?
20:22:28 <Cane> Jim Butcher, Rothfuss, and Sanderson have already signed on to be in there. They don't know it yet, but they have.
20:22:50 <Dott> well we dont want to disturb thier writing just for a signature
20:24:56 <ZK> work on getting GRRM too please
20:26:42 <ZK> so anyhow, at the current rate, stormlight archive should be done by 2045. Yay
20:26:50 <ZK> fuck.
20:29:36 <Dott> oh, im sad now
20:29:46 <ZK> hm, maybe not, with wheel of time done and only mistborn in the way?
