00:37:49 <Camail> ZK  Dot_  Micen_  "A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest
00:37:49 <Camail>  in a 24-hour period"
00:40:50 <DuB`> Wow, nice pones.
00:41:45 <Camail> so yea for future reference guys, gotta wait a day to get another rest in
00:43:10 <ZK> if we go to bed at 2 am, can we go to bed at 10 pm the next day?
00:44:14 <Camail> vaguely
00:44:22 <Camail> so right now your sleep schedules are fucked
00:44:25 <Camail> art imitates life i guess
00:44:41 <Camail> but I'll allow a few hours of lenience one way or the other in order to correct them
01:10:21 <Camail> man
01:10:24 <Camail> smug sucks at sf5
01:10:45 <Camail> maybe its cuz he's focusing on school?

02:19:42 <Camail> oh wait zk were you asking if the dividing line for long rests was always 12 AM? if so no, its literally 24 hour periods
02:19:56 <Camail> oh wait
02:19:58 <Camail> I'm also dumb
02:20:03 <Camail> i read it right the first time
02:20:07 <ZK> yep
02:20:19 <Camail> also check ur pm
02:20:20 <Camail> u fuk
02:20:24 <Camail> fukbutter
02:25:56 <ZK> my thought on 24h period was to make it logical, say we seemed to have been awake for 14h, but really to play it by ear instead of asking if it's been 24h each day
02:27:36 <Camail> Yea I think being awake for at least 14 hours, or an extremely grueling shorter period, is all that is needed
02:27:43 <Camail> also long rests are 8 hours
02:28:00 <Camail> its just that you can't spend more than 2 hours on watch
02:28:10 <Camail> so if no one needs to go on watch it can be 6 hours
02:28:28 <Camail> it doesnt exactly say that last part tho
02:31:14 <ZK> eh, we can assume or houserule anyhow

16:35:04 <Camail> i was never told that
16:35:16 <DoT`> skram, did you know this?
16:37:35 <ZK> no, im kidding
16:37:37 <ZK> bad joke
16:37:43 <ZK> tried to be funny and failed horribly
16:37:44 <Phearlock> ZK worst pony
16:37:56 <ZK> rereading, it doesnt look like joke at all :/
16:37:59 <Phearlock> For like 10 mins.
16:38:08 <Phearlock> After that I'll forgive you
16:38:21 <ZK> i also thought skram was on, he aint

16:38:31 <DoT`> he was like 5 minutes ago
16:38:32 <Camail> pls
16:38:35 <Camail> 200 years dungeon
16:38:42 <ZK> yea i thought he would respond immediately
16:38:48 <Camail> 300
16:38:59 <Micen_> I am ready to stab Kyza with a +1 dagger :)
16:39:49 <DoT`> well im around now
16:39:52 <ZK> if you show the dagger, i'll attack you.
16:40:19 <ZK> Kyza doesn't like the fact you tried to trick her with an illusion to get your crossbow back
16:40:30 <Camail> lmao
16:41:06 <Camail> I have very low expectations for this session
16:41:25 <Micen> come on TPK
16:41:41 <Camail> no
16:41:42 <Camail> just you two
16:41:48 <Camail> rho and bardum will 100% survive
16:42:25 <Phearlock> PVP hype
16:42:41 <DoT`> so we are once again waiting on skram
16:43:53 <Camail> the pre-session prep time was filled with non-fun things so it wont start right when everyone gets here
16:45:21 <ZK> eh, Mynu couldve just been nice and given me the dagger, then decides instead to antagonize me some more with trickery. Then antagonizes the orc. Kyza dislikes Mynu even more now, if possible, then when she shot her.
16:46:13 <Camail> If I was a player I would have so much more to say
16:48:34 <DoT`> kyza did the equivelant of like a 17 year old tantruming and stamping on someones smartphone becasue they wanted a choclate
16:49:21 <Camail> ...is that a thing a 17 year has done
16:49:25 <DoT`> no
16:49:27 <Camail> isnt that something like.. a 10 year old does
16:49:30 <Camail> or 5
16:49:48 <DoT`> thats why i have such trouble triyng to work out the motive cam
16:49:54 <Phearlock> depends on how the 17 year old is raised probably
16:49:54 <DoT`> its something a 5-10 year old does
16:53:56 <carcinisation> the International Phonetic Alphabet ... was created, naturally, by the French, who needed some way to deal with the fact that four of the five letters in haies (hedges) were silent (its pronounced eh)
16:54:46 <Phearlock> lol
16:54:56 <Phearlock> is that some meme or is it legit?
16:55:15 <skram> i thought you knew all the memes ferlok
16:55:19 <Phearlock> No
16:55:43 <carcinisation> should be legit but you can always try to make it a meme :p
16:55:44 <ZK> eh, in the context of a fantasy world where people actually kill each otehr and bar fights start over much less, i think reacting emotionally is to be expected.
16:56:47 <carcinisation> .roll d20 to boop zk
16:56:50 <ZK> If this were today, that would be a kid's reaction. But I'd say a barbarian would have probably just hit someone if that had happened. In a fantasy roleplay, reactionary roleplaying seems adequate and I don't see how a barbarian would see that as a temper tantrum.
16:57:13 <skram> bro i am wise as fuck
16:57:16 <skram> my stats are all wonky
16:57:18 <ZK> lol
16:58:02 <ZK> i dont see why DoT` doesnt understand that characters in a medieval times would not react the same way as would be expected in  modern society
16:59:13 <carcinisation> aren't barbarians so named as ancient greeks thought anyone not speaking greek just sounded like "bar bar" (blah blah)
17:01:58 <skram> I have more int than dex, ZK.
17:02:02 <ZK> You wrong me, I'll show you you can't just do that. Cause I can wrong you as well. If I don't show them I can defend myself, they'll see me as a doormat and I'm not like that. My times in the woods have shown me that I need to show that I can defend myself, and messing with me is a bad idea. -Kyza
17:02:03 <ZK> lol skram
17:05:31 <ZK> anyhow, wisdom should let you understand that it's normal for a girl that has litterally lived her whole life alone to want to prove she isnt a doormat and that knows actions speak louder than words.

17:06:16 <Cam_phone> Gg
17:06:30 <Cam_phone> Dunno how long this will lat
17:08:16 <Cam_phone> Zk fantasy worlds are not lawless, this one is actually pretty civilized. You just happen to be adventurers that seek danger. Conflict through violence with other community members is still not good
17:08:25 <Cam_phone> Unless you are in a weird barb town
17:08:56 <Cam_phone> Idc if thats how your character reacts or not but
17:09:20 <Cam_phone> It isnt by any means a universally assumed reaction
17:09:27 <ZK> i mean, i wasnt violent on her, i attacked her crossbow because she tried to trick me. For Kyza, that's how she shows she aint a doormat that can be tricked with stupid tricks.
17:09:45 <ZK> Especially with someone that shot her a few hours ago
17:09:58 <Cam_phone> yea thats fine
17:10:12 <Cam_phone> But you said if you saw the dagger you would attack her
17:10:45 <Cam_phone> Which is a thing you can do, but you cant justify that with an appeal to the fantasy culture
17:11:04 <Cam_phone> You couldve always just sent mynu to jail and left her there
17:11:06 <ZK> oh yea, probly not. It's mostly at DoT` saying he doesnt understand why a character would attack the crossbow and that being a 5 year old reaction and being a temper tantrum
17:11:27 <Cam_phone> Oh no it was still childish as fuck
