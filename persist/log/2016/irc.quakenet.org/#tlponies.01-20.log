00:04:04 <reification> night all
00:49:03 <motbob> if you were going to teach a programming class over the internet, how would you do it
01:12:14 <Biopone> Probably have slides, and annotate over them
01:12:38 <Biopone> Then switch to examole code, ect

01:33:35 <BioSC> took an online programming class like that
01:33:39 <BioSC> I think I did well in it
01:33:41 <BioSC> was a long time ago
01:45:00 <Camail> slides are a good base line, but having the person use a virtual chalk board as well is very useful

18:17:54 <skram> dab
18:18:49 <skram> I pushed grifts last night but I decided to stop after like 38 because i popped the passive that makes me not die when i drop to 0 like 3 times
18:19:13 <DuB> :P
18:19:25 <DuB> I got 60 last night, was scary.
18:19:43 <DuB> I finished off the boss while it was on cooldown still. >.>
18:19:49 <DuB> Scaryscary.
18:20:10 <DuB> That's why firebird is nice, you get two!
18:20:15 <skram> Im missing only a few pieces for my late game build though
18:20:20 <DuB> It's just not as good as other builds.
18:20:28 <DuB> Gotta farm!
18:20:31 <skram> :D
18:20:48 <skram> I really like sunwoko because the money gem is actually a part of the build
18:20:51 <skram> gotta go fast
18:21:48 <DuB> I did not know that. :O
18:21:52 <DuB> Huh.
18:22:47 <skram> Well only sort of. Movement speed is important so it works out well and extra money is always nice. However, grifts dont drop gold
18:23:15 <skram> Sunwoko is only a entry level build anyway, but I can do rifts really really fast so I use that to farm gear
18:23:57 <DuB> Sounds fun. xD
18:24:07 <DuB> There's a wizard flashfarm t10 build that also uses it. http://www.diablofans.com/builds/70681-flash-fire-wizard-t10-speed
18:24:28 <DuB> With goldwrap for basically infinite armor as you turn yourself into a permanent explosion.
18:25:18 <skram> lol
18:25:21 <skram> this is amazing
18:26:03 <DuB> The firebird bits of that aren't really needed - you can replace with sage's for double deathbreaths.
18:26:08 <DuB> Or other utilitystuff.
