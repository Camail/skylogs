15:54:41 <ZK> or a flying trout companion

15:54:46 <ZK> i think that's gonna be the base
15:54:51 <Dot> what a familier that would make
15:55:13 <ZK> trout has a healing spel
15:55:21 <Dot> does it have wings or more jsust kind of swim in the air?
15:55:24 <ZK> it needs to be in touch proximity
15:55:28 <ZK> swim in air
