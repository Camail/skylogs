21:25:34 <Camail> dot
21:25:39 <Camail> pls
21:25:41 <Dot`> cam
21:25:44 <Camail> PLS
21:25:50 <Dot`> no DnD drives me to this cam
21:26:17 <Camail> no dnd is what keeps me sane
21:26:20 <ZK> so you should host some dnd Dot`
21:26:24 <ZK> dm it
21:26:28 <ZK> ill play
21:27:55 <Camail> if i DM again the game is gonna be twice as slow
21:28:04 <Camail> fuck those xp pacing guides
21:29:41 <ZK> im still aiming to make dot work and create a game
21:30:04 <Camail> i was try to cater to using the mechanics as satisfaction
21:30:13 <Camail> which is what videogames do
21:30:19 <Camail> thats not what i do
21:32:56 <ZK> ive been playing some dungeon world, where the system is basically: If you fail, you gain xp. it works pretty well, with people that fail enjoy geting closer to a level up. lvl doesn't matter that much in that game anyhow
21:33:15 <Camail> and its much more time consuming to make mechanics satisfying because they are much more abstract, narratives are simple and much easier to make
21:33:38 <Camail> which is why there are more modules than board games
21:34:05 <Camail> i couldnt care less about which system i use
21:34:08 <Camail> thats entirely my point
21:34:19 <Camail> a different game system does not solve my problems
21:34:23 <Camail> not even a little bit
21:35:23 <Camail> I don't need mechanical reenforcement for my players thats the wrong focus i need
21:35:48 <Camail> I just need to be me and tell a good story, I can do that.
21:36:05 <Camail> if people are invested in the story they invest in their characters, and then they can ejnoy it
21:36:29 <Camail> if i need to give xp for failures or give inspiration for success, I've failed
21:36:59 <Camail> that doesnt mean i think less of DMs who like using mechanics, but I've grown to despise using them
21:37:09 <ZK> oh, that's not what that's about though. You just don't mind failing, but that isn't the purpose of the system. The game also removes intitiative, which is amazing for narrative combats
21:37:58 <Camail> i disagree, i dont tihnk initiative matters
21:38:04 <Camail> combat narration is totally fine
21:38:11 <Camail> i dont think eiter one ahs an advantage
21:39:24 <Camail> I am mostly actively distancing myself from caring about this kinda of conversation, I mean no offense at all. But the very idea of being itnerested in how the mechanics impact the narrative. That's not what I should be thinking about at all right now
21:39:40 <ZK> That's fine, I only commented, didn't really want to start a conversation on it
21:39:51 <ZK> We've had a few, and they never lead anywhere anyhow
21:40:24 <Camail> we ahv very different preferences in table top games
21:40:54 <ZK> yep, that's fine. I love narration based, I believe game systems inherently change how the game is played, and what the DM can do with it
21:41:17 <ZK> You believe game mechanics don't affect it, but you can correct me if I'm misinterpreting you
21:41:47 <Camail> well, thats what I'm feeling right now
21:41:53 <Camail> my beliefs have changed a lot, being new to DMing
21:42:04 <Camail> well, more like its what I want to do
21:42:23 <Camail> I want to ignore the gamer urges that pull me as a player
21:42:42 <Camail> because that's ultimately what made me not want to create during our campaign

23:01:48 <motbob> I am interning with a Minnesota judge. She asked about my hobbies. One thing led to another and she ended up watching some videos on my Youtube channel.
23:02:21 <Camail> what is her opinion of leffen
23:02:50 <motbob> She didn't watch that video
23:03:13 <motbob> "You have some serious fans" -- her after reading people happy that I was making videos again
23:03:48 <Camail> did you stop because school
23:04:03 <motbob> no I stopped because of no #passion
23:04:18 <Camail> ah, yea #passion is hard to find sometimes
23:04:54 <Camail> oh, did you ever solve the riddle of why streams are shit? or was that project inconclusive
23:05:55 <motbob> no, I've got no way of reaching a conclusion without a powerful computer that can stream in high quality for testing
23:06:29 <motbob> i watch games where 3.5Mb is fine (Melee) so I haven't really thought about it
23:07:23 <Camail> hooray for old games
23:07:41 <motbob> if only new games were in 4:3
23:08:10 <Camail> yes, then we could really feel the hellfires on our feet
23:08:48 <motbob> i don't get it
23:09:44 <Camail> because widescreen is awesome
23:12:55 <motbob> man. a full 25% of the screen for dedicated #productionvalue
23:13:13 <motbob> wow
23:13:17 <motbob> i just thought of something
23:13:33 <motbob> but it's stupid so never mind
23:14:37 <Camail> in any first person game its quite important
23:15:19 <motbob> sorta
23:15:33 <motbob> it's mostly important in the context that everyone else is playing in widescreen
23:16:06 <motbob> but if widescreen weren't an option, it wouldn't be any bigger of an issue competitively than a FOV cap
23:16:25 <Camail> high fov looks very bad
23:16:34 <Camail> also it changes how you aim
23:16:39 <Camail> in any game
23:19:42 <ZK> some old sc2 pros used to stay on 4:3 cause they were used to that
23:19:53 <Camail> many cs pros do as well
23:20:00 <Camail> and there's videos of them getting fucked by a flank
23:20:03 <Camail> cuz they didnt see it
23:20:15 <Camail> didnt matter if the other person used 4:3 or not
23:20:33 <Camail> so the aspect ratio objectively changed gameplay despite what everyone else is using
23:21:21 <motbob> i mean yes it changes gameplay but not in a way that can't be accounted for
23:22:22 <Camail> I don't consider stream #productionvalue very important , so that gets instantly trumped by pretty much anthing
23:23:13 <Camail> the reason melee doesnt care about the bit rate is cuz it has 5 polygons per character, the aspect ratio doesn't really do much
23:24:01 <Camail> after all these games are meant to be played on a screen, you are using a screen to play the steam. I think any change in aspect ratio for general monitor/tv use will be adopted by everyone else
23:24:07 <Camail> stream*
23:24:38 <Camail> that's not really what i initially want to say, I was being way more petty
23:24:44 <Camail> i just don't like 4:3 anymore
23:25:01 <Camail> which means its bad, because yes
23:26:08 <motbob> i mean you have 75% of the screen moving instead of 100%, that's like upping the bitrate by 33%
23:27:08 <Camail> but that would never happen because black bars are ugly, and they are only covered up for streaming purposes
23:27:14 <Camail> just shrink the capture of the game
23:27:18 <Camail> which they arleady do
23:27:25 <motbob> what?
23:27:32 <Camail> like
23:27:40 <Camail> well, some do
23:27:49 <Camail> many dont i forgot about that for a second
23:28:13 -!- Micen_ [~micen@h45.60.190.173.dynamic.ip.windstream.net] has joined #tlponies
23:28:15 <Camail> but if you really wanted to have black space around the game you could just shrink it in OBS
23:28:19 <Camail> and upt stuff on the sides
23:28:23 <Camail> put*
23:29:09 <motbob> yuk tbh
23:29:45 <Camail> you can arrange it in various ways
23:29:52 <motbob> in my head i'm trying to imagine what interesting stuff you could put in the borders of a shrunk 16:9 game in a 16:9 stream
23:29:54 <Camail> you'd never get banner-style black bars on just the sides
23:30:08 <Camail> but i cant imagine there are 0 ways to compose it well
23:30:23 <Camail> black bars on the sides and the top
23:30:29 <Camail> int he fgc it would work
23:30:36 <Camail> put names and scores up top near the health
23:30:48 <Camail> and the name of the event upt here as well isntead of in the bottom middle
23:30:52 <motbob> idk
23:31:05 <Camail> but why is that worse than huge black bars ont he sides being filled up
23:31:42 <motbob> because it's not any better than just putting it on the top. the information fitts nicely up there, whether it's smash 4 or sf5
23:31:58 <motbob> you can fullscreen the feed and overlay the info on top of it. Why shrink it?
23:32:14 <motbob> if you have insufficient bandwidth at that point, decrease the res of the stream entirely
23:32:29 <motbob> in a 4:3 stream you can fit playercams and such
23:32:48 <motbob> playercams don't fit elegantly anywhere on a shrunk 16:9 feed
23:32:48 <Camail> in any 4:3 stream
23:32:50 <Camail> or melee
23:33:00 <motbob> well they did it in brood war recently
23:33:06 <motbob> playercams on the side
23:33:11 <Camail> the common thread is that allt hese games look bad already
23:33:18 <motbob> i think melee looks fine
23:33:26 <motbob> actually I think BW looks fine too
23:33:32 <Camail> there is no extra detail to show
23:33:33 <motbob> i think they both look better than, say, sf4
23:33:58 <Camail> I feel like there's a heavy bias
23:34:11 <motbob> i love sf5 and think it looks better than either game
23:34:54 <Camail> melee has charm, but its part of the "we havent figured out how to do 3d yet" of early games
23:35:13 <Camail> i think its aged poorl, not as bad as games 5 years older, but not well
23:35:30 <Camail> i do love melee yea, but i would never say i enjoyed the way it looked
23:35:55 <Camail> but thats preference, not really part of the issue
23:36:06 <Camail> neither BW or melee have a high level of detail, which is what costs resources
23:36:39 <Camail> something like guilty gear Xrd will not be streamed well no matter what you do
23:36:55 <Camail> because its the best looking game out there
23:37:39 <Camail> isnt there a new codex
23:37:41 <motbob> good looks aren't necessarily equal to high motion
23:37:55 <motbob> example 1: wind waker
23:38:05 <Camail> exactly
23:38:10 <motbob> example 2: any sprite fighter
23:38:16 <Camail> which is why i pointed out the looking good isn't the issues
23:38:27 <Camail> I changed it back to high level of detail
23:38:42 <Camail> which excludes cell shading and spritework, even though sprites can actually be pretty damn elaborate
23:38:46 <motbob> well you promptly... well never mind
23:39:06 <Camail> that was a side comment, forgive me for the minor error
23:39:38 <Camail> it doesn't take much to admit that it was an accidental contradiction
23:40:18 <motbob> i have a disorder that means that I can only read half of what other people write
23:41:09 <motbob> i mean it's not even detail
23:41:50 <motbob> if there were a detailed static background, that would be way better than the shifting backgrounds we get in sf5
23:42:12 <motbob> i think the moonlit stage or w/e is the worst offender. Pretty sure the background has fog that moves
23:42:26 <Camail> at least there isnt a foreground
23:42:30 <Camail> that was a thing in third strike
23:43:06 <Camail> they banned training stage in tournaments
23:43:11 <Camail> because its a boring static stage
23:43:15 <Camail> like, capcom banned it
23:43:21 <Camail> because its boring
23:43:26 <Camail> so i dunno
23:43:28 <motbob> i agree
23:43:33 <Camail> I lvoe trianing stage because its not annoying
23:43:56 <Camail> the backgrounds in sf5  are awful for a number of reasons
23:44:02 <Camail> primarily because they move in 30 fps
23:44:10 <Camail> so they are supper distracting on any moving stages
23:44:16 <motbob> anyway at the end of the day i did find one stream that looked good
23:44:23 <motbob> so it's possible
23:44:35 <Camail> thats good
23:44:44 <Camail> the current situation has a lot of intertia
23:44:46 <motbob> we can say it's not sf5's fault, but every streamer's fault (but one)
23:45:00 <Camail> pretty much
23:45:14 <Camail> it all came from people who just wanted to show othe people video games
23:45:24 <Camail>  lots of bad habits are institutionalized now
23:45:37 <Camail> food time
23:45:38 <Camail> good talk
