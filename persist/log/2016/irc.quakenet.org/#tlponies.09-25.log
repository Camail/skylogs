07:34:46 <Dot`> \o/ art
07:35:22 <Micen> im in a really good mood. and then when i get sick and tired of not being able to do what i want on my computer, go back to that Cadance piece that ive been working on. 
07:35:38 <Micen> i had to transfer it to new paper like 3 times because i kept going too dark. 
07:35:50 <Micen> well should say too saturated with the coat. 
07:36:05 <Micen> looked more like Pinkie Pie...
07:36:15 <Dot`> haha
07:36:34 <Micen> but i finally hit the right balance and need to start on the hair.

21:34:14 <skram> I had SEVERAL german classes you know.
21:34:59 <reification> i had zero german classes owing to the stupid way my school did languages
21:35:26 <reification> literally spent more time studying swedish!
21:36:27 <skram> There were no mandatory language classes when I went to school, so I changed to shop class
21:36:49 <skram> Which was basically me and some friends fucking around for a few hours each week. Far better use of my time!
