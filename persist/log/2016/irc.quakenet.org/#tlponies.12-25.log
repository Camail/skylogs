18:21:39 <Rawr|Fone> The most expensive one probably
18:32:59 <motbob> the video cards that are $150-$200 have been the best power/value since the beginning of the millenium
18:33:06 <motbob> power/money*
18:33:20 <motbob> so i would start looking in that range if I were looking for a new card

18:49:42 <Dot`> 1080 is nice skram
18:49:44 <Dot`> :)
19:07:39 <Dot`> pon pon
19:09:15 <ZK> oh yea, the 1070 and 1080 are amaaaaaaaazing
19:14:22 <Crisium> GTX 1080 > GTX 1070 > RX 480 = GTX 1060 > RX 470
19:14:29 <Crisium> get best you can afford
19:14:55 <ZK> and which cpu mobo Crisium
19:14:58 <ZK> also, merry xmas Crisium
19:15:24 <Crisium> i have no idea what mobo, but for cpu probably i7 6700k
19:15:58 <ZK> an i7? But that'll take money away from getting a better gpu :o
19:15:58 <Crisium> you can get i5 6600k and probably be fine, but some games really like hyperthreading
19:16:23 <ZK> wait, since when do games do hyperthreading? I thoguht most didn't do that
19:16:31 <Crisium> CPUs last a lot longer than GPUs, so imo its better to get a more expensive CPU and keep it for 5 years
19:16:44 <Crisium> battlefield games like it
19:16:48 <Crisium> but it depends
19:17:35 <ZK> yea, i just did quick check, most games don't seem to use hyperthreading
19:17:47 <ZK> but yea, battlefield would make sense
19:19:25 <ZK> so i'd say i5, since i7 is basically an i5 with hyperthreading, not worth the upgrade unless you do rendering or somethin
19:19:32 <Crisium> but consider people keep CPUs for 5-6 years+ these days
19:19:45 <Crisium> the extra $100 turns out to $160-$20 more a year
19:19:50 <Crisium> sorry $16-$20*
19:20:08 <Crisium> GPU upgrades tend to be 2-3 years, but you can stretch them i guess
19:21:47 <ZK> eh, my i5-3500k will last forever, hyperthreading still not relevant, that was 4 years ago
19:22:24 <ZK> i really doubt any game makers will ever try to adapt their games for hyperthreading, except a select few
19:22:36 -!- Golly [~Golly@1.92-221-121.customer.lyse.net] has joined #tlponies
19:22:56 <ZK> the 100$ really ain't worth it, since it won't future proof as the cpu speed is pretty much the same
19:23:20 <Crisium> depends on the overall budget i guess
19:23:31 <Crisium> i5 + 1070 is better than i7 + 480/1060
19:23:43 <ZK> oh yea definitely, but if you can't afford the 1080, stick to i5 is my recommendation
19:23:57 <ZK> only go to i7 if you can already get 1080
19:25:18 <Crisium> http://www.hardware.fr/getgraphimg.php?id=223&n=19 http://www.hardware.fr/getgraphimg.php?id=223&n=20 http://www.hardware.fr/getgraphimg.php?id=223&n=18
19:25:33 <Crisium> for RTS games i7 can provide a noticable benefit
19:26:25 <Crisium> or watch dogs lol http://www.hardware.fr/getgraphimg.php?id=223&n=17
19:26:28 <Crisium> huge difference
19:27:30 <ZK> now compare having the i7 with having the 1070 over 1080 though :P
19:28:20 <Crisium> the idea though is that the i7 can last through 2 GPUs, possibly 3
19:28:35 <ZK> the i5 will do the same basically
19:28:53 <Dot`> skram, input on budget please
19:28:58 <ZK> if 6 frames is what matters, the gpu will bring it back right away
19:28:58 <Crisium> it wont have that somtimes 10-20% i just linked
19:29:08 <Crisium> GPU and CPU bottlenecks are different though
19:29:37 <ZK> gpu > cpu as soon as you get a decent cpu for gaming
19:30:01 <Crisium> with mobo + cpu + ram tending to last 5-6+, i think a strong foundation that can last 2-3 GPUs is wise
19:30:02 <ZK> heck, you could get the FX-8370 and still be fine for 5 years
19:30:05 <Crisium> no
19:30:24 <ZK> ram can be transferred, it's mobo+cpu combo
19:30:39 <Crisium> a strong RAM foundation is important too
19:30:52 <Crisium> do not underestimate bandwidth: http://www.techspot.com/articles-info/1171/bench/Fallout.png
19:31:13 <ZK> not worht the cost investment over good gpy
19:32:19 <Crisium> id take i7 + 1070 + faster ram over i5 +1080 + slower ram, personally
19:32:56 <Crisium> but what is the budget skram 
19:32:58 <Crisium> lol
19:33:06 <Crisium> maybe he'll get a Titan X Pascal
19:33:06 <ZK> yea, not me at all. 1080 can still last 5 years and be fiiine
19:33:14 <Crisium> thats a poor strategy
19:33:40 <Crisium> 1070, sell in 2 years, + 2170 (or whatever) will be better for the long term
19:33:44 <Crisium> imo
19:34:06 <ZK> future proofing computers is like future proofing cars: In the end, you'll still have to change. And each GPU being 400+ isn't easy to replace
19:34:18 <Crisium> *sell in 2 years
19:35:10 <Crisium> consider someone who went $330 GTX 970, sold it for $200, and then bought $380 1070.  compare this to someone who bought GTX 980 for $550 and is running it into the ground today (did not buy 1070/1080)
19:36:49 <ZK> yea, but then im lazy, and i dont have to put in the effort to replace it with 980 which is still amazing :P

19:37:04 <ZK> if i had a 980, holy cow would i be happy
19:38:08 <Crisium> but if you had the 970 youd have 86% the speed for 2 years, and 135% the speed today, and with the resell it would cost the same, possibly less
19:38:34 <Crisium> then when you updrade AGAIN, the 1070 will fetch much more than the 980 in 2-3 years from today
19:39:02 <Crisium> i advocate buying the best only if you intend to stick with the best, so 980-1080 is fine if you have the wallet
19:39:04 <ZK> <- lazy
19:39:24 <ZK> i dont want to open up my computer, meet people to sell parts, ship it, etc.
19:39:40 <Crisium> lazy tax :P
19:39:41 <ZK> but yea, i see your point
19:40:00 <ZK> upgrading constantly is probably better, but i know i wont do that
