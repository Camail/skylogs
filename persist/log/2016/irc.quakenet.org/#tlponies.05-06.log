19:55:42 <Camail> they wont put it in the smae palce

19:56:50 <DuB`> Not the first I've seen.
19:56:52 <DuB`> Second! ;D
19:56:54 <Camail> you have to start at ep 39, the beginning of this arc
19:57:07 <DuB`> Which ep is this?
19:57:09 <DuB`> They're long. >.>
19:57:13 <Camail> or else you lose almost all the meaning

20:02:21 <Camail> skram  apparently in 5e equipping a shield takes 1 standard action
20:02:37 <Camail> so you cant switch to it easily like you would a weapon

20:10:14 <skram> that sucks cam
20:10:26 <skram> dub you should watch all of it honestly

20:38:08 <Camail> oh aso you dont need to be a spell caster to use the wand of magic missiles, its no longer a universal rule
20:38:18 <Camail> there are some though that do, at higher rarities
20:38:40 <ZK> so, we could give it to the bard?
20:38:48 <ZK> actually, no.
20:38:54 <ZK> let's not give it to the bard
20:38:56 <Phearlock> lol
20:39:01 <skram> good plan
20:39:33 <Camail> honestly giving it to venessa is still the best at the moment

20:51:16 <DoT`> im going D2
21:03:29 <DoT|Phone> bio
21:04:40 <Phearlock> There's 2 options dot, either he hasn't seen the pic yet and isn't dead.
21:04:43 <Phearlock> or he has and is dead.
21:07:26 <Camail> also phear either both sentinel and shield master are really good feats, especially  sentinel though because your attacks of opportunity are really good
21:07:45 <Camail> honestly looking through the feats most of thme are pretty meh
21:08:08 <Phearlock> I don't get all that many attacks of opportunity though
21:08:22 <Phearlock> Enemies generally don't move away from melee
21:08:25 <Camail> sentinel gives you more
21:08:28 <Camail> from more things
21:08:37 <Camail> if someone near you attacks anything but you, get an aoo
21:08:47 <Camail> if something disengages, you still get an aoo
21:09:09 <Camail> if you hit with an aoo, their speed for that turn is no 0
21:09:16 <Camail> so they dont get to move out of your range
21:09:18 <Phearlock> I'll consider it when feat time is upon us.
21:09:37 <Camail> yea I'm more stating that its a cool feat
21:09:49 <Camail> those two, save attacker, sharpshooter, maybe one or two more
21:11:11 <Camail> but the rest are pretty meh
21:11:16 <Camail> or extremely situational
21:13:17 <Phearlock> I do think sentinel is really good. But shield mastery seems a lot lot more fun
21:13:46 <Phearlock> as it's a thing I can do. While the other one is still sorta just up to you on when it triggers.
21:14:25 <ZK> hey cam, if i have an attack that pushes enemies 10 feet away, would that give phear an attack of opportunity as they move away?
21:14:36 <Camail> yea, i was just purely going by the numbers because corso is crazy tanky
21:14:36 <Phearlock> no that's a push, forced movement
21:14:41 <Camail> ZK  no
21:14:45 <Camail> forced movement does no provoke
21:14:48 <ZK> ah well
21:14:57 <ZK> ill charm them and make em scared of me
21:15:32 <DoT|Phone> cam and I where looking into that yesterday actually zk
21:15:42 <Phearlock> Speaking of dnd, when do people want to do the next one?
21:15:52 <Phearlock> Next week I have no idea what I end up doing
21:15:56 <ZK> cam needs at least till weekend ot prepare
21:16:01 <Phearlock> That's good
21:16:18 <Phearlock> I potentially might get more part-time work and might get different hours at the one I currently have so.
21:16:38 <Phearlock> I'm very "I have no idea what my schedule will look like" right now.
21:17:40 <Phearlock> Probably won't have much effect on dnds as long as I know aprox when it'll be a few days in advance
21:30:35 <Camail> between saturday and sunday next week who can make it? I cant recall if I'm doing anything, but those are our first options
21:31:26 <Camail> and while that should always be the first dates we look at, I don't think we should put dnd as an overall priority, if you have other stuff to do on a weekend then do it
21:31:48 <DoT|Phone> I can choose which day I am busy. so either is fine for me
21:33:46 <Phearlock> 100% can make sunday next week
21:33:56 <Phearlock> 90% can make saturday
21:34:10 <Camail> DoT|Phone  surprise dnd both days
21:34:16 <Camail> 20 hour session
21:34:20 <Camail> gogogo
21:35:01 <DoT|Phone> all hippo encounters
21:35:24 <ZK> Saturday is generally better for me, Sunday I'd be a few hours late
21:35:29 <Camail> 1 hippo is considered easy vs 5 lvl 3 characters
21:35:33 <Camail> but 2 hippos are deadly
21:35:36 <Camail> sigh

21:47:15 <Camail> dot another option for your monk is to get a finesse weapon that counts as a monk weapon and take defensive duelist if you want ac

21:50:16 <DuB`> ???
21:50:56 <Camail> also I'm looking into the details of monks and how unarmed strikes work
21:51:23 <Camail> like, if you have a versatile weapon you can choose to do the d8 damage, then you still trigger the bonus action unarmed strike
21:51:38 <Camail> I dont believe it costs any action to switch between two handed and one handed
21:51:42 <Camail> especially if ur profficient
21:55:40 <Camail> yea dot I'm 100% you can attack using 1d8 with the spear and still have your monk stuff happen
22:03:16 <DoT`> When you use the Attack action with an unarmed
22:03:16 <DoT`> strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make
22:03:16 <DoT`> one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
22:03:41 <DoT`> monk w eapons, which are shortswords and any simple
22:03:42 <DoT`> melee weapons that donâ€™t have the two-handed or
22:03:42 <DoT`> heavy property.
22:04:17 <Camail> correct
22:04:23 <Camail> spear does not have either of those proerties
22:04:27 <Camail> it has the versatile property
22:04:56 <Camail> it is a fundamentally different property
22:04:58 <ZK> like a dagger!
22:05:07 <ZK> which is what makes a dagger so neat!
22:05:08 <Camail> daggers arent versatile
22:05:13 <Camail> they are finesse
22:05:16 <ZK> oh ops
22:05:29 <Camail> which ironically would be god for dot
22:05:33 <Camail> he's the only one who can use a dagger well
22:05:35 <ZK> shhh
22:05:36 <Phearlock> Do you need 2 hands to hold your dagger ZK?
22:05:41 <ZK> nope
22:05:42 <Camail> but instead you guys just let your only magic item go to waste
22:05:46 <ZK> i can hold two daggers in two hands
22:05:50 <Camail> because you guys are boring
22:05:58 <ZK> cause we arent min maxing
22:06:09 <Camail> thats not min maxing lol
22:06:18 <ZK> strategizing to have most effective team?
22:06:19 <ZK> plz
22:06:38 <ZK> let the magic items go to waste
22:06:40 <Camail> not the most effective
22:06:43 <Camail> more effective than 0
22:06:50 <Camail> you can do w/e you want
22:06:52 <ZK> which would also be the most effective
22:06:52 <Camail> I'm jnot a player
22:07:14 <ZK> it's a great pickle cutter
22:07:19 <Camail> I can personally think its dumb without making a call as a dm
22:07:22 <ZK> far more effective than 0
22:07:46 <Camail> I could've change the weapon type if i wanted to avoid this
22:08:05 <ZK> im very hapy
22:08:11 <ZK> and i did actually use the dagger to attack once
22:08:22 <Camail> when
22:08:25 <ZK> i missed
22:08:33 <Camail> when tho
22:08:35 <ZK> two sessions ago?
22:08:49 <Camail> like, what fight
22:09:01 <ZK> i dont remember fights o.o
22:09:03 <Camail> everyone makes a shit ton of attacks i cant remember every one
22:09:14 <ZK> We had a shit ton of fights i dont remember every one
22:09:15 <Camail> i enver remembered you getting into melee
22:09:19 <ZK> yea, once
22:09:23 <Camail> you've had like 10 fights
22:09:30 <ZK> i cant even remember names
22:09:34 <ZK> and you expect me to remember fights
22:09:36 <ZK> gosh
22:10:45 <Camail> you also misremember things, which is why i was asking in the first place to try and help corroborate evidence
22:12:47 <ZK> i did try using it once for sure
22:13:03 <ZK> cause i rememebr pressing dagger+1 on my char sheet
22:25:40 <Camail> DoT`  i think the thing about versatile weapons is that, in order to use the versatile damage die you must have a free hand to make the 2handed attack
22:26:02 <Camail> also there are multiple other abilities for other classes than say "weapon must either be twoh anded or versatile"
22:26:12 <Camail> which means that if it isnt speicfically prohibited, its fair game
22:26:32 <Camail> this is less about min maxxing and more about understanding what the keywords mean in the world
22:27:08 <Camail> versatile weapons are the kinds that are designed in such a way that switching between 1h and 2h are extremely easy
22:27:15 <Camail> thats why there are only a handful of them
22:36:39 <Camail> the only thing you possibly (possibly, under interpreation) is the ability to throw a projectile back fi you deflect a missile and reduce the damage to 0
22:36:53 <Camail> so you lose the opportunity to spend a ki point to do a ranged attack sometimes
22:37:44 <DoT`> at this poit that is alomost definit waste of ki though
22:37:46 <DoT`> so eh
22:38:55 <Camail> so yea, theres almost no downside to using the d78
22:38:57 <Camail> d8*
22:40:54 <Camail> you do have quite a few options for lvl 4, is a way away but i dont want you to feel like you dont have options because you dont have great rolls where you want them
22:42:23 <Camail> the other downside to using your spear is that you now need to get close, instead of having more range
22:43:51 <carcinisation> night all
22:46:30 <ZK> gnite sleepyhead
22:46:46 <DoT`> gnight reif <3
22:46:46 <Camail> luck is also a pretty good feat, 3 times per long rest you essentially decide if something you do has advantage or if an attack against you has disadvantage
22:48:36 <Phearlock> yeah luck seems really good as a general feat
22:49:06 <Camail> savage attack + frenzied range looks strong as fuck
22:49:17 <Camail> rage*
22:50:11 <Camail> also is it me or does intimidating presence kinda suck
22:55:19 <Phearlock> yeah it does seem kinda bluh camail
22:55:53 <Camail> I might think about hoembrewing it to make it interesting because it seems really bad, and not just because bardum has -2 cha
22:56:08 <Camail> like...why charisma? because its indimidation?
22:56:14 <Camail> that doesnt make much sense lore-wise
22:56:37 <Camail> you're a raging barbarian who can barely tell friend from foe, why would you be using charisma 
23:25:17 <Camail> strength seems more relevant
23:26:26 <Camail> maybe make it a bonus action but with a range of 20ft
23:26:36 <ZK> yay homebrew!
23:28:00 <Camail> yea I like that for now
23:28:49 <Camail> mabe 15 feet, i dunno
23:28:59 <ZK> oh yea, for next sessions, is it possible to have inspiration come more into play? 
23:29:13 <Camail> ehhhh
23:29:45 <ZK> I mean, it's a feature of 5e :P
23:29:53 <Camail> a variant feature
23:30:08 <Camail> under the complete disgression of the dm
23:30:17 <Camail> I still want to use it
23:30:29 <Camail> but given how good it is i dont want to give it out that much
23:30:56 <ZK> I would think like say a situation where Bardum explains why he knows that rock so fucking well, and roleplays it, you could give him inspiration for that roll or something
23:31:15 <Camail> ehhhhhh
23:31:33 <Bio> pan
23:31:39 <Camail> that seems like a pretty low bar for a +d6 on any attack,check, or saving throw
23:31:49 <Camail> that doesnt expire
23:32:01 <Bio> stack inspires 
23:32:05 <Bio> 5evr
23:32:10 <ZK> isnt inspiration where you get advantage on a roll?
23:32:19 <ZK> cause that's how I've always played it
23:32:30 <Camail> in hindsight I wouldn't give you inspiration for RPing ignorance again, but it was early and i want to encourage rp as a thing
23:32:34 <Camail> oh right
23:32:37 <Camail> thats even stronger
23:33:14 <Camail> if its cool or clever I will
23:33:43 <Camail> but honestly nothing has struck me as being either, sorry
23:33:48 <Camail> maybe mynu giving you the dagger
23:33:54 <Camail> but i forgot about inspiration at the time
23:33:57 <ZK> that's kind of out of character though, no?
23:34:04 <Camail> its cahracter devlopment
23:34:09 <ZK> Hmm, true
23:34:24 <Camail> and in-party reconciliation
23:34:33 <Camail> which are both important and worthy of reward
23:34:35 <Camail> but i forgot
23:37:20 <ZK> I dunno, I really like the idea of the mechanic. Rewarding players for doing stuff in character, even though it could be the suboptimal thing to do.
23:37:48 <DoT`> dorf tux doesnt inspire you?
23:37:50 <DoT`> :P
23:38:34 <ZK> I've played some games where DM was really generous with it, and it was a lot of fun, cause we didnt hoard them and just tried to express our characters as much as possible, and getting incited to do that
23:39:15 <Camail> any time you guys expose an interesting side of your character, think of a cool way to approach a battle or a combat situation in the middle of a battle, discover some key evidence, stuff like that
23:39:15 <Camail> I want inspiration to be a meaningful reward that's earned rather than just another mechanic you can try and gain like currency

23:47:07 <DoT`> cane http://www.deviantart.com/art/Tidal-Wave-607416835
23:47:14 <ZK> Thing with inspiration is though that you cant gain it like currency, since you can only have one at a time. By having only 1, you won't ever use it until you find the perfect moment, a bit like items in JRPGs. I guess I really like the mechanic cause it's the basis of Fate and really helps develop character since you're encouraged to roleplay as much as possible sicne you often get rewarded 
23:47:14 <ZK> for doing that.

23:49:33 <ZK> sorcerers mean in bloodline, rihgt?
23:49:56 <Camail> i dunno, all i looked at was if they needed a spellbook
23:50:48 <Camail> also i know you like the fate system but dnd isnt balanced for the fate system and I'm not experienced enough to create good encounters that take that into account
23:51:01 <Camail> thats just a practical concern
23:51:15 <Camail> I'm still dont want to give it out
23:52:03 <ZK> Is there a way to weaken it, just to have a way to encourage more personality from characters in combats or the likes?
23:52:12 <Camail> your concerns are noted and I will make sure to be aware of inspiraiton now, but ultimately i dunno
23:52:27 <ZK> Say like the monk going head in to the fight, that could have gotten something for being so stupid, but at the same time, it was character development for sure
23:52:38 <Camail> was it tho
23:52:44 <ZK> getting killed by those skellies was hilarious, and maybe from now on he'll be scared of doing that
23:52:54 <ZK> and that's character development
23:53:16 <Camail> maybe if its made explicit
23:53:25 <ZK> or would encourage him to do it further in the future
23:53:28 <Camail> but a. thats hard for me to actually tell if he just makes a change to the way he fights
23:53:52 <CockRoach|42> before i left the bar earlier, pengu was placed 2nd and 2-2
23:54:01 <Camail> and b. when would he get the inspiration? when he almost dies? when he officially makes it a habit to be more cautious
23:54:10 <Camail> unless he explcitly says something then no
23:54:18 <Camail> also you and i both agreed that fate only works for strong players
23:54:29 <Camail> and most of us are new to our jobs
23:54:48 <skram> dot has been a halfling all his life
23:54:50 <ZK> Yes, but it reinforces players to become better at all points by putting rewards for good roleplaying
23:54:51 <skram> so he has experience
23:55:05 <Camail> I'll think about it
23:55:27 <ZK> Sure, doesn't need to be inspiration, but anything that encourages people to roleplay is awesome to me
23:55:30 <Camail> I'm going to be blunt and say I won't be giving it out as freely as you're going to want
23:56:12 <ZK> I was mostly expecting maybe once or twice per session or the likes
23:56:16 <Camail> RP born out of the desire for in-game advantage leaves a shitty taste in my mouth
23:56:27 <Camail> its just such a direct reward, no subtelty if you give it like you want me to
23:56:42 <Camail> twice per person per session?
23:56:46 <ZK> fuck no
23:56:47 <ZK> too much
23:56:52 <ZK> two per session
23:56:54 <ZK> total
23:57:09 <DoT`> can none of you math?! i should have easly been fine , then planned to disengage next round...
23:57:38 <Camail> with rolls like these, i dont need to math
23:58:02 <DoT`> well besides you cam, who also agreed that it should have probably worked
23:58:08 <ZK> And i mean, if it's no subtelity, just don't give it. If it's DoT` advancing like that, you can say that's so dumb, i want to encourage you to be courageous like that.
23:58:24 <ZK> as an example, not saying DoT` deserved anything there
23:59:06 <Camail> ok so hear is my thought:
23:59:31 <Camail> at the end of a session I go back through everything and reward between 0-2 inspiration for the next session
23:59:37 <Camail> most likely just 1
