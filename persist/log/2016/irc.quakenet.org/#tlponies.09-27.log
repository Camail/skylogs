13:17:16 <Dot`> good dump
13:17:59 <Runbunny> indeed.
13:18:20 <Runbunny> the yes in the first one is too good O:
13:24:32 <Dot`> did you see skram?
13:24:42 <skram> of course
13:35:58 <Rawr|Phone> Everyone should go play battlerite
13:36:05 <Rawr|Phone> So we can play when I get home
13:36:32 <Dot`> golly, didnt you say you had 2 keys?
13:36:52 <Golly> yea, if i can find them
13:36:53 <Golly> sec
13:37:24 <Dot`> rawr might hunt me down if i dont ask for one
13:37:50 <Rawr|Phone> I will
13:39:54 <Golly> im supposed to get keys, but the mail i received is confusing
13:40:16 <skram> whats battlerite
13:40:51 <reification> a game rawr has and we don‚Äôt
13:41:20 <reification> http://store.steampowered.com/app/504370
13:41:24 <Rawr|Phone> It's bloodline champions 2
13:41:30 <skram> this just looks like bloodline champions
13:41:35 <Rawr|Phone> But with more than 40 people online
13:41:38 <Dot`> basicly
13:42:02 <Rawr|Phone> It's the same studio, some heroes are also the same
13:42:13 <Rawr|Phone> But they removed most of the bad things
13:42:24 <skram> i remain sceptical
13:43:16 <Rawr|Phone> You shouldn't
13:44:06 <Runbunny> Idk...
13:44:25 <Dot`> well its dling rawr
13:44:39 <Dot`> .roll d20 to boop golly
13:44:42 <Runbunny> bloodline champions was explained to me as world of warcraft arena just more skill. 
13:44:53 <Runbunny> and I hate wow arena.
13:44:54 <reification> stream it dot so we can see if it‚Äôs any good :p
13:45:03 <skram> nah
13:45:07 <Dot`> it might be, i wont be
13:45:23 <skram> its more like LoL without items and just brawling instead
13:45:58 <Runbunny> So it's heroes of the storm?
13:46:16 <Golly> except theres actual skill involved
13:46:39 <skram> something like that
14:06:20 <Rawr|Phone> If you think of it as a team fight in lol you are missing a big part of how complex it is

14:22:01 <Phearlock> Hey
14:22:12 <reification> have you read seveneves?
14:22:51 <Phearlock> I have not
14:23:13 <Phearlock> wiki'ing it, looks cool
14:23:29 <reification> i thought it might suit you giving is largely space engineering fiction
14:23:56 <Phearlock> I like all sorts of sci-fi, but yeah, seems cool
14:24:15 <reification> i really enjoyed it, especially the first 2/3 or so
14:24:39 <Micen|Droid> I need to read more sci fi. I consume most of mine through tv. 
14:26:13 <Phearlock> anything in particular you're looking for? I got everything from pony fanfics to old stuff
14:26:35 <Micen|Droid> Hmm. Not sure. Last scifi I read was Bio of a Space Tyrant.
14:26:40 <Micen|Droid> Which is hard to top
14:27:03 <Micen|Droid> And uh... Apprentice adept series. 
14:27:54 <Dot`> MICEN
14:27:58 <Dot`> went for shower
14:27:58 <reification> oh seveneves appears to be getting made into a movie, so you could wait for that micen
14:28:03 <Micen|Droid> Dot! 
14:28:06 <Micen|Droid> http://sta.sh/01loy7i9ofq9
14:28:12 <Micen|Droid> Finally did it
14:28:15 <Micen|Droid> I finally did it. 
14:28:32 <Dot`> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
14:28:39 <Dot`> hahaha
14:28:46 <reification> clam down dot
14:28:46 <Micen|Droid> Zecora, balancing in the middle of a pond with a cup of coffee
14:29:10 <Micen|Droid> On one hoof
14:29:27 <Micen|Droid> I think that was everything, right? 
14:29:45 <CockRoach|42> Micen|Droid: <3
14:29:58 <Dot`> well considerign the full tihng took like 3 minutes just to say by the time we finished...
14:29:58 <reification> very nicely done
14:30:41 <Dot`> wha is there was the proper original idea :P
14:31:16 <Micen|Droid> I feel weird creating on a schedule. 
14:31:26 <Micen|Droid> I should link it to blue as well 
14:31:27 <Dot`> forced creativness is hard
14:31:46 <Dot`> its why my art always stops as soon as i decide to get better and set a plan
14:32:08 <Micen|Droid> Accept its not. It creates a time where my creative juices get flowing. 
14:32:19 <Micen|Droid> I had no plan. Then came out with thay
14:32:24 <Micen|Droid> That*
14:33:59 <CockRoach|42> 00:18 < Micen> [06:07.16] <Micen> Zecora, balancing on one hoof, on her head,drinking a cup of tea in the everfree forest,  while Twilight watches on.
14:34:12 <Micen|Droid> Anyway Phear, got any recommendations along those lines? 
14:34:21 <Micen|Droid> Shit. Forgot pirplesmurt
14:34:31 <CockRoach|42> she's so easily forgotten
14:34:34 <CockRoach|42> it doesn't matter
14:34:41 <Micen|Droid> Only second best pony. 
14:34:55 <CockRoach|42> best pone or go home
14:35:26 <Micen|Droid> Youre right. I should draw best pony. 
14:35:38 <Micen|Droid> Sunset Shimmer
14:36:13 <Phearlock> If you want a chill old one, Ringworld maybe
14:36:24 <Phearlock> Exploration-y sci-fi
14:38:03 <Phearlock> If I could be a bit critical of your arts um.
14:38:14 <Phearlock> How on earth is she balancing?
14:38:18 <Phearlock> Her center of mass is like
14:38:40 <Phearlock> nowhere near in-line with the thing she's balancing on xD
14:38:41 <Micen|Droid> Zebra magic. 
14:38:48 <Phearlock> =D
14:38:58 <Micen|Droid> Hooves also dont bend that way
14:39:32 <Micen|Droid> Zebras also dont drink from cups or live in that kind of biome. 
14:39:48 <Micen|Droid> The plant life is also most likely wrong as well. 
14:39:56 <Phearlock> eh, thats fine
14:40:12 <Dot`> well micen, time to draw zecora in the savanah
14:40:22 <Micen|Droid> Mostly zecora is balanicing so dot...
14:40:26 <Micen|Droid> Damnit dot! 
14:40:30 <Dot`> haha
14:40:49 <Phearlock> Although Micen, if you do like science & sort-of-magic mixed...
14:40:51 <Phearlock> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/6515/days-of-wasp-and-spider
14:40:52 <Phearlock> pony
14:40:59 <Micen|Droid> Ohh 
14:41:09 <Phearlock> This is legit really good though
14:41:10 <Micen|Droid> I do like me some  of that
14:41:42 <Phearlock> Sadly not "finished" since it's a 3 story story, and it's currently I think 2/3 done with story 2
14:41:49 <Phearlock> but hey this bit is finished and really good
14:42:02 <Micen|Droid> Even better! Something to look forward to
14:42:41 <Micen|Droid> Now what I was happy with in that was how the little white reflective bits came out. 
14:42:58 <Phearlock> Ye it looks like paper
14:43:05 <Micen|Droid> I found my white gel pen and finally got to use it
14:43:54 <Micen|Droid> I heard mixed things about the quality. I might get a silver one next so its not so paper white.

19:49:37 <Camail> politics are so fucking boring
19:50:30 <Camail> for the first time in this entire election cycle I'm trying to have an informed opinion and there is nothing to think about, nothing to actually make me work
19:51:16 <Camail> it's just...learning who is lying and who isn't lying at any given time. which is either really easy or literally impossible.
19:51:44 <Camail> i guess its stimulating for journalist who enjoy the puzzle of finding information, but not for me
