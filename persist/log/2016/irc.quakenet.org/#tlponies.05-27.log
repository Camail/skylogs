14:53:44 <DoT`> it has tilesets that are really good

14:54:25 <DoT`> ooo Orcs where added as a playable race this week
14:54:33 <DoT`> i thought the vote was for human :/
14:54:51 <DoT`> i want to play a human fort near necromancer towers
15:05:58 <Runbunny> O:
15:06:04 <Runbunny> I don't know what that entails.
15:06:11 <DoT`> death
15:06:36 <DoT`> humans dont live underground so everything must be built on th surface
15:06:47 <DoT`> need walls and houses and stuff
15:07:04 <DoT`> so a lot more to build and a lot more unsafe
15:08:30 <DoT`> if only you pons didnt require flashy graphics for games
15:08:37 <Runbunny> I was certain that DWARF fortress was about Dwarves.
15:09:00 <Runbunny> I never said I did.
15:09:21 <DoT`> until the gloriuos Meph decended and blessed us with the MASTERWORK mod
15:09:40 <Runbunny> I am just not certain that I am emotionally commited to dwarves.
15:09:42 <DoT`> then we got many new races, items, workshops, enemies and fps!

16:23:21 * skram slaps DuB` around a bit with a large trout
16:23:22 <DoT`> camail, zkś charm spell, i see there is a charmed effect under condistion(page 290), would it not cause that rather than the way we used it? 
16:23:29 <skram> do you know what time it is dub
16:24:44 <Camail> no dot
16:24:50 <Camail> the spell does not say they are charmed
16:25:00 <Camail> it says what it does
16:25:13 <DoT`> ok, i thought so, was just curious
16:25:31 <Camail> hmmmm
16:26:04 <Camail> also i dont understand
16:26:11 <Camail> we did use the charm condition
16:26:13 <Camail> the exact way
16:26:24 <DoT`> this says you get advantage on social rolls
16:26:29 <DoT`> he could just ask and get awnsers
16:26:35 <Camail> the caster would, yes
16:26:37 <DoT`> i dont recall him rolling
16:26:39 <Camail> which he did 
16:26:48 <Camail> who
16:26:50 <Camail> what context
16:27:05 <Camail> kyza didnt make any social rolls
16:27:47 <DoT`> oh wait, she did, i recalled wrong, when she starting making up stories she did
16:27:57 <DoT`> you had her roll deception
16:28:02 <DoT`> and i think you gave advantage
16:28:30 <DoT`> that entire charm person went weird
16:28:33 <Camail> yes
16:28:45 <Camail> she had adv on deception rolls
16:28:49 <Camail> but she had to make a bunch
16:28:54 <Camail> because everthing she said was a blatant lie
16:28:58 <DoT`> there wasnt really any questions asked, just makin gup stories
16:29:03 <Camail> a blatant, past changing lie
16:29:30 <Camail> and regardless
16:29:37 <Camail> rules dont matter for games that happened
16:29:46 <DoT`> but if for instance she had just asked, where is your boss, would that have been a social check, or would he have just said?
16:29:56 <Camail> we live and learn
16:30:13 <Camail> depends ont he person
16:30:20 <DoT`> im not trying to retcon, or so wedid wrong, it was just the only example i have to use 
16:30:30 <DoT`> to ask questions
16:30:32 <DoT`> in context
16:30:51 <Camail> I can't really answer that question tho
16:30:53 <reification> finland.mkv https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Viwwetf0gU
16:31:01 <Camail> these are things you have to try and see if they work
16:31:18 <DoT`> my question is relating to the rule, not the question i used
16:31:43 <DoT`> but ok, i think i get how it works
16:32:01 <DoT`> some questions under the effect of charm will require a roll otherse wont
16:32:33 <Camail> if it would require a social role, that person ahs advantage
16:32:54 <Camail> the quality of the question determines the DC, and the context does as well
16:33:09 <Camail> there are some people who simply do not tell anyone anything
16:33:22 <Camail> there are others that use information as currency
16:33:36 <Camail> depending on the person you talk to, charm person does different things
16:34:58 <Camail> charm is a very simple condition, like most of them, leaving 90% of the interactions up to the context and dm decisions

19:42:09 <Phearlock> hey ponpons <3
19:45:19 <CockRoach|42> hi Phearlock
19:46:34 <Phearlock> Also I'd like to say this fic just completed http://www.fimfiction.net/story/264005/the-twilight-enigma
19:46:38 <Phearlock> and it's really awesome
19:46:55 <Phearlock> With airships, pirates, twilight sparkle
19:46:57 <Phearlock> and other nice things
19:47:20 <CockRoach|42> so many fics i should read
19:49:20 <Phearlock> yeah I was feeling bluh earlier and just didn't want to play any games
19:49:22 <Phearlock> or go outside
19:49:44 <Phearlock> or do anything, so I dug out some fanfics again, and that was really what I needed to get back to usual cheerfulness
19:49:47 <CockRoach|42> i've slept for four hours
19:50:04 <Phearlock> aw
19:50:12 <Phearlock> you ok?
19:50:41 <CockRoach|42> except for sore muscles caused by a massage, yes
19:51:04 <CockRoach|42> i am a very tired man on fridays
19:54:11 <Camail> i wonder if overwatch has something like vac
19:54:18 <Camail> where any change of files will fuck you
19:58:15 <skram> probably
19:58:37 <skram> i tried starting overwatch with fraps running and got some error message about third party programs and astuff
20:00:27 <Camail> obs > fraps
20:00:39 <Runbunny> There were that reddit thread were one guy was accused of aimbotting. 
20:00:49 <skram> no camail
20:00:56 <Camail> which was actually not an aimbot
20:00:58 <Camail> the mcree
20:01:05 <Camail> yes skram
20:01:10 <skram> obs is wonky as fuck with overwatch
20:01:18 <Camail> just desktop capture
20:01:21 <Camail> ez
20:01:33 <skram> fraps does the one thing i want to do better than obs
20:02:17 <Camail> isnt it way more resource intensive tho
20:02:38 <skram> dont think so
20:03:02 <skram> wasnt able to screen capture at 60 fps in potato quality without killing my computer
20:03:39 <skram> though the drawback with fraps is that a 15 second file at 60 fps is 2gb
20:04:59 <DuB`> ... waow.
20:21:04 <DuB`> skram Runbunny - again soon or a more extended break? :)
20:21:38 <Runbunny> I can play. I only have 1½ hours till I have to sleeps.
20:21:40 <Camail> is this an orgy
20:21:43 <Runbunny> I have work tomorrow.
20:21:58 <Runbunny> You want in Cummail?
20:28:25 <skram> my body is ready DuB`
20:28:53 <DuB`> Oh good.
20:32:27 <Camail> stop having sex around the children pls
20:32:42 <Runbunny> around or with?
20:33:09 <Camail> Phearlock  i got the pillars of eternity dlc, so far its pretty fun. not that far into it though
20:33:17 <Camail> their version of multiclassing is kinda shit tho
20:33:28 <Camail> its almost never worth taking another classes thing
20:34:09 <Phearlock> Thats about the same thing I heard from other sources
20:34:36 <Camail> berzerk, skeletons, sneak attack
20:34:42 <Camail> those are the only interesting ones i've seen
20:35:04 <Camail> skeletons are goof for squishies to protect them and tie up engagements
20:35:08 <Camail> good*
20:35:17 <Camail> but thats like, the only really nifty thing I've thought of
20:36:20 <Camail> BioWork  matt colville put out another campaign video
20:36:33 <Camail> so thats something to look forward to
20:37:16 <Camail> I took my character generation from him but i dont think i like it, causes too many problems without solutions other than "reroll"
20:37:41 <Camail> having amazing characters is as bad as having poor characters
20:37:55 <Camail> but making someone reroll a really good char is shitty
20:38:32 <Camail> so there's just a blatant unfixable flaw
20:39:04 <Camail> using the randomized matrix is probably the best idea
20:39:07 <Camail> maybe
20:39:19 <Camail> dnd is hard
20:43:21 <DoT`> more social was done
20:43:54 <Camail> ew
20:44:49 <DoT`> yes
20:45:41 <DoT`> character gen is hard
20:46:21 <Camail> game design is hard
20:54:53 <Rawr|Fone> I think lotv is the best version of sc2
