17:31:17 <Yolteotl> from april to september, I was working on GUI and it was very cool, then they lost those component, and they put me on old software support.
17:31:54 <Yolteotl> Now, GUI are coming back, but since I'm not in the new software team, they don't want to let me work on what I'm good at it
17:32:27 <Yolteotl> very very very frustrating

17:41:15 <Yolteotl> my manager is a woman
17:41:19 <Phearlock> So they're like actively saying no to you instead of just forgetting what you're good at?
17:41:20 <Yolteotl> she doesn't understand anything
17:41:47 <Yolteotl> she is good at yelling
17:42:00 <Phearlock> So, no?
17:43:18 <Golly> is there someone above her on the totem pole you could talk to?
17:43:20 <Yolteotl> nop, but my team master did 
17:43:42 <Phearlock> Also if you do ping someone above her, dont' lead with "she's a woman, she doesn't understand anything"
17:43:49 <Golly> lol
17:43:57 <Phearlock> That'll land you in the shit with human relations for discimination
