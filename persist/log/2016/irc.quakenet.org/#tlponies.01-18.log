02:59:18 <BioClass> i'm trying to figure out why the hell diablo3 isn't working
03:01:35 <Phearlock> what sort of not working is happening?
03:02:00 <Phearlock> I have no idea how bnet games work in terms of troubleshooting so idk how much help I'd be =/
03:02:28 <BioSC> click play game, game becomes a greyish white screen and i have a large cursor
03:03:17 <BioSC> and their forums are a mess of wierd shit work arounds
03:03:19 <Phearlock> Hmm, is there a config folder or some sort that isn't deleted when you uninstall the game?
03:03:41 <Phearlock> (though god those things could be anywhere)
03:03:46 <BioSC> lol, isk
03:03:47 <BioSC> idk
03:04:11 <Phearlock> That's my usual go-to to reset any settings that might not have been reset on a reinstall
03:05:46 <Phearlock> Like if users/my documents/diablo 3 isn't deleted, try remove anything and everything there that isn't important (I assume all char saves are kept on blizz servers)

03:07:52 <BioSC> only thing in there is a txt file
03:07:59 <BioSC> d3 prefs
03:08:03 <DuB> :O
03:08:17 <Phearlock> Well, remove it
03:08:20 <Phearlock> Imo xD
03:08:23 <DuB> Bio fix pls and join me as HC pro.
03:08:42 <BioSC> fuk me for buying amd amirite
03:09:26 <DuB> :(
03:09:32 <Phearlock> If you suspect it's a graphics card issue could always try downgrade drivers a bit
03:15:01 -!- Yoltphone [~androirc@253.73.126.78.rev.sfr.net] has joined #tlponies
03:16:22 <BioSC> idk
03:16:27 <BioSC> fukin game
03:16:48 <Phearlock> Well if deleting the prefs didn't work, I would try downgrading some drivers.
03:23:58 <BioSC> dont' think i've ever downgraded drivers before
03:27:35 <Phearlock> I'm sure googling "uninstall AMD driver windows -whatever windows-" should return a good result
03:28:03 <Phearlock> then just make sure you have a slightly older one ready to install so you don't have to go browsing for one with intergrated graphics lol
03:32:19 <BioSC> I dont' care that much about d3
03:32:31 <BioSC> its literally the only game thats having an issue
03:32:48 <Phearlock> It's not hard to do, or revert if it does't work. But ok
03:33:27 <zkay> enjoy the piracy bio
03:33:52 <BioSC> finally getting around to playing that game
04:00:19 <DuB> Hungrybox melee! :O

04:50:58 * skram slaps DuB around a bit with a large trout
04:51:00 <DuB> Because NA.
04:51:01 <DuB> :P
04:51:09 <DuB> Skram I was top 20 for a day! 
04:51:11 <DuB> Teehee.
04:51:28 <skram> top 20 in BEING THE WORST maybe
04:51:48 <skram> wat class are you duble
04:51:53 <DuB> Wizard, of course!
04:51:57 <DuB> Everytiem.
04:52:21 <skram> Ive played a different class every season
04:52:31 <skram> u casual
04:52:43 <DuB> Kind of nice when you get every cube legendary you need while levelling. >.>
04:53:44 <DuB> There's another guy in liquid who got top 10 for monk HC, we're gonna push some as 2 tomorrow.
04:54:08 <skram> whats your highest gr so far?
04:55:19 <DuB> 51?
04:55:26 <DuB> Still no ancient weapon. :(
04:55:33 <skram> ooh thats pretty good
04:55:41 <DuB> 3 deathwish, no ancient.
04:55:47 <DuB> And still 0 of the arcane orb wand.
04:56:03 <DuB> Meanwhile THREE wohs and two aether walker.
04:56:05 <DuB> ???
04:56:15 <DuB> "Super rare"
04:56:15 <skram> Ive been running rifts all day and I got like one item I need for my build
04:56:34 <DuB> :T
04:56:35 <skram> spent like 2000 blood shards on belt items and i have about 50 saffron wraps?
04:56:43 <DuB> Hahahahahah yep.
04:56:57 <DuB> I got my channeling belt right as I hit 70. >.>
04:57:04 <skram> I dont understand how sunwoko monk build works
04:57:05 <DuB> I feel almost guilty I got so lucky.
04:57:11 <skram> you have all of the spells that use spirit
04:57:17 <DuB> Perfect firebird build in like 1 hour after hitting 70.
04:57:18 <skram> and no spell that generates spirit ??++
04:57:23 <DuB> ??? Hahaha
04:59:08 <skram> I tried solo grift t5 and i popped the passive that makes you not die when you take fatal damage and i spent like 30 seconds on ~1%
04:59:39 <skram> i have SO MUCH life on hit but that requires me to hit shit y'see
05:00:26 <DuB> O_o
05:00:28 <DuB> 2scary
05:00:41 <DuB> I'm loving the free firebird death passive in addition to the normal one.

05:00:57 <DuB> I can basically "die" every thirty seconds.
05:00:58 <skram> So you can asplode TWICE?
05:01:39 <skram> Ive only died as level 70 once in hardcore
05:02:10 <skram> it had full helltooth and it never dropped again so thats when i quit s4
05:02:11 <skram> :p
05:02:29 <DuB> Ouch. >.<
05:03:25 <skram> it says "killed by greed" which is pretty fitting
05:03:33 <DuB> LOL
05:03:43 <DuB> Aaahaha nice.
05:03:53 <skram> SURE WE CAN run the vault on t10 with sub-optimal gear
05:04:02 <skram> its fine they said
05:05:14 <DuB> Teehee.
05:05:18 <DuB> I'm kinda confused.
05:05:44 <DuB> On the D3 reddit LITERALLY 100% of comments on firebirds are about how it's bugged and useless.
05:06:06 <DuB> But I'm already comfortable farming T8-10 and don't even have an ancient weapon and a ton of bad rolls.
05:06:53 <skram> Are you telling me that the internet might be wrong
05:07:38 <DuB> Collaboratively, somehow.
05:08:09 <DuB> I AM excited to do the melee dmo arcane orb stuff, though.
05:08:13 <DuB> Hypuu
05:08:23 <skram> Maybe you accidentally unlocked the secret to firebird
05:08:41 <skram> Im kinda bummed that they nerfed the healmonk build so hard that its basically useless though
05:09:47 <DuB> Aw. :(
05:10:04 <DuB> Didn't a korean 4man just get grift 100 the other day with a healmonk, though?
05:10:42 <skram> No idea
05:11:13 <DuB> http://www.diablofans.com/forums/diablo-iii-general-forums/diablo-iii-general-discussion/143680-grift-tier-100-is-closed-in-korea
05:11:37 <DuB> Mostly I'm just overjoyed that I don't have to play archon anymore.
05:14:58 <skram> what paragon level are you dubles
05:15:12 <DuB> 240something.
05:15:38 <skram> 240 in this season?
05:15:43 <DuB> Yeah.
05:15:48 <skram> dang son
05:15:49 <DuB> High grifts boost it really fast.
05:16:03 <DuB> Like, 5+ per.
05:16:27 <skram> dats pretty good
05:16:48 <skram> I dont even have gear to go beyond t5 yet

06:50:51 <Micen_> it may be, but no horse canibalism!

15:34:25 <ZK> reset all my logs, set network to dynamic instead of static ip
15:34:35 <ZK> speed up to 20mb/s from 4
15:35:28 <DoT`> weird
15:35:45 <ZK> hmmm, nope at 14. Still not completeley fixed i guess
15:37:00 <ZK> i tried playing a game of sc2 this morning, response time was so horrid
15:37:16 <DoT`> with even 4 mb there shoould be no issue
15:37:45 <DoT`> canada makes no sense
15:38:04 <ZK> its lag spikes mostly
15:38:10 <ZK> or whatever
15:38:38 <DoT`> have you tried a diffrent modem/router
15:39:03 <ZK> ive tried connecting my laptop to the same cord. I get perfect internet
15:39:19 <DoT`> you try a netweork card for your pc?
15:39:34 <DoT`> could be the onboard is faulty
15:39:46 <DoT`> and i assume you reinstalled all the drivers for it by now
15:39:55 <ZK> my graphics card too big,  it takes the spot i would need to put in the network card t.t
15:40:00 <DoT`> :/
15:41:40 <DoT`> have you tried a usb to ethernet adapter. I have never even seen one in use, but i know they exist
15:44:13 <ZK> nope. I wish i could find out what the problem was...
15:44:30 <DoT`> it souds to be either faulty hardware or a bad driver
15:44:32 <ZK> I feel like best would probly to just reinstall windows
15:44:43 <DoT`> as you have tested everything else
15:45:20 <ZK> knda
15:45:36 <ZK> well i mean, internet goes through, so could that be bad hardware?
15:45:37 <ZK> maybe i guess
15:46:58 <DoT`> well if you had a laptop plugged in to the exact cable and it worked that means everything but the stuff after there works
15:47:03 <DoT`> only 2 things left
15:47:38 <DoT`> well, there are more, but they are all highly unlikly

15:52:16 <DoT`> you have dled the right driver and are not just using the generic one right zk?
15:55:46 <ZK> well, i let the computer find it
15:56:20 <DoT`> it should have done it right, but find your motherboards model and hunt down the right one again just incase
15:56:42 <ZK> oh no win10 driver
15:58:33 <Micen> ZK, your win7 driver should be compatable

16:00:36 <DoT`> uninstall the netweork driver
16:00:39 <DoT`> reinstall

18:40:20 <Cane> X-Plane's scenery generation is just the dumbest thing.
18:40:38 <Phearlock> haha that's great.
18:40:46 <Phearlock> I have seen some stuff
18:41:14 <Phearlock> the classic is ofc putting tall buildings in cities and towns that are above a certain population number
18:41:25 <Phearlock> even thoguh they really don't have anything tall at all
18:42:02 <Cane> Oh yeah it does that.
18:42:14 <Cane> The autogen is so silly in X-Plane. It's really unfortunate.
18:42:20 <Cane> And it almost never has airports at all, just runways.
18:42:31 <Cane> Gotta get that expensive OrbX scenery obviously.
18:42:38 <Cane> The one that costs more than the simulator.
18:43:19 <Phearlock> heh, yeah.
18:44:10 <Cane> Also, my rudder pedals died.
18:44:23 <Phearlock> Oh no D=
18:44:25 <Cane> Because MadCatz/Saitek.
18:44:50 <Cane> Flight sim gear is so hard to find in Norway too.
18:44:59 <Cane> Especially now that the main online shop has closed down.
18:45:03 <Phearlock> yeah
18:45:46 <Phearlock> I usually just search on price-compare sites for them
18:46:01 <Phearlock> Not to like, try get the best price but like, to find obsucre people who have it stocked.
18:46:46 <Cane> That's what I did, but every single rudder pedal was out.
18:47:03 <Cane> Prisjakt, Prisguide, etc. had tons of entries for every pedal but they were all sold out.
18:47:05 <Cane> So was amazon.co.uk
18:47:09 <Cane> Which, what? How?
18:47:37 <Cane> I eventually found them on some Danish site that shipped here.
18:48:03 <Cane> Sigh, I'm getting Crosswinds eventually though.
