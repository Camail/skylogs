04:47:50 <Camail> we bonded over strife
04:47:58 <Camail> at the shittiest hotel food service ever
04:48:19 <ZK> strife?
04:48:24 <Camail> remember
04:48:27 <Camail> when we ordered  apizza
04:48:31 <Camail> and they fuckin forgot aobut us
04:48:33 <Camail> for an hour
04:48:40 <ZK> oh righhhhhhhhhtttttttt
04:48:44 <ZK> well, it happens
04:48:47 <Camail> STRIFE
05:08:15 <Camail> dub go to sleep
05:08:26 <ZK> but dub has no one to stop him from playing forever
05:08:45 <ZK> wait, why does he get a week off now√â
05:08:48 <Camail> he stops himself all the time
05:09:03 <ZK> im about to start my exams, and he has a break to play games?
05:09:06 <ZK> i thought he was at school
05:09:24 <Camail> probably has 2 weeks before exams
05:15:37 <ZK> can i hate him for that?
05:17:29 <Camail> you can hate him without even having a reason
05:17:33 <Camail> thats the best part of hate
05:17:54 <ZK> ooooooooohhhhhh
05:18:46 <ZK> is it the same for love?
05:20:54 <Camail> nah, love isn't real
05:21:06 <ZK> what about like
05:27:28 <Camail> i think the only real emotion might be hate
05:30:32 <ZK> what about when i kiss you? Isn't that disgust?
05:32:57 <Camail> no just a lot more hate
05:34:08 <ZK> so is eating pizza hate? or just neutral expression for survival?
05:35:09 <Camail> its some hate
05:35:12 <Camail> but a different flavor
05:35:16 <Camail> people get confused
05:35:37 <ZK> im very confused
05:35:43 <ZK> i should kiss you to understand more
05:36:31 <Camail> too far away
05:36:36 <Camail> just think about it for a bit
05:36:39 <Camail> that's good enough
