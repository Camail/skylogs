05:28:54 <BioPhone> Tomorrow I can
05:46:17 <motbob> camail, i found out that hearthstone's card restriction thingy doesn't affect my deck at all
05:46:36 <motbob> the only thing it changes is that I don't have to deal with a bunch of annoying cards
05:46:49 <Camail> thats good
05:47:01 <Camail> will it actually be playable tho
05:47:40 <Camail> wouldn't it just...lose to decks with low cost cards, tho?
05:48:01 <Camail> mill in magic makes sense because it has a graveyard
05:49:35 <motbob> well druid has a card that is 1 cost and kills any minion, but the opponent draws 2 cards
05:50:13 <motbob> so if you have (1) two of that card, (2) a bunch of control, and (3) no card draw, you can usually outlast your opponent to the end
05:50:36 <motbob> and then you have at least a 6 card "lead", usually, when fatigue sets in
05:50:58 <motbob> there's also a druid card that lets both players draw a card. that accellerates it.
05:51:43 <motbob> the deck's basically just control spells and cost-effective minions. I just beat a hunter because I used my minions better
06:05:14 <Camail> ah, interesting
06:05:29 <Camail> how much does it care about match ups

09:14:13 <Micen> I have never really felt awake from caffeine, just jittery.
09:14:27 <Micen> and it was the taste of bad coffeee that woke me up when i was younger.
