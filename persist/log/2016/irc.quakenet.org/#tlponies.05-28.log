04:33:40 <Phearlock> https://youtu.be/4jEz03Z8azc Man I could rewatch this all day
04:45:37 <motbob> what's the point of first burn, I wonder
04:47:59 <Camail> VR and first stage landings
04:48:02 <Camail> we future now
04:51:38 <DuB`> That is so cooool.
04:53:40 <Phearlock> First burn is to slow it down right before it hits the atmosphere I believe.
04:55:48 <motbob> it all look so simple in that video
04:55:55 <motbob> rocket goes up, rocket comes down
04:56:11 <motbob> how hard could it be, really, to have it comes down in a specific place
04:56:21 <motbob> (pretty hard)
04:57:07 <Phearlock> i like how you can see the grid fin on the left catch fire for a second at 0:15 right before the quick white-out.
04:57:30 <Phearlock> Even with the reentry burn to slow it down
05:05:54 <Camail> DuB`  y u here
05:05:58 <Camail> .tell dub` pls
05:06:04 <DuB`> Wat!
05:06:07 <Camail> pls
05:06:08 <DuB`> Why!
05:06:12 <Camail> you need rest
05:06:17 <Camail> gotta be sharp for tomorrow
05:06:24 <DuB`> Hmmm.
05:06:31 <DuB`> Normal time?
05:07:03 <Camail> i dont know, i thought we agreed on the later time again but i cant remember now
05:07:09 <Camail> i should use the scheduler on roll20
05:07:19 <Camail> that would be good in hindsight
05:07:27 <Camail> w/e
05:07:32 <Camail> we'll start when everyone is there

23:00:56 <DoT`> gngiht angel!
23:03:45 <Camail> man over the last 2 hours I've had to resist the insanely strong urge to just delete the fucking campaign
23:03:48 <Camail> and it hasnt gone away
23:04:26 <DoT`> why cam? what has happend?
23:04:35 <Camail> i ahvent had fun in a month is why
23:05:30 <Camail> I can handle not wanting to play, but I have a weird personality quirk where I start burning bridges
23:05:53 <DoT`> well if it counts we haev been having fun
23:05:55 <Camail> and maybe if i vent here it will prevent me from deleting everything I've made
23:06:21 <Camail> the fact that you've had fun is the reason i didnt quit 3 sessions ago
23:08:00 <DoT`> like if its somethin we as players are doing wrong, please say, like if its something I do that rubs you the wrong way, we can talk np
23:08:16 <DoT`> i wouldnt like it to be one of us that causes you to give up the campaghn
23:08:26 <Camail> that's not it at all, its nothing that I feel like anyone has any control over
23:08:28 <Camail> only me
23:08:46 <Camail> like, you can't change who you are, what your strengths are, or how you play games
23:08:52 <Camail> that would be pointless to change any of that
23:08:55 <Camail> thats who you are as people
23:09:08 <Camail> thats like me asking you to have a my kind of fun
23:09:12 <Camail> thats not how these things work
23:09:17 <Phearlock> We can try keep things in mind to try make it more fun for you though. Cause it's important that you have fun too.
23:09:46 <DoT`> well if for instance someone is being too picky on rules, you can ask for that to not be done, that kind of thing
23:09:55 <Camail> but you are already trying really hard, its not about you guys, you guys are dong the best you can
23:10:08 <Camail> you know exactly what i enjoy, and what you enjoy
23:10:18 <Camail> I haven't been hiding any of the things I value from dnd
23:12:13 <DoT`> is it just the actual dming you are not enjoying?
23:12:18 <Camail> i dunno
23:12:23 <Camail> i dont really like this module, tbh
23:12:35 <DoT`> maybe we can try some one shots or somethings
23:12:46 <Camail> I need time tot hink about it
23:12:48 <Camail> and to calm down
23:12:54 <Camail> cant make any decisions today
23:13:35 <Phearlock> Sounds like a good idea
23:13:54 <Camail> its just annoying because i keep coming back tot he module, and i keep remembering that the 2 paragraph backstory i wrote was 100 times more interesting than this
23:14:03 <Camail> like, this module relies entirely on its scale
23:14:05 <DoT`> im also happy to try if you want to make your own campghn
23:14:13 <Camail> its just a bunch of fucking dungeons, then a bunch of harder dungeons
23:14:16 <Camail> then harder dungeons
23:14:31 <Camail> these are just my feelings right now
23:14:49 <Camail> and i hate how slow it is, and i have no idea how to fix it
23:15:01 <Camail> reducing the battle imagery has made me hate combat
23:15:08 <Camail> it sped tihngs up but I refues to do it any longer
23:15:31 <Camail> fuck flanking, makes it more gamey, even thoough i thought it wouldnt
23:15:39 <Camail> its just another mechanic to calculate
23:15:52 <Camail> nothing is working out
23:16:24 <DoT`> combat has spead up a lot now simply because we have gotten use to it
23:16:28 <DoT`> thast really what slowed it down
23:17:05 <Camail> and i have yet to design an encounter that executes in any interesting way
23:17:12 <Camail> which is probably due to shitty party balance
23:17:29 <Camail> its all systematic and its all my problem
23:18:58 <Camail> i know this is kinda how 90% of games go but fuck....i dunno
23:19:11 <Camail> i haven't reached that one glorious moment that I've been trying to find
23:19:23 <Camail> nor have i even come close
23:19:39 <Camail> and the more we focus on the actual plot, the farther away it appears
23:20:41 <Camail> I'm sure I'll calm down
23:20:52 <Camail> ironically vanessa's death is probably affecting me the most
23:21:41 <Camail> the one thing i do know id that I'm putting the game on hiatus because i don't even want the semblance of a deadline
23:21:54 <Camail> just wanna think it through, maybe modify the campaign
23:22:40 <Camail> like, 4 cr 3 should've TPKd you
23:23:04 <Camail> something went wrong, i dont know where
23:23:13 <Camail> but somehow you killed them all
23:23:24 <Camail> with one death
23:23:36 <Camail> and it was a death provoked by you guys
23:23:48 <Camail> i had to go out of the kosher combat rules to do it
23:23:58 <Camail> i have no idea how to approach this party and make any of the game interesting
23:24:38 <Camail> 4 cr 3 monsters with a surprise round, no less
23:24:48 <Camail> i msut be doing something wrong
23:26:39 <Camail> I can't quit, even though the angry juice in my body is telling me to quit it all i know that's not what i really want to do
23:27:45 <Camail> i took my frustrations out on poor baby dreadnought players
23:27:52 <Camail> they dont deserve this kind of ass whooping
23:29:28 <carcinisation> night all
