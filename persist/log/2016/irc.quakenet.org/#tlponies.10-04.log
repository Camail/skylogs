01:04:27 <Camail> oh shit
01:04:31 <Camail> stardew 1.1 is out
01:04:37 <Camail> time to read the patch notes
01:04:41 <Camail> probably not gonna play
01:04:46 <Camail> will wait for multiplayer
01:05:30 <Camail> lol, new building that's just... a building
01:05:37 <Camail> no longer gotta build farms to put kegs in
01:05:56 <Camail> shame, i liked raising kegs and watching them grow up
01:06:19 <Camail> new quality rating above gold
01:07:22 <Camail> VOID MAYONNAISE FINALLY
01:07:51 <Bio> lel
01:08:29 <DoT`> i still dont really get what mp will be,  you can visit other farms
01:09:11 <Camail> motbob  oh shit there were plant nerfs
01:09:18 <Camail> all that time crunching numbers, ruined.
01:09:26 <DoT`> oh dear
01:09:30 <motbob> i still have the excel spreadsheet
01:09:41 <DoT`> but if its a proper excel it will auto calc!
01:09:54 <motbob> i can re-crunch for when multiplayer rolls around
01:10:11 <Camail> parsnips werent nerfed
01:10:17 <DoT`> yay
01:10:17 <Camail> so there's that
01:10:36 <Camail> ancient fruit was nerfed a ton, which doesn't even matter
01:10:57 <Camail> by the time that you are growing mainly ancient fruit you dont care about money
01:12:03 <motbob> DIVORCE!
01:12:12 <DoT`> oh no D:
01:12:31 <Camail> "Your baby should now be properly born, even if you pass out in the mines on the eve of the birth."
01:13:11 <Camail> adventures gave your baby a birth defect lul
01:13:22 <DoT`> lol
01:13:27 <motbob> cranberries nerfed makes no sense
01:13:49 <motbob> well i guess it makes some sense
01:14:13 <motbob> blueberries deserved a nerf obviously. basically the uber-fruit

01:15:38 <Camail> hmmm yea i have 0 desire to play this game cuz i did everything
01:15:48 <Camail> well i never got to year 3
01:16:18 <Camail> I became too aware of the vicious circle of gameplay
01:16:58 <Camail> and as it got tighter and tighter because end goals were checked off, everything lost its purpose
01:17:18 <Camail> one mp comes out it might be interesting
01:17:54 <Camail> I sure as hell don't want to restart
01:18:08 <DoT`> i liked the start
01:18:17 <Camail> also the reason this patch took so long is cuz he got burnt out and just stopped working for like 3+ months
01:19:06 <motbob> you mean he spent 3 months rolling in $$$$$$$$$$
01:19:14 <motbob> literally rolling
01:19:17 <Camail> the entire thing was fun, but there's no replayability anymore for me
01:19:22 <Camail> yea probably
01:19:39 <Camail> considering his publishing deal was so hand-off he basically kept WAY more than most people usually do
01:20:02 <Camail> but then he ahd to do all the marketing post-rush stuff himself
01:20:07 <Camail> which caused the burn out
