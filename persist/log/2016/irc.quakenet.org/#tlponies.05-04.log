23:52:18 <Cane> Out of 150.
23:52:39 <Cane> It went SUPER WELL.
23:52:49 <Cane> Phearlaptop was the only survivor again.
23:52:49 <Bio> In mine, there was a berserker about to kill some scrub assault, and you couldn't get into visual range, so I put you into overwatch. the zerker ran up and you crit the damn thing for like 12 or some shit. was awesome
23:53:06 <Cane> Holy shit, how do I even move with balls that big?
23:53:12 <Cane> I must have like no movement points.
23:53:31 <Bio> WHO NEEDS MOVEMENT WHEN YOU HEFF BIG GAHN
23:53:37 <Cane> I guess I'm a better soldier than a commander.
23:53:42 <Cane> Because I keep getting y'all murdered horribly.
