00:00:04 <DoT`> he bought cloths
00:00:14 <Camail> suuuure
00:00:30 <Camail> which tbh arent looking too great
00:01:14 <DuB`> How much xp for lv4...?
00:01:19 <skram> 2700
00:01:38 <skram> 6500 for 5
00:01:43 <DuB`> Aha.
00:01:51 <Camail> you're about halfway to lvl 4
00:01:55 <DuB`> Right.
00:02:10 <skram> im like 2/3 now
00:02:31 <Camail> darb and phar are 1/2
00:02:37 <skram> n00bs
00:03:27 <Camail> the encounter design they have in the module is kinda bland, thinking about just reworking most of it
00:04:35 <Camail> seeing as our party is still new to the non-combat aspects but very familiar with the game-y parts, its a weird balance
00:04:47 <Camail> its like trying to rehab murderhobos
00:04:52 <Camail> but you didnt know you were murderhobos
00:04:53 <skram> lol
00:05:11 <skram> we're just bad at roleplaying
00:06:04 <DuB`> :T
00:22:42 <Camail> everyones bad at everything before they're good
00:23:34 <Camail> its way easier to learn rules than it is to learn how to act/improv
00:24:18 <Camail> my improv is balls, tho i suspect much of it is due to using a module instead of writing it myself
00:25:03 <Camail> I will probably want to take a break halfway through so i can write my own one shots or something
00:25:22 <Camail> I realized it as i accidently wrote a one-shot for corso and venessa's backstory

00:25:59 <Camail> also if we do one shots i can  vary up the party members for who wants to play
00:26:27 <Camail> and then i can get dot to dm
00:26:35 <skram> awesome
00:26:39 <Camail> which i believe he would rather die than DM
00:26:56 <Camail> but there are worse fates than death, so here's hoping
00:27:35 <Camail> I also need to work on my accents, i really really want to do that
00:27:50 <skram> i dont know how to do accents in english
00:27:51 <skram> i mean
00:27:52 <Camail> accents make DMs 100 times better at story telling
00:27:55 <skram> i barely speak english
00:28:15 <DoT`> when skram is dm make sure your character is a young red head and you are safe
00:28:34 <skram> apparently not
00:28:42 <skram> i killed the cutiest patootiest knight
00:28:49 <skram> with reckless attack
00:29:00 <DoT`> should have not been so reckless 
00:29:04 <skram> while raging and cursing and spitting

01:50:46 <Camail> So I'mma just say this, is fun game, play by yourself if you want to
01:50:58 <Camail> getting songs is a bit of a nuisance tho

02:06:40 <Camail> then they had a super close rifle round
02:07:25 <Camail> and now they win off a force

22:05:11 <Yolteotl> 27 to 30° tomorrow
22:05:15 <Yolteotl> beach time : P
22:08:45 <ZK> dub cute
22:09:01 <DoT`> zk, what time tomorow you going to be around?
22:11:02 <ZK> 4 to 5ish i think, so 3 to 4 hours after game time
22:11:52 <DoT`> we where talking about only playinng 4 hours and then starting later
22:12:15 <carcinisation> i surely do skram. but actually the final table bubble practise was very useful too.
22:12:34 <carcinisation> plus i got $1 bounty for knocking out the coach :D
22:13:30 <ZK> oh id like that
22:13:59 <ZK> but then i wouldnt want you guys to skip if i was late
22:15:32 <DoT`> i owuldnt really want to start any later than 9, as then we would finish at 1 which is fine for me
22:15:52 <DoT`> havnt had input form skram or Phearlock
22:16:56 <skram> DuB`
22:16:58 * skram slaps DuB` around a bit with a large trout
22:16:59 * skram slaps DuB` around a bit with a large trout
22:17:00 * skram slaps DuB` around a bit with a large trout
22:17:10 <skram> I dont care DoT`, I lost control of my life a long time ago
22:18:34 <Camail> what time does it usually start for you
22:18:35 <Camail> 7?
22:18:51 <ZK> looking at tlmc 7 maps, i like them
22:18:55 <DoT`> 6
22:18:56 <Phearlock> I told you guys last time. Tomorrow I have work so I'll be home about 1.5-2 hours after our usual starting time.
22:19:23 <DoT`> so 9 would be 3 hours after normal start time
22:19:52 <Camail> zk do you get off of work at 5
22:20:10 <ZK> no, at 3, but we often have to stay a bit later to help clean out
22:20:21 <Camail> east coast right?
22:20:24 <ZK> yep
22:21:05 <Camail> you could probably get in the second half pretty easily
22:21:14 <ZK> thats also good!
22:22:00 <DoT`> the first half at least is probably just going to be trying to find the direction the monastary is in, IF anyone even knows about it
22:22:24 <skram> the first half is me walking back to red larch to check if my tux is ready
22:22:29 <DuB`> Or getting our castle and hippogriffs dealth with. ;D
22:22:37 <DuB`> dealt
22:22:43 <ZK> death :o
22:23:11 <DoT`> wonder if the hippgryphs are still there and if we can use them to get aorund now?
22:23:16 <DoT`> because town is far and im lazy
22:25:14 <ZK> ask skram to talk to birds
22:25:20 <DuB`> ez
