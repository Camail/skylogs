06:10:55 <Camail> wanna duo queue in cazuls?
06:11:31 <DuB`> Shoor.
06:11:41 <Camail> wanna wait until you guys lose or what
06:12:32 <DuB`> Well that's now.
06:12:50 <Camail> k
06:13:07 <Camail> should we discord or not, idc honestly its pretty late
06:13:17 <Camail> mindless murder is fine with me
07:06:06 <DuB`> Actually.
07:06:21 <DuB`> I think I may really have a curse to never do well in a game that you have knowledge of.
07:06:40 <Camail> lul
07:06:59 <Camail> i have 0 expectations
07:07:14 <DuB`> Well.
07:07:15 <Camail> you dont even have 100 hours in the game, idle included
07:07:22 <Camail> and over a long period of time
07:07:44 <DuB`> It's just annoying to top my team in every casual and feel fine and confident.
07:07:56 <DuB`> And then not even make a contribution when I'm actually playing with people.
07:08:07 <DuB`> I dunno why!
07:08:12 <DuB`> Mysterious~
07:08:38 <Camail> I'm the opposite
07:08:44 <Camail> i hate playing with strangers
07:09:27 <Camail> part of it might be that you are killing awful players who feed into bad tendancies
07:09:35 <Camail> and when you play with us those tendencies hurt you
07:09:58 <Camail> movement and momentum and general spacial awareness are completely foreign to you
07:10:05 <Camail> which you dont learn in casuals
07:11:56 <Camail> but its also important to know that patience is important
07:12:06 <Camail> but if you see an opening where you need to be you gotta be there
07:12:40 <Camail> but if you're holding an angle, or you want to punish an aggressive play, patience is key
07:12:51 <Camail> but in situations in cache, where everyone was in b main doing nothing
07:13:02 <Camail> that led to you being pinched on both sides
07:13:25 <Camail> this is different from a 5v5 game where t's might play 2-1-2 in order to stop ct's from getting control through pushes
07:13:43 <Camail> where the 2's on the a nd b wings are stagnant and waiting for pushes in good positions
07:13:55 <Camail> which can take as long as 40 seconds of doing nothing
07:21:38 <Camail> at least to me, nothing is more important than running through the maps by yourself and going through all the angles, being reminded of all the places you can go and hold, where you can move without being seen by specific places, etc.
07:23:17 <DuB`> I need to do more stuff like that.
07:23:24 <DuB`> And just playing with grenades, etc.
07:23:42 <DuB`> For now, zZz.
07:25:02 <Camail> zzz indeed

13:49:02 <Cane> Rawr, be glad you aren't me. I usually wake up in a fucked up position, like arm between my bed and wall and leg on the floor.
13:49:30 <Rawr|Fone> How does that even happen
13:50:14 <Cane> Dreams, I'll bet.
13:55:37 <Rawr|Fone> My dreams have been weird ever since I got tattoos
13:55:48 <Rawr|Fone> They always look different
13:56:50 <Rawr|Fone> Sometimes they are in another spot
13:56:54 <Rawr|Fone> And I'm like
13:57:04 <Rawr|Fone> Oh, I guess I'm dreaming
14:01:56 <Cane> Oh that's fun.
14:03:09 <Cane> I heard if you want to have lucid dreams, buy a watch that has numbers on it and make a habit of looking at it frequently throughout the day. When you go to look at it in your dream, and you can't read the numbers on the dial, you will realize it's a dream and be able to act.
14:03:34 <Cane> Tattoos sound like a more metal way of doing that.

19:27:43 <Cane> I gotta get me a Vive, but it's so freaking expensive outside of the US.
19:28:20 <skrma> I got taxes back so I checked out VR devices, but I would have to buy a new PC first :p
19:28:21 <Cane> Instead of $800 it's like $1053 here. Huge import taxes plus the internet thinking $ = ¬Ä
19:28:49 <skrma> Elkj√∏p is gonna have the Vive on sale some time before summer though, Cane.
19:28:58 <Cane> skrma, is it really?
19:29:09 <Cane> I had no idea. I'll have to ask my local shop to stock them.
19:29:19 <skrma> I got a mail about it
19:29:24 <Cane> Sweet.
