00:12:13 <skram> what team did you bet on bio
00:17:33 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga_Q7pcskkQ
00:17:54 <Camail> i think this might be my favorite meme ever
00:17:59 <Camail> I've always liked them
00:18:04 <Camail> unless they are shittily made
00:18:40 <skram> ?sweden
00:18:42 <Camail> and the skill ceiling is so high for production quality
00:27:23 <DuB`> LIQUIIIIID
00:32:43 <Camail> ikr
00:32:50 <Camail> saw you crmaing ur pants in the tl thread
00:32:53 <Camail> creaming*
00:33:05 <DuB`> Oh man.
00:33:10 <Camail> if vp win, lg wins free
00:33:13 <DuB`> I was in class.
00:33:20 <DuB`> Tabbing between stream and excel.
00:33:26 <DuB`> Trying not to explode.
00:33:34 <Camail> you can stream in excel if you try hard enough
00:34:05 <Camail> tho i dont imagine you would be in that class if you could do that
00:35:55 <Phearlock> DuB`, sunpon https://derpibooru.org/1121405
00:36:03 <Phearlock> and moonpon
00:36:12 <DuB`> Nomnomnom~
00:37:22 <Camail> that naaaaade
00:46:35 <Camail> so sad
00:46:38 <Camail> so so sad
00:46:42 <Camail> the saddest
00:46:47 <Camail> so sad
00:47:11 <skram> so sad
00:47:15 <skram> ITS A SAD SAD SITUATION
00:47:56 <Camail> yea i was thinking that too
00:47:57 <Camail> the ak
00:48:06 <Camail> when he was looking into the box it was fine
00:48:16 <Camail> but as soon as he started checking angles he was fucked
00:48:34 <skram> pretty much
00:49:46 <Camail> this game would be so much worse if the camera was from the middle of the model
00:49:53 <Camail> the fact that it is in the right eye is the best
00:50:07 <Camail> makes some angles so much more important
00:52:42 <skram> apparently im getting about 2000 dollarinos in tax returns this year
00:52:54 <skram> new pc or a statrak doppler bayonet
00:55:34 <Camail> tough choice
00:55:36 <ZK> get a Virtual Reality device!
00:55:41 <Camail> maybe 1k pc and 1k hooker
00:55:55 <ZK> pfft, VR will give you both
00:55:59 <Camail> a 2k pc will last a long ass time
00:56:20 <skram> ive had my 1k pc for like 5 years now
00:56:22 <Camail> we dont have good enough blowjob robots yet, zk
00:56:32 <Camail> or like
00:56:37 <Camail> you can save it if you like money
00:56:48 <ZK> new pc! 
00:56:50 <Camail> oh, 2k in what currency
00:56:52 <ZK> And 4 screens
00:57:13 <Camail> tbf a 1k pc in euros 5 years ago was like a 1.5k usd pc
00:57:40 <skram> in king haralds
00:58:00 <Camail> pls
00:58:23 <ZK> which king harald?
00:58:43 <skram> The fifth, obviously.
00:59:19 <skram> No i spent like 5000 nok 5 years ago which back then was almost 1k dollarinos
00:59:43 <ZK> ohhhhhh
00:59:57 <skram> course i need about 8 nok for a dollar today because of oil prices or something
01:00:06 <ZK> so, basically 2k isnt that much?
01:01:03 <skram> 2k is plenty, even for a reasonably high spec system
01:01:28 <Camail> sill conversions
01:01:31 <Camail> why not just use the usd
01:01:32 <Camail> ez
01:02:34 <skram> because things arent more expensiverer i just need more of it to make a dollarino so if i did convert it id have less buying power
01:02:34 <skram> cam pls

01:04:52 <Camail> no i mean
01:04:56 <Camail> have norway adopt the usd
01:05:40 <skram> well its not my decision but im gonna have to say no
01:06:12 <ZK> yea, should be CAD. American bills suck
01:06:25 <ZK> ours are polymer and cant be ripped, and each is a different color!
01:06:30 <ZK> but plz have american value
01:24:03 <Camail> but also are basically just usless paper now
01:24:59 <ZK> ITS POLYMER, CANT BE PAPER
01:33:05 <skram> cam, know any good webcomics?
01:33:24 <skram> other than gunnerkrigg
01:44:38 <Camail> hmmm
01:44:48 <Camail> erfworld is good
01:45:00 <Camail> the adventures of dr. mcninja
01:45:17 <Camail> fey winds
01:45:33 <Camail> aa's demon, but that's on hiatus
01:45:36 <Camail> ava's*
01:46:07 <Camail> I like Looking for Group
01:46:16 <skram> Oh yeah, avas demon is pretty excellent. Ill check out the rest though
01:47:38 <Camail> shattered starlight is an interesting new comic by the person who does fey winds
01:48:06 <Camail> kinda like a slice of life of a post-magical-girl, i guess?
01:50:42 <Camail> The Meek is good when it actually updates
01:50:44 <ZK> omg, /r/hearthstone has started april fools. Yu-Gi-Oh going strong
01:51:42 <ZK> Webcomics? Ohh I like Sunstone, it's slice of life lesbian bondage

01:55:13 <Camail> sigh
01:57:25 <Camail> I swear I've seen this artist do something that wasn't porn
01:57:29 <Camail> but it's not coming to mind
01:58:11 <skram> dude has a DA with vaguely risque superhero stuff
01:58:24 <Camail> omg did he do that one comic
01:58:30 <Camail> where superman is about to fuck LL
01:58:34 <Camail> and she freaks out
01:58:37 <Camail> i cant check
01:58:39 <skram> haha yes
01:58:40 <Camail> dont have a DA acc anymore
01:58:42 <Camail> OMFG
01:58:50 <Camail> THATS WHERE I REMEMBER HIM FROM
01:58:53 <Camail> ahahaha i knew it
02:01:40 <skram> wait no this isnt the same person
02:01:48 <skram> drawing style is way fuckin similar though lol
02:02:43 <skram> http://nebezial.deviantart.com/art/first-time-is-always-awkward-XD-494768437
02:03:54 <Camail> yes it is the same person
02:04:03 <Camail> that is them
02:04:11 <Camail> nebezial is Stjepan Šejić
02:04:16 <Camail> who does sunstone
02:05:03 <skram> right
02:05:09 <skram> has two DAs then: http://shiniez.deviantart.com/
02:05:22 <skram> which is guess makes sense
02:05:46 <Camail> ahahaha
02:06:22 <ZK> yep
02:07:13 <ZK> fun comics anyhow
02:09:44 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry
02:10:01 <Camail> yea his sense of humor seems great
02:10:13 <Camail> is their a site for it or an rss feed
02:12:38 <Camail> also http://www.seraph-inn.com/
02:12:48 <Camail> has incerloch and phoenix requiem
02:12:53 <Camail> two completed webcomics athat are good
02:13:06 <Camail> inverloch was my favorite for years and years
02:13:17 <Camail> still my favorite nostalgia wise, by far
02:13:31 <Camail> shit, almost 10 years old
02:14:09 <Camail> it has younr artist syndrome
02:14:20 <Camail> where the first 200 pages are...not as good ast the next 500
02:14:26 <skram> hah
02:15:28 <Camail> so does gkc tho
02:16:01 <skram> every long-running webcomic is like that I think
02:16:09 <skram> the first few strips of QC looks like shit
02:16:25 <skram> Except maybe GG
02:17:57 <Camail> qc looked like garbage cans on top of bags of testicles
02:18:08 <Camail> not gonna lie it doesnt look great NOW
02:18:10 <Camail> but its passable
02:18:23 <Camail> especially for a high frequency update cycle
02:18:45 <skram> its entirely acceptable imo
02:19:34 <Camail> the guy who does dr mcninja has done official deadpool comics
02:19:38 <Camail> if that gives you an idea of the tone
02:20:59 <skram> cool beans
02:27:06 <motbob> Hyper Light Drifter is pretty good
02:32:40 <Bio> the fuck?
02:32:46 <Bio> I missed something
02:32:56 <skram> ??
02:32:56 <Bio> how did smithzz have an auto round 5
02:51:57 <Camail> i hope vp win
02:57:56 <Camail> pretty standard
02:58:06 <Camail> but the fact that vp is doing well at all is important
02:58:14 <Camail> if they get pistol its gg
02:58:57 <Camail> yup
02:58:59 <Camail> yupyup
02:59:07 <Camail> yupyupyupyupyup
03:00:08 <Camail> teamspeak pls
03:30:11 <motbob> does Ro8 start tomorrow?
03:32:47 <Camail> err, top 8? if so yes
03:32:53 <Camail> oh right
03:32:54 <Camail> round of 8
03:32:59 <Camail> been awhile since i've heard that term
03:33:38 <Camail> gggggggg
03:33:55 <Camail> nvm
03:35:42 <Bio> yes gg
03:36:06 <Bio> ez 4/4
03:37:27 <Camail> hmm
03:37:58 <Camail> i want to see lg vs vp
03:38:11 <Camail> though there is a very good chance europe only has 2 of the top 4 this major
03:38:19 <Camail> which probably hasnt happened in.... a long long time
03:39:27 <Camail> at least since the start of csgo, is my guess
03:41:18 <Camail> also i saw this posted on twitter at adren yesterday https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ce1PFf-WwAAjiwg.jpg
03:41:24 <Camail> i havent laughed like that in awhile
