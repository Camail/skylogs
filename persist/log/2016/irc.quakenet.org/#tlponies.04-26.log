02:07:05 <Camail> so ded
02:41:23 <ZK> ur face is ded
02:41:56 <Camail> omg i broken down and installed photo editting software, so many tokens to put alpha layers on
02:44:08 <ZK> wut
02:44:36 <ZK> our tokens are gonna look nicer, or the npc ones?
02:44:43 <Camail> npcs
02:44:49 <Camail> none of yours have white backgrounds
02:44:59 <ZK> DoT` does, doesnt it?
02:45:08 <Camail> yea but then he's the only one
02:45:10 <ZK> mine used to, but i did some lighting changes
02:45:19 <ZK> cause i thought white was ugly
02:45:28 <ZK> also im all white
02:45:40 <Camail> no you're asian
02:45:44 <Camail> we've went over this before
02:46:23 <ZK> wut, my dad is white
02:46:26 <ZK> my mom is asian

03:17:17 <ZK> .tell bio =D IT IS DONE! THEY ARE OUT! WOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
03:17:20 <ZK> .tell micen hah
03:28:10 <Camail> mean
03:28:23 <Camail> I feel like I know where some of the animosity towards mynu comes from now
03:29:19 <ZK> you mean, besides the fact she skewered me with a crossbow?
03:29:31 <Micen> .tell ZK Lets go Dallas.
03:29:47 <ZK> dallas is actually my pick to win the cup micen
03:30:21 <Micen> My hope is anyone but the Preds or Blues. 
03:30:32 <Micen> Anyone else and it will still be a small win. 
03:30:55 <ZK> hmm, why do you like the stars but not the preds?
03:30:59 <ZK> they all central no?
03:31:29 <Micen> Preds have a ting where they ban anyone from wearing Blackhawks stuff in their arena
03:31:40 <Micen> and if you cheer for them too loudly you get thrown out. 
03:32:14 <ZK> thats kinda shitty?
03:32:15 <Micen> Just Blackhawks fans. No one else. 
03:32:47 <ZK> i did hear the preds fans were really intense though
03:32:57 <ZK> they have a well known section thats really cool apparently
03:34:50 <Micen> I will say those drives in that game 7 were intense. im sad I missd the first peroid. 
03:35:30 <Micen> And I want Stars to win because thats the Blues next series. 
03:35:44 <BioSC> asdf
03:35:49 <Micen> so its less of a like of the Stars and more of a dislike for the team that knocked my team out.
03:35:49 <ZK> bio =D
03:35:53 <Micen> Hi Bio. 
03:35:56 <ZK> Blues! :D
03:36:00 * BioSC shakes hands with Micen
03:36:07 * Micen shakes hands with Bio
03:36:13 <Micen> There is always next year. 
03:36:13 <BioSC> fak
03:36:20 * ZK cries from not even being in the playoffs
03:36:29 <BioSC> >Remove Canada<
03:36:30 <Micen> and besides, Chicgao doesnt need more than one championship this year. 
03:36:42 <Micen> Root root root for the Cubbies!
03:36:43 <ZK> well i mean, you arent getting any
03:36:49 <ZK> oht he city
03:36:57 <Micen> Yes, the City. 
03:37:11 <ZK> baseball is boring tho
03:37:18 <Micen> Baseball is fun. 
03:37:31 <BioSC> cubs look good this year?
03:37:35 <Micen> its all numbers. and stats. and fun stuff like that
03:37:36 <BioSC> like... curse breaking good?
03:37:39 <Micen> yes
03:37:40 <ZK> i dont mind playing, but watching is so... boring
03:37:47 <Micen> Vegas odds have them taking it this year
03:38:13 <ZK> there was a year montreal was favored to win
03:38:16 <ZK> then the season got cancelled
03:38:46 <BioSC> https://twitter.com/StLouisBlues/status/724793597795684353
03:38:57 <BioSC> towel guy is my favorite part
03:38:58 <BioSC> of games
03:39:00 <Micen> Cubs already pitched a no hitter this year, winning with 16
03:39:37 <ZK> doesnt matter till the playoffs tho, no?
03:40:07 <Micen> No but if we are doing this good of a regular season, when the pressure is on for the playoffs they get even better. 
03:40:26 <Micen> They almost took it last year and made the Back to the Future predictions come true

03:41:13 <Camail> .tellm dot` skram | https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3cq4s7/bonus_actions_5e/
03:41:49 <ZK> so i can dual wield daggers a lot?
03:42:07 <Camail> you'll do like 2 damage, but sure
03:42:15 <Camail> thats roughly as impactful as your spells have been
03:42:19 <Micen> If only you had a +1 dagger to use
03:42:20 <ZK> 2d4+2 i think?
03:42:31 <ZK> yea, my spells now do a minimum of 4 damage, its better
03:42:36 <ZK> yay for lvl 2
03:42:58 <Camail> you dont get attribute modifiers for the secondary attack unless you are trained to duel wield
03:43:03 <Camail> at least thats what i read
03:43:18 <Camail> so its a raw d20 to hit and a d4 for damage
03:43:18 <ZK> yea, so dex mod on first one which is 2, and then i get 1d4 per weapon
03:43:37 <ZK> so 2d4 +2 if i get both d20s to hit
03:43:55 <Camail> yes though thats a bit misleading
03:44:14 <ZK> ?
03:44:17 <Camail> well
03:44:21 <Camail> in terms of effectiveness
03:44:26 <Camail> because hitting with a raw d20 is hard
03:45:05 <ZK> d20+ dex modifier and proficiency for both still no? 
03:45:14 <ZK> its only for damage roll that its not affected
03:45:20 <Camail> I'm not saying the math is wrong
03:45:41 <Camail> I'm saying that lumping both dice together is misleading as that usually presumes the roll two attack is the same
03:45:55 <Camail> technically its correct, given the context
03:46:02 <ZK> oh sure, i was just going for maximum damage i could get
03:46:08 <ZK> eldritch blast is still best
03:46:15 <Camail> well yea and I'm hoping for no one to ever make save throws :P
03:46:36 <Camail> next session is gonna be..interesting
03:47:06 <Camail> the spectrum of possibilities is much more varied than I initially thought, in both degree and kind
03:47:26 <Camail> well, not really in kind, only a few of those, but degree for sure
03:47:30 <ZK> so you had to prep more?
03:47:46 <Camail> I need a buffer in case you skip stuff
03:47:56 <Camail> or do things out of order that are relevant to progression
03:48:16 <Camail> also just generally re-prepping to make things look a little nicer and learn some stuff
03:49:32 <Camail> premades are nice because i can focus on discovering a work flow without also having to generate ALL of the content
03:50:25 <ZK> yea, generating content can be rough without the right mindset
03:50:32 <Camail> also skram decided his character's last name is Dickkicker
03:51:02 <Camail> I'm gonna push him to commit and make it Dicikir
03:51:15 <Camail> that sounds dwarven...enough
03:52:51 <ZK> i dunno if im supposed to have an adult name
03:53:18 <Camail> that seems up to your character
03:53:41 <Camail> the answer to that question could mean quite a bit
03:53:53 <ZK> well i mean, its in 79 years if i do that. But hten half elfs die a bit after that
03:54:16 <Camail> is that an elven tradition or something
03:54:27 <ZK> yep
03:54:36 <ZK> elves turn adult at 100 and get an adult name at that age
03:54:49 <ZK> half elfs become venerable at 125, so its probly bad idea
03:55:10 <Camail> so does she still see herself as a kid? that's the concluding question
03:55:30 <Camail> lots of variables to toggle on or off here
03:55:42 <ZK> she doesnt, but she knows shes not fully adult yet
03:57:03 <Camail> is the 'adult name' the equivalent of a surname
03:57:14 <Camail> or just like an addition tot he full name
03:57:20 <ZK> no, they change name entirely.
03:57:37 <ZK> and their kid name is a nickname that old friends may call them
03:58:11 <Camail> maybe one day Kyza won't be named after russian emperors
03:58:13 <Camail> one day
03:58:25 <ZK> wut, im named after something again?
03:58:40 <ZK> ill go back to kyka
03:58:40 <Camail> It just sounds like Kaiser, not much tho
03:58:44 <Camail> pls dont
03:58:57 <ZK> na, dont want to be named that
03:59:04 <Camail> pls
04:03:26 <BioSC> https://i.imgur.com/OuenPwG.png
04:03:28 <BioSC> oh my god

04:04:54 <BioSC> now we have to play stars
04:05:00 <BioSC> anjmslgkh;habner jyj
04:05:01 <ZK> yea, central.
04:05:06 <BioSC> THUNDERDOME
04:05:13 <ZK> it will be good game. Two offensive juggernauts
04:05:13 <BioSC> ONLY ONE TEAM CAN SURVIVE
04:05:49 <ZK> islanders vs lightning seems pretty bad to me, others i like
04:06:15 <ZK> i can see any team left winning the cup besides lightning and islanders
04:06:54 <BioSC> remind me again how i'm supposed to go to sleep
04:07:22 <ZK> oh, booze works
04:07:38 <BioSC> trust fam

15:34:21 <skram> im dont afraid of u cam
15:34:30 <DoT`> he will kill you skram
15:34:37 <DoT`> then you have to roll a new character
15:35:00 <skram> Im fine with that, I did that yesterday and rolled really well for stats
15:35:06 <DoT`> hahaha
15:35:18 <CockRoach|42> make it an alicorn next time, skram
15:35:25 <Camail> atm its taking more effort to keep you alive
15:36:28 <Phearlock> Camail wants to kill you and taxidermy your butt.
15:36:45 <skram> I dont know if cam is willing to let me homebrew a sapient horse race
15:37:28 <Camail> the only possible class that would work with that is monk
15:37:35 <Camail> unarmored, unarmed melee strikes
15:37:52 <Phearlock> Depends on how OP an alicorn it is
15:37:56 <skram> i cant be a horse barbarian?
15:37:57 <Camail> certainly no alicorn tho, flying is OP
15:38:00 <DoT`> sorceror
15:38:08 <DoT`> unicorn
15:38:09 <Camail> you need somatic components
15:38:12 <Camail> horses dont have hands
15:38:15 <Camail> cant make hand gestures
15:38:19 <Phearlock> You can roll a kobold or something. Those are sooo cute.
15:38:20 <Camail> so they cant do 99% of spells
15:38:49 <CockRoach|42> a dragon!
15:38:54 <Camail> they might know a handful of natural spells but could never learn and level like a pc
15:39:10 <Phearlock> Well that depends on how much you homebrew them =P
15:39:10 <Camail> skram just made another dwarf, probably

15:48:39 <DoT`> and micen does his best to reduce it
15:49:58 <skram> tiefling Camail
15:50:06 <skram> friggin 20 charisma
15:51:41 <ZK> wut
15:51:47 <DoT`> lol
15:51:53 <DoT`> you pick a barbarian?
15:52:01 <skram> nono sorcerer
15:52:11 <DoT`> clever pon
15:52:25 <ZK> we are gonna get killed so fast without a dwarf to tank
15:52:35 <DoT`> we will already all be ded
15:52:37 <ZK> and that damn bard always picking fights that we have to defend her with
15:53:10 <skram> i mean im not encouraging cam to kill my dwarf
15:53:20 <skram> id rather barb than the other thing
15:53:34 <ZK> ok good
15:53:37 <ZK> i dont want you to die 
15:53:39 <Phearlock> I think skrams dorf is adorbs
15:53:47 <Phearlock> Try not to die skram
15:54:09 <Camail> yea you guys are squishy
15:54:16 <DoT`> i mean, im not rushign to help the gnome with whatever comes through that dorr she opened
15:54:30 <Camail> she hasn't opened it yet
15:54:43 <ZK> isnt that why we rolled init?
15:54:50 <Camail> she was about to
15:54:56 <DoT`> she pushed it open then we rolled 
15:55:00 <Camail> the half-orc reacted to the approach
15:55:08 <Camail> she said 'I open the door"
15:55:12 <DoT`> so its not AS bad as we thought then
15:55:14 <Camail> doesnt mean she finished
15:55:26 <Camail> people dont wait for someone to finish something before they react...
15:55:40 <ZK> metal spike comes down on her head and she dies
15:56:55 <skram> u gaise so spiteful
15:56:59 <skram> lets hold hands and b frens
15:57:16 <Camail> also none of you have lockpicks
15:57:21 <Camail> which is eventually gonna be an issue
15:57:30 <DoT`> we tried that skram, the gnome shot the half elf and then she stepped on the crossbow in a tnatrum
15:57:49 <DoT`> tantrum*
15:59:09 <ZK> hey, she wants to trick me. She doesnt deserve me to be nice to her.
15:59:47 <skram> well afaik if you have a set of burglar tools or whatever you can use it without being proficient in it
15:59:47 <DoT`> are you sure your character isnt 12?
15:59:55 <skram> 19 is basically 12
16:00:04 <ZK> na, adult at 20
16:00:18 <ZK> so 19 is teenager
16:01:10 <ZK> that bard deserves nothing. She tries to trick me into giving her her crossbow with an illusion, after shooting me and thnking she just deserves it. Nope, she loses crossbow.
16:01:26 <Camail> skram yea if you have the tools you can make a roll, just wont get prof bonus
16:01:46 <skram> just need to find someone who would sell it then
16:02:10 <skram> red larch probably doesnt have a thiefs guild or something
16:05:50 <skram> anyway im gonna go outside and frolic or something

16:18:40 <Camail> .tell skram with stuff like that I would probably make you do an investigation check to search around town if you wanted to find someone who might deal in shadier items
16:45:32 <Camail> I wonder if the success of critical role is what convinced Penny Arcade to try making their dnd group a series
16:47:00 <Camail> its really the only huge success, JP has been the staple for years but clearly not a catalyst for this specific decision
16:47:12 <DoT`> there are a growing number of DnD things
16:47:29 <Camail> yea but the scale of every other dnd channel is miniscule in comparison
16:47:35 <DoT`> yea
16:47:43 <Camail> it was roughly the same size for years
16:47:51 <Camail> and kinda still is
16:48:05 <DoT`> i tihnk geek and sundry also do one?
16:48:26 <Camail> dnd is one of the harder things to stream, because you pretty much need everyone to be an entertainer in some way
16:48:27 <DoT`> not sure how bug a thing that is
16:48:29 <Camail> DoT` ...
16:48:33 <Camail> GaS is critical role
16:48:40 <DoT`> no
16:48:42 <DoT`> oh
16:48:48 <DoT`> well one that isnt cr
16:49:06 <DoT`> but i did not know it was them that did it actually
16:49:08 <Camail> they do various board games
16:49:25 <Camail> the audience would be way less if not for cr tho, they have a backbone of follows and subs that give thme audience
16:49:40 <DoT`> stupid time zones mean cr is on at like 4/5 am for me
16:49:41 <Camail> I dont even consider it a separate audience, since its all ont he same channel
16:49:53 <Camail> they put episodes up on mondays
16:50:16 <CockRoach|42> i thought you were talking about me, DoT` :)
16:50:31 <Camail> 25k watching you, live
16:50:34 <DoT`> you have many viewers too cr
16:50:38 <CockRoach|42> :O
16:50:39 <Camail> for 4 hours every thursday
16:50:46 <Camail> just sitting there
16:50:47 <CockRoach|42> oh dear
16:50:50 <Camail> probably sleeping, given the time
16:51:00 <DoT`> 25k is insane compared to basicly ANY stream
16:51:37 <Camail> yea, but thats just the nubmers right now, the PA decision had to happen months ago
16:51:50 <Camail> and yea CR is really blowing upp this year
16:52:11 <Camail> i remember seeing stuff about it when it first started but their twitch vods are sub walled so i never bothered to look it up
16:52:29 <DoT`> how many years has it been going? about 2
16:52:47 <Camail> once they were like 17 episodes in they started releasing the episodes on youtube and i found out they put them all on their site too
16:52:50 <Camail> 1, dot
16:52:54 <Camail> 50th episode last week
16:53:02 <DoT`> becuas ei recall hearing about it when it was 11 episodes in form a cousin, but i never got around to watchgn it
16:53:28 <Camail> the game itself was 2 years old before the show started
16:53:31 <Camail> but its wasnt a weekly game
16:53:37 <Camail> like once a month or something
16:53:38 <DoT`> oh yea, the wedding we where at was only about a year ago
16:54:02 <Camail> they have now spent a vast majority of their campaign on air
16:55:45 <Camail> any time I've watched vods I never watch the entire thing, sometimes skipping entire conversations idc about

22:28:08 <Dottt> no way to check
22:28:17 <Dottt> so no way to know D:
22:35:25 <Camail> ur such an empiricist
22:36:55 <Camail> dot have you figured out which cantrip you'll get
22:37:21 <Dottt> not air...
22:39:48 <Camail> hmmmmm also I'm not sure if you can spend more ki on the flame snake thing, so you can't spend 4 ki on it to do 3d10 damage
22:39:50 <Camail> but i dunno
22:40:12 <Dottt> probably picking flame for 1st cantrip
22:40:23 <Camail> I'm thinking of just saying fuck it and not trying to stay to the letter of a homebrew and just make it up myself
22:40:47 <Dottt> whatever you feel is balanced cam, and makes sense to you
22:41:15 <ZK> i like anythign that lets me blame the DM
22:42:18 <Dottt> if i had dark vision it would be so nice
22:42:35 <Camail> yea and i dont know how much i live letting monks essentially increase the level of a spell just by spending one ki point
22:42:38 <Camail> like*
22:42:52 <Camail> well, maybe its fine
22:42:59 <Dottt> well thats in the main one as well
22:43:09 <Dottt> its not made up for the homebrew
22:43:26 <Camail> odd, i am not seeing it in the phb
22:44:02 <Dottt> you mean the whole idea, or just a particulier spell?
22:44:10 <Camail> oh
22:44:11 <Camail> its in there
22:44:21 <Camail> nvm
22:44:34 <Camail> it doesnt have its own section its just part of the spellcasting info for monk
22:44:43 <Dottt> yea
22:45:15 <Dottt> its nice, as it stops spells from becoming useless 
22:46:30 <Dottt> ki even though you regain it on short rests is a very precious resource i think
22:47:49 <Camail> mostly because you actually dont have a lot of it
22:47:57 <Camail> and its your entire resource pool
22:48:21 <Camail> unlike magic users that have rapidly growing numbers to use for various levels of spells
22:48:22 <Dottt> just with flurry of blows, patient defence and step of the wind you could easly use your pool
22:49:51 <Dottt> so if you choose to increase 1 spells damage by 1 dice you cut a lot of other options out immediatly from later in the fight
22:54:33 <Camail> I really wanna make this work
22:55:00 <Camail> if there was a clear definition of "initiate this maneuver" my problems would all be gone
22:55:28 <Camail> like wtf does that mean, use a bonus action? use a ki point? just make the choice to do it?
22:55:33 <carcinisation> g'night all
22:55:38 <Dottt> gnigth reif <3
22:55:40 <Camail> there is no explicit parallel to a mechanic in the game
22:56:16 <Camail> and it's driving me insane because it can make or break these things
22:56:44 <Camail> it HAS to stand for something tho, because if not, unbroken air is fucking BROKEN
22:56:59 <Camail> if initiating the maneuver was a free action then monks would get 15 melee range for free
22:57:54 <Camail> so its either your bonus action or a ki point
22:58:18 <Camail> which takes resources or removes your ability to make a second attack
22:59:37 <Camail> also eyes of fire was lazily written
22:59:47 <Camail> it essentially says you have heat vision, but gives true sight
23:00:00 <Camail> so invisible undead wouldn't count under a strict description definition
23:00:41 <Camail> yea I'm not gonna lie there are a ton of problems but we can fix them if this is the class you want to go with
23:00:50 <Camail> ultimately this is the point of it all
23:06:10 <Dottt> cam im not sure if this helps you, but from 1 of this guys replies on reddit
23:06:13 <Dottt> "So this has been brought up before as confusing so I may have to change it. The Initiation Action is just another name for "Casting Time," since it describes both spellcasting and non-spells. I took the formatting 3.5 dnd book called Tome of Battle."
23:06:50 <Dottt> So if you want to cast Thunderwave, it's an Action to do so. You're now left with Move Action and Bonus Action. You can't use Martial Arts to punch as a bonus action the turn you cast Thunderwave, since you can only do so if you used the Attack Action, but you instead used your Action to cast the spell. You can still use your Bonus Action to Step of the Wind or Patient Defense though if you want.
23:06:58 <Dottt> wall of text >.>
23:11:10 <ZK> Dottt, what spells do you currently have? Or do they not appear till lvl 3?
23:11:22 <Dottt> lvl 3
23:11:26 <ZK> kk
23:11:31 <ZK> thats when i get my dragon =D
23:11:40 <Dottt> or we die at 2
23:11:44 <Dottt> :P
23:14:15 <ZK> i dont want to fite, you guys always picking fites with everyone :o
23:16:57 <DuB`> Movie moved.
23:16:57 <ZK> how was it?
23:17:43 <DuB`> Movie was... moving?
23:17:58 <ZK> i can believe that
23:18:00 <DuB`> Moral of the story: tigers and monkey = bad, wolves and bears = good.
23:18:07 <DuB`> Or somefin'.
23:21:03 <Dottt> rude
23:26:00 <Dottt> cam, i am bad, why is fists of unbroken air so broken? like i could hit guys and then move away with no disingage, but they can just step next to me in thier turn
23:26:13 <Camail> not if skram is also standing there
23:26:35 <Camail> if you tie up the enemies correctly it could make guerilla tactics extremely easy
23:26:52 <Dottt> then everyone beats up skram D:
23:27:01 <ZK> :D
23:27:18 <Camail> or they go after you
23:27:48 <ZK> i do have a thing that lets me knock people back 10 feet if i want. but meh
23:28:17 <Dottt> ooh, because i could knock them back 10 feet THEN move away?
23:28:27 <ZK> yeppers
23:28:28 <Camail> that as well
23:28:37 <Camail> the point is giving free 15 melee range can probably do all sorts of things
23:28:38 <Camail> at level 3
23:28:39 <ZK> be an aang
23:28:44 <Dottt> knock ppl into skram :P
23:28:49 <Camail> with a game designed around melee encounters being 5 feet
23:28:56 <Camail> with occasional 10 foot weapons
23:29:18 <Dottt> well cam, i wont take that skill
23:29:55 <Dottt> what others give you problem? i can only pick 2 and there are a fair number
23:30:06 <Dottt> i like the look of water whip
23:30:12 <Dottt> so i have 1 other choice
23:30:13 <Camail> I'd rather attempt to fix them rather than just ignoring them
23:30:23 <Camail> because you will have the later option to repick
23:30:42 <Camail> honestly they're all fine, this homebrew monk is kinda just a hidden spellcaster
23:31:08 <Camail> looking through the options a vast majority are just letting you cast a spell
23:31:10 <Dottt> its like the fighters arcane trickster kinda
23:32:38 <Camail> i can live with initiating the maneuver being the bonus action, and then the disipline applies to your main(attack) action
23:33:01 <Camail> but I'd have to think through it
23:33:11 <Dottt> but i dont believe thats how it works
23:33:20 <Camail> that's not how they say it works
23:33:24 <Camail> but that might be how i say it works
23:34:02 <Camail> not every discipline says that it initiates a maneuver
23:34:12 <Camail> only the ones that alter your unarmed strikes
23:34:15 <Camail> hmmmmm
23:34:24 <Camail> but unarmed strikes are a d4
23:34:31 <Camail> so that probably balances it out?
23:34:56 <Camail> mostly thinking out loud
23:35:17 <Camail> it honestly completely slipped my mind that these wouldn't affect your spear attacks
23:36:39 <Camail> OH
23:36:47 <Camail> no dot what you were tlaking about wasnt what i was tlaking about
23:37:02 <Camail> you are talking about 'initiating action' in bold
23:37:08 <Camail> I'm tlkaing about sentences like this:
23:37:18 <Camail> "When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can
23:37:18 <Camail> initiate this maneuver"
23:37:49 <Camail> so for now I'm just gonna allow all of it
23:38:06 <Camail> because if the goal is to try and fix it we need to play test it
23:38:27 <Camail> and after considering the fact that its only unarmed strikes, fine, for now
23:39:35 <Camail> will probably have a more concrete verdict after the 4th session
23:40:13 <Camail> ZK start your next feud with Rho so he's dead by lvl 3 pls
23:40:23 <ZK> ok sure
23:41:13 <Dottt> wait, so what was the verdict on Initiate this action, that they mean you do thing, or that you use a bonus acytion to do thing
23:42:09 <Dottt> frp, my understanding its, when you attack, you may choose its like this or not
23:42:22 <Dottt> like chooosing if an attack is non-lethal
23:45:26 -!- motbob_ [~motbob@x-128-101-215-216.reshalls.umn.edu] has joined #tlponies
23:45:51 <Camail> ok so the disicplines have a section telling you what the initiating action is
23:45:58 <Dottt> yes
23:46:08 <Camail> that's just whatever the spell decides it to be
23:46:13 <Camail> it the triggering event
23:46:16 <Camail> or the aciton you use
23:46:29 <Camail> the equivalent of casting time, so what he said
23:46:32 <Camail> that was never an issue tho
23:46:40 <Camail> the issue has been in the actual spell descriptions
23:47:03 <Camail> the issue has been the sentence i quoted
23:47:36 <Camail> but, I'm not going to take any extra steps to change it just yet
23:48:02 <Camail> for now we'll assume that its just a fluff sentence
23:48:20 <Camail> and if the disciplines turn out to be too good I can tweak it
23:48:32 <Camail> but first you have to actually get the spells :P
23:48:52 <ZK> i wonder at which level i should multiclass as a rogue
23:48:53 <Dottt> i will just die at lvl 2 and make all this discussion wasted time
23:49:01 <ZK> i want the cunning action to hide after each action
23:49:07 <Camail> but the thing you brought up from the thread and the thing that I am concerned aobut are different things
23:49:13 <Camail> they just use the same word
23:49:19 <Dottt> yea, i see 
23:49:32 <Dottt> its only that speel that says it there and in that way
23:49:40 <Camail> flame one too
23:49:51 <Dottt> yes, sry
23:49:59 <Camail> which is fine, we'll test the waters
23:50:49 <Camail> also RIP me i forgot to properly scale a map so now the misalignment is twice as bad as i thought
23:51:20 <Dottt> https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/3sf2xs/homebrew_way_of_the_four_elements_monk_remastered/
23:51:46 <Dottt> in this thread cam, he has a longish discussion with someone about fists of air and a few other things
23:52:22 <Camail> can you link te comment
23:52:44 <Camail> nvm
23:52:46 <Camail> tihnk i found it
23:52:54 <Dottt> ok
23:57:01 <Camail> most of it they are tlkaing aobut a previous vversion
23:57:09 <Camail> so kind of useless but gives some insight
23:57:40 <Dottt> blarg
23:57:44 <Camail> lol
23:57:52 <Camail> it looks like i found an answer to another confusion i had
23:57:57 <Camail> the spell has a range of 30
23:57:58 <Camail> for no reason
23:58:04 <Camail> when it is funciotnall parallel to the fire one
23:58:07 <Camail> which has a range of self
23:58:19 <Camail> i think that the move used to be an aoe spell
23:58:25 <Camail> and he forgot to change the range to self
23:58:35 <Camail> he only changed the description
23:59:15 <Dottt> oh lol, i never saw that it had range 30 written there
23:59:25 <Camail> yea i was like...the fuck?
23:59:57 <Dottt> give versoin 3 please!
