00:18:56 <BioSC> PICNIC
00:24:57 <DoT`> I dont think its helped micen im still confused! but its a very sad tale
00:26:58 <Micen> Its just a modern telling of of things like the stories of the greek pantheon. you have your myths, characters come and go, and new ones replaces others as they get old.  that and its fun to see crazy shit
00:28:22 <DoT`> State is playing today
00:28:36 <Micen> being able to see things like this. https://twitter.com/WWE/status/676211209075494912?ref_src=twsrc^tfw
00:28:38 <DoT`> no pengu

00:31:00 <DoT`> lol
00:31:07 <Micen> look at how crazy that is
00:31:48 <Phearlock> They have some good stuntmen
00:31:57 <Phearlock> I can respect the crazy stunts
00:32:45 <Micen> and I mean thats what they are, actors who do their own stunts. 
00:33:05 <Micen> who do things like that, literally risking their bodies for the entertainment of others. 
00:33:30 <Micen> one wrong move off that ladder for either of them and one or both of them could have been paralyzed from the landing
00:33:57 <DoT`> i think i recall one dying like 15 years ago from a messed up entrance
00:35:52 <Micen> yeah 
00:36:14 <Micen> owen hart
00:36:46 <Micen> that was in 99
00:36:55 <DoT`> i cant believe i even recalled the actuall manner of death amd al;most got the year right

23:40:53 <Camail> ugh
23:41:18 <Camail> DoT`  finally finished OPM, pretty great
23:41:38 <Camail> as good as they could do in 12 episodes
23:41:47 <Micen|Stream> I need more OPM now
23:42:07 <DoT`> i really enjoyed it
23:42:50 <DoT`> and i have read up to the latest one done by Murata
23:42:59 <DoT`> i dont know if i want to read the non pretty picture version
23:43:16 <Camail> the webo comic is not useful
23:43:19 <Camail> web*
23:43:34 <Camail> is there even an english translation?
23:43:45 <DoT`> not sure
23:43:51 <Camail> DoT`  on a scale of 1 to 10 how much to you love King
23:43:54 <Camail> cuz he's the best
23:43:59 <DoT`> HAHA
23:44:03 <DoT`> strongest ever
23:44:03 <Camail> The Best.
23:44:23 <DoT`> beat 32 heroes in a row
23:44:43 <Camail> I wish we got to see Blizzard
23:44:47 <Camail> she had a great design
23:44:58 <Camail> Like Tornado but less loli
23:45:26 <Camail> oh wait we did see her in the anime
23:45:30 <Camail> but she never did anything
23:45:33 <DoT`> well she only really starts showing up in OPM after the part where s1 ended
23:46:50 <Camail> its hard for me to remember
23:46:53 <Camail> its been so long
23:47:15 <Camail> I lvoet he stinger after ep 12
23:47:26 <Camail> I love stingers in general
23:47:58 <DoT`> stingers?  
23:48:33 <Camail> after-credits stuff
23:48:53 <Camail> there's a little scene at the very end of ep 12
23:49:06 <DoT`> i missed a lot of them, i only realised they where there half way through
23:49:14 <Camail> also the Boros fight was pretty solid
23:49:15 <DoT`> so i have somethnig when i rewatch it
23:50:07 <DoT`> i love saitama's naming of his moves
23:50:13 <Camail> i need to get back into the manga but i stopped reading after the boros arc finished
23:50:20 <Camail> because itt akes effort to keep up with a manga
23:50:29 <Camail> serious punch is so sick
23:50:48 <Camail> I cant remember if they do the huge earth view of the clouds in the manga, probably
23:50:53 <Camail> the manga is framed like an anime
23:51:32 <DoT`> they added some nice stuff in the anime
23:51:36 <DoT`> scene wise
23:52:08 <DoT`> they didnt really miss much out
23:52:46 <Camail> the metal knight scene they missed
23:52:59 <Camail> the beginning of that chapter had the sick multiple page spread
23:54:54 <DoT`> which chapter?
23:55:54 <Camail> the asteroid arc
23:59:36 <DoT`> thats the scene the introduce him
23:59:52 <DoT`> he shows up says he is here to test then faills
