04:11:37 <Bio> the other was mis
04:11:47 <Wikt_> we've recently developed a strat that's kinda cheesy
04:11:53 <Wikt_> we all get into melee
04:12:03 <Wikt_> once the green add spawns, the fel chain people go out
04:12:09 <Wikt_> everyone else including some non soaking ranged stays
04:12:22 <Wikt_> and you heroism, ring, destroy the green add
04:12:33 <Wikt_> from there on just do the fight and sac people on black holes

04:17:08 <Wikt> doing the same thing over and over consistently with no mistakes
04:17:34 <Wikt> with every phase you change positioning a bit but the basic things you do stay the same
04:17:48 <Wikt> and don't panic with wrath of gul'dan
04:18:00 <Wikt> that shit does nothing on its own as long as people don't clip each other when they both have it
04:18:14 <Wikt> you just gotta get your hunters and other cooldown spammers to take it off

21:07:14 <carcinisation> gg
21:08:31 <DoT|Phone> gg
21:08:58 <ZK> i was in general chat and someone says he feels sad
21:09:07 <ZK> then i start talking to him and he responds
21:09:10 <ZK> he just leaves
21:09:19 <ZK> i started feeling attached to that random sc2 player
21:09:25 <DoT|Phone> aww
21:11:00 <DuB`> No more ZK.
21:11:04 <DuB`> No more seagull.
21:11:06 <DuB`> rip
21:11:17 <ZK> seagull?
21:11:42 <DuB`> Oberwaj.
21:13:59 <DoT|Phone> onlywatch
21:14:56 <DoT|Phone> guess dub has to stream
21:15:07 <DuB`> Going out to lunch soon.
21:15:12 <DuB`> Parents are driving down.
21:15:31 <DoT|Phone> it's nine at night
21:15:45 <DoT|Phone> too late for lunch
21:16:16 <ZK> lilbow the last protoss
21:17:47 <DoT|Phone> lilbow is silly
21:20:30 <ZK> he was good at some point
21:21:47 <DuB`> I dunno if seagull's team is entering the thing tomorrow?
21:22:03 <DuB`> I want to see them go all out against the soupbase, f3rg, etc team.
21:22:27 <DuB`> Those guys keep complaining about / trash talking seagull and co...
21:22:34 <ZK> i rarely look at the sc2 maps, but man the backgrounds are incredible
21:23:25 <DoT|Phone> duuuuub
21:23:42 <ZK> wut a colossus
21:23:49 <ZK> no one makes those anymore, silly lilbow
21:24:00 <DoT|Phone> are you already keeping track of overwatch drama
21:27:10 <DuB`> It has just kind of naturally happened in trying to find/watch as many of the actual serious streams as I can.
21:27:32 <DuB`> Not the community figures /etc. from other games.
21:28:15 <DoT|Phone> What they got against seagull
21:31:29 <DuB`> Well today they keep queuing into sea's 6stack and losing to abusive/crazy strats because they're only 2 or 3stack.
21:31:36 <DuB`> Or something.
21:32:12 <DuB`> They were scrimming a little last night and f3rg kept getting way pumped up every time he could kill seagull. xD
21:33:28 <DuB`> Soupbase is, like, Seagull #2 and they keep talking him up, saying he's way better.
21:33:34 <DuB`off> Lunch!
21:35:18 <DoT|Phone> so silly

21:53:14 <DoT`> .roll d20 for camail being a butt
21:53:22 <ZK> that seems so weird
21:53:39 <Camail> Cane  RIP you
21:54:32 <ZK> hey DoT`, did you do your CS game like you said you would?
21:54:56 <DoT`> did i say i would?
21:55:06 <DoT`> i was fixing the game today
21:55:18 <ZK> you said you needed to or else camail would be angry
21:55:33 <DoT`> i never said angry
21:55:47 <DoT`> zk , this is like sheldon all over again
21:55:58 <Camail> grrrr
21:56:00 <Camail> etc.
21:56:15 <ZK> [12:45] <3DoT`> i also need to get my rank back before cam assualts me
21:56:29 <DoT`> there is no anger there
21:56:34 <ZK> hmm good point
21:56:45 <ZK> cam does not need to be angry to assault ppl at all.
21:57:13 <DoT`> I did fix the random stutter i was getting so thats nice
21:57:38 <DoT`> stupid HDD, moved the game to my SSD
21:58:35 <Camail> having it on ur ssd is nice
21:58:39 <Camail> also how did that even happen
21:58:47 <Camail> thats a lot of data to just....move
21:59:08 <DoT`> i installed it where i install all my games, on my 2 tb hdd
21:59:15 <carcinisation> gg
22:00:07 <DoT`> it takes 5 minutes to copy over to the SSD
22:00:21 <DoT`> and point steam there
22:03:53 <DoT`> but everytihng i was finding in regards to stutter was about old sound drivers and such
22:04:10 <DoT`> so it took a lot longer to fix tryning all the things that worked for others
22:04:15 <Yolteotl> excuses

22:10:54 <DoT`> how are you doing cam?
22:11:57 <Camail> OH, i was confused by your sentence, i thought your HDD was the thing that moved the game to the ssd
22:12:10 <Camail> not that your hdd was the problem so YOU moved it
22:12:15 <Camail> that makes more sense
22:12:22 <Camail> that you're hdd isn't sentient
22:12:55 <DoT`> i hope not, its not attached securly enough for that
22:18:58 <CockRoach|42> maybe one morning you will wake up and the HDD is spooning you in bed
22:26:34 <ZK> lol, my sc2 division, no protoss in top 25
