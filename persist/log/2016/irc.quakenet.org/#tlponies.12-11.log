01:42:10 <skram> im out of shitty music for you DuB`
01:42:16 <DuB`> Aw.
01:42:29 <DuB`> I'll just go listen to that speedcore thing I linked again.
01:42:37 <DuB`> That oughta tide me over for a few more weeks, at least.
01:42:40 <Dot`> if only runbun was here, he always has great music links
01:42:41 <skram> if you decide to learn norwegian I have some good stuff for you though.
01:42:56 <DuB`> Norwegian! 
01:43:03 <DuB`> The perfect combo for my EN and JP.
01:43:19 <Dot`> i should learn norwegion
01:43:41 <Dot`> i know Hedge already
01:43:52 <DuB`> Perfect.
01:44:15 <skram> The word you are trying to say is swedish though
01:44:40 <DuB`> :thinking:
01:44:50 <Dot`> same thing
01:44:57 <skram> ...
01:45:11 <skram> how fuckin dare you
01:45:11 <DuB`> Skram what is Bokmål?
01:45:18 <skram> goddamn chav
01:45:23 <DuB`> !?
01:45:29 <skram> Its the written form of norwegian, DuB`.
01:45:39 <DuB`> Are there TWO norwegians??
01:45:42 <DuB`> Halp.
01:45:45 <skram> One of them anyway. There is 2 (nynorsk)
01:45:51 <Dot`> skram, if im wrong you have only yourself to blame, your the one that teachs me norwegion
01:46:06 <DuB`> https://www.duolingo.com/course/no-BO/en/Learn-Norwegian-(Bokm%C3%A5l)-Online
01:46:13 <DuB`> Because this would be convenient.
01:46:33 <skram> First one is sorta the proper one but nobody talks like that, the second one is like an amalgation of different dialects
01:46:36 <DuB`> Dot, you learn nynorsk and I'll learn bokmal.
01:46:45 <skram> Or something. I never paid too much attention in lit :p
01:46:46 <DuB`> Then we can combine to be one whole norwegian.
01:46:48 <Dot`> which one is viking?
01:46:49 <motbob> Dota 7.00!
01:47:34 <DuB`> skram this is too confusing already.
01:47:40 <skram> Dont bother with nynorsk DuB`
01:48:04 <skram> Its similar enough that you can read it but has different enough grammar rules to make it confusing
01:48:12 <DuB`> !?
01:48:14 <DuB`> ytho
01:48:46 <Golly> bcuz
01:48:50 <skram> Everyone who has ever been in 8th grade are curious too
01:49:06 <skram> Actually I think the odd mountain people use it more
01:49:17 <DuB`> skram please become viking president and fix this mess.
01:49:19 <skram> ie gudbransdal
01:49:22 <Dot`> so what is correct norwegion?
01:49:31 <DuB`> Norweggy!
01:49:36 <Dot`> lol
01:49:50 <skram> bokmål for writing
01:49:57 <skram> any of the >9000 dialects for speaking
01:50:02 <Dot`> ...
01:50:15 <Dot`> english is seeming easier
01:50:18 <Dot`> :P
01:50:27 <DuB`> 9000??
01:50:34 <DuB`> It's not even a large country.
01:50:38 <Dot`> OVER 9000 dub
01:50:57 <skram> Lotsa remote places DuB`
01:51:03 <Dot`> each person basicly talks how they want
01:51:06 <DuB`> Does every single person in the country just create dialects in their free time?
01:51:08 <DuB`> What dot said.
01:51:09 <Dot`> and call it a dialect
01:51:30 <DuB`> I'm gonna call apples "floofenboff", +1 english dialect.
01:51:39 <DuB`> Terribly silly.
01:51:43 <skram> Like there's people who live on 1 side of a lake and someone who lives on the other side, and they speak entirely differently and hate each other
01:52:00 <Dot`> but you all gather to hate the danish
01:52:03 <Dot`> what a country!
01:52:14 <skram> some things unite us
01:52:36 <motbob> Dota 7 PogChamp
01:52:57 <Phearlock> skipping 3, 4, 5 and 6
01:52:58 <Dot`> i missed dota 3 to 6
01:53:07 <Phearlock> hype!
01:53:07 <DuB`> Skram it's trying to teach me "en mann" but half the n's sound like m's.
01:53:22 <skram> ...no?
01:53:28 <skram> gimme link
01:53:42 <DuB`> In duolingo.
01:53:55 <DuB`> HVEM ER DU?
01:53:58 <Dot`> skram must take 10 minutes a day to teach me
01:54:19 <DuB`> "jeg" is pronounced "YAII"
01:54:20 <DuB`> y
01:54:32 <DuB`> JEG ER EN MANN
01:54:36 <Dot`> j is never a j sound 
01:54:48 <DuB`> Yai ar en mom
01:54:57 <Dot`> haha
01:55:30 <skram> its very clearly two N's
01:55:32 <skram> ???
01:56:50 <DuB`> "Gutt", lovely word for boy.
01:57:08 <skram> you know so many things now
01:57:31 <DuB`> JAG ER IKKE EN KVINNE
01:57:43 <skram> jeg*
01:57:50 <DuB`> o ya
01:59:02 <DuB`> Er dot en kvinne?
01:59:10 <skram> Nei, han er en gutt!
01:59:19 <DuB`> :D
02:00:10 <DuB`> Han er en mann, ikke en gutt!
02:00:14 <Golly> english does not have a seperate sound for Y
02:00:30 <Golly> you say I-E
02:00:57 <Dot`> what you call me dub!
02:01:09 <DuB`> ;D ;D ;D
02:01:40 <motbob> idk if it's i-e
02:02:19 <motbob> i don't know how to describe it other than an ee (as in free) sounds that smoothly transitions into the rest of the word
02:03:32 <motbob> for example, yak is basically pronounced the same as the non-existant work eeak except that the ee sound is not emphasized or dwelled upon at all in yak
02:10:53 <skram> Are you fluent yet DuB`
02:11:25 <DuB`> Yah.
02:11:33 <DuB`> Time to learn about food.
02:11:58 <Dot`> dubs day off form study and he studies
02:12:00 <Dot`> what a pon
02:12:26 <DuB`> ... true.
02:12:32 <skram> DuB`, Woodentoaster is still really good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjo4mFzBGoc
02:12:59 <skram> I really really like the synths in his music
02:13:39 <DuB`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d45eikqcEPo
02:13:46 <DuB`> Half a pony best pony.
02:14:08 <Dot`> this is rather discordant
02:14:16 <skram> Ya this is some harsh shit
02:14:37 <skram> way too pleb for this DuB`
02:14:43 <skram> show me some lady gaga dubstep remixes instead pls
02:14:48 <DuB`> Heh! Igorr is pretty wild.
02:14:57 <DuB`> Was just reminded of him yesterday, was really nostalgic.
02:15:11 <DuB`> Hadn't listened to it since 2013 or something.
02:18:35 <skram> are you a person that listen to shoegaze dub
02:18:49 <DuB`> I haven't heard that term.
02:19:28 <skram> Its... Things that sound like My Bloody Valentine, I guess?
02:19:39 <DuB`> Who?
02:19:52 <Camail> pls
02:20:04 <DuB`> Hmmmnope.
02:20:19 <DuB`> Based on my 30-second skim-through of one album. :P
02:22:22 <DuB`> "Be sure to drop the t sound, otherwise you might sound rather Swedish."
02:22:38 <skram> Its like this big droning dickpunch of sound that sorta swirls around and eats your brain
02:23:07 <Dot`> lol
02:23:09 <DuB`> What I listened to could be described as "blurry rock". :P
02:23:16 <skram> Often very atmospheric and more concerned about creating textures and soundscapes than having good melodies
02:23:24 <DuB`> Yeah, blurry.
02:24:26 <DuB`> THIS is droning and atmospheric: https://vimeo.com/20840037
02:24:28 <DuB`> ;D
02:25:26 <DuB`> Milk is melk, perfect.
02:26:12 <skram> is this what yoga music is dub
02:26:23 <Camail> wait since when did sweetie have a vimeo plugin

02:28:12 <skram> not drink
02:28:17 <skram> reasons dub
02:28:24 <skram> i expect youll learn all about it
02:28:40 <DuB`> "mannen drikker ikke" is pretty fun to say, though.
02:28:57 <skram> are you saying your lines out loud? :p
02:29:02 <DuB`> Of course.
02:29:09 <skram> excellent
02:29:22 <DuB`> I have learned a language I know how this goes! :P

02:31:34 <skram> ØØØØØØØØØ
02:31:41 <DuB`> This song is lovely, though.
02:32:15 <Dot`> i think dub is going to be better at this language thing than me
02:32:25 <DuB`> Duolingo, dot!
02:32:46 <skram> I'm already 2% fluent in german!
02:34:19 <Camail> languages would be easy if you never had to learn extensive vocabulary
02:34:35 <Camail> i hate foreign vocab with a passion
02:35:25 <DuB`> Unfortunately words are a big part of languages. :T
02:35:29 <DuB`> I know what you mean, though.
02:35:35 <DuB`> Learning the rules/mechanics is the fun part.
02:36:10 <skram> ...I like new words more than grammar, honestly.
02:37:13 <Bio> like FUK U

02:59:01 <DuB`> Oh boi
02:59:35 <skram> god would be singular
02:59:46 <DuB`> Yepyep
03:10:22 <DuB`> Hype csgo~
03:20:54 <DuB`> Wowow
03:26:09 <skram> im going to bed dub
03:26:10 <skram> good luck
03:26:17 <DuB`> God natt
03:31:21 <Camail> i come back to a chat
03:31:24 <Camail> filled with memes
03:31:26 <Camail> sigh
03:31:59 <motbob> go hang out in dota 2 hangouts
03:32:00 <DuB`> And NORSK!
03:32:08 <motbob> fewer memes, more hype
03:33:26 <Camail> also if he has the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan then you can assume all the other stuff is in there cuz I'm pretty sure that's the last thing he does
03:33:57 <Camail> fun fact, naruto is a nice casual read if you use the wiki and never ever watch passed season 2 of the anime
03:34:32 <Camail> sakura is stuck in a loveless marriage to an edge lord
03:34:36 <Camail> its great
03:34:52 <Camail> DuB`  THEY NAMED THEIR DAUGHTER SALAD
03:34:55 <DuB`> Wot
03:35:08 <Camail> http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sarada_Uchiha
03:35:25 <DuB`> Bahah
03:35:38 <Camail> fuck this weeb earth
03:36:17 <Camail> naruto named his son boruto
03:36:25 <DuB`> This article is... extensive.
03:36:26 <Camail> aka Bolt
03:36:35 <Camail> YEA MAN NARUTO WEEBS ARE SRS
03:36:46 <Camail> and she isn't even in the main series
03:37:08 <Camail> http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sasuke_Uchiha
03:37:11 <Camail> look at that shit
03:37:13 <Camail> it doesn't end
03:37:32 <Camail> "Two years after saving Konoha from a meteorite, Sasuke travelled alongside his now pregnant wife Sakura, who refused to leave his side."
03:37:36 <Camail> is this a fan fic?
03:37:40 <Camail> nope its  FUCKING NOT
03:38:45 <motbob> it crossed my mind to go through some anime wikipedia articles and chop down the size of the episode synopses
03:38:46 <DuB`> Goodness.
03:39:46 <Camail> that sounds like a recipe tog et a ton of your own effort reverted in a few hours
03:43:44 <Camail> we have to give naruto credit tho, sasuke is a shit
03:43:48 <Camail> he was and always will be a shit
03:44:07 <Camail> he doesn't have a catharsis, he never learns, he is just an asshole forever
03:44:09 <Camail> like in real life
03:44:46 <Camail> i wouldnt have the balls to do that because as a reader having such a static character is boring as hell
03:56:44 <motbob> i thought the best moment in naruto was the end of the naruto-sasuke fight before the timeskip
03:57:10 <motbob> and sasuke running away instead of killing naruto
03:57:25 <motbob> so his character contributed at least that
04:16:32 <Camail> https://youtu.be/NejLNdC2_Ps?t=2m46s
04:16:36 <Camail> this is possibly
04:16:45 <Camail> the most epic moment of sf5 this entire year
04:16:51 <Camail> the BALLS
04:16:53 <Camail> the massive balls
04:17:46 <Camail> i have never seen such a display of domination in any fighting game
04:18:06 <Camail> especially vs this quality of player
04:19:55 <Camail> this is what happens when the 20 year old is the best in the world...
05:35:59 <motbob> i'm huge in japan http://manturn.blog.jp/archives/640883.html
05:38:47 <Camail> nice
05:40:23 <motbob> someone else made a better twitch tool so I discontinued mine and just linked to it
05:41:01 <motbob> for reference, it's https://github.com/Franiac/TwitchLeecher
05:41:16 <motbob> fast, has a UI, lets you choose start/end times
05:45:59 <Camail> UIs are the best
05:46:24 <Camail> they aren't very hard to make tho, its easier to learn than figuring out how to make twitch vods
06:04:21 <motbob> no way
06:04:47 <motbob> on second thought maybe yes way
06:05:25 <motbob> i guess I spent a very large part of my life building different iterations of my Twitch VOD tool and not as much time learning how to make an app with a UI
06:05:55 <motbob> but I think that was because I learned python to do the former and already knew python when I set out to do the latter
06:08:01 <Camail> tkinter is very easy to learn, at least
06:08:42 <motbob> i used pygtk
06:10:48 <motbob> looking over tkinter, I can't figure out if it's easier or harder
06:11:18 <Camail> tkinter might be harder
06:11:30 <Camail> looking at a hello world with pygtk and it looks simpler
06:12:02 <Camail> dealing with  frames in tkinter and stuff seems more complicated than windows in pygtk
06:12:25 <Camail> but making buttons do stuff is exactly the same in both
06:13:15 <Camail> either way, a good tutorial can get you a good enough understanding in a day or so? then just figuring out as you go
06:13:33 <Camail> theres an IDE that auto generates a gui, i need to find that
06:15:12 <Camail> the only good thing about tkinter is that its included in the install
06:15:22 <Camail> its really bare bones and ugly
06:19:57 <motbob> https://i.gyazo.com/5ed8d5058ae52a523cd4cd2cd5877389.png pygtk doesn't exactly generate beautiful GUIs either
06:24:06 <Camail> ok so this is something i wrote 1-2 years back when learning tkinter https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aborgo/Certification_Work/master/guilayout_2.py
06:24:22 <Camail> lots of frames and buttons
06:24:29 <Camail> i dunno if this is more compliacted or less than pygtk
06:24:47 -!- DoT|Phone [~Dot@2.220.170.114] has joined #tlponies
06:25:22 <Camail> i honestly dont remember exactly what everything does in this file
06:27:11 <Camail> this is still relatively simple, seeing as the buttons are all just sitting at the bottom stretch to with the width of the window
06:28:10 <Camail> ok I am 99% sure that the "<1>" is meant to be the code associates with a lmb click
06:38:04 <Camail> oh motbob maybe use pyqt
06:38:07 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmo8eZG5I2w
06:38:15 <Camail> this is what i was trying to remember
06:41:08 <motbob> now that I have written a bigass program in pygtk, no way i'll ever switch
06:42:07 <motbob> ...i think i lost the source of the program I wrote
06:42:21 <motbob> someday I'll learn how to use github
06:42:34 <Camail> thats more important than knowing python or pygtk
06:42:44 <motbob> why
06:42:51 <motbob> i have written two programs ever
06:42:57 <Camail> you lost one
06:42:58 <motbob> and they were each single python files
06:43:08 <Camail> thats a 50% failure rate
06:43:22 <Camail> also its really easy because they have a windows app
06:43:26 <Camail> I'm assuming you use windows
06:43:29 <motbob> ya
06:43:37 <motbob> hmm
06:43:39 <Camail> its basically drop box, at that point
06:43:46 <Camail> like its one level removed from dropbox
06:43:55 <motbob> i used a python to exe program so maybe there's a way to get the source from that
06:44:18 <Camail> .exe is a compiled dinary form of python, i dont think you can go back
06:44:34 <Camail> well
06:45:08 <motbob> "extract EXE's appended data (block starting with PYZ, until the end of the file)"
06:45:22 <motbob> stackoverflow seems to think there's a way
06:45:27 <Camail> yea probably
06:45:39 <motbob> but they say do the quoted thing and I have no idea how to do the quoted thing
06:45:40 <Camail> I thought i read something saying otherwise but still decided to google it
06:45:43 <Camail> and found the same threads
06:47:22 <Camail> stack overflow has another question about how to do that...it is not immediately illuminating
06:52:38 <Camail> maybe look at pefile
06:52:39 <Camail> http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2014/how-can-one-extract-the-appended-data-of-a-portable-executable
06:53:13 <Camail> find the offset then just read the data, and hope it makes sense
07:17:19 <motbob> i got a file that sort of looks like it is the correct file
07:19:49 <motbob> ...but man, it just isn't
07:21:36 <Camail> what's different
07:24:39 <motbob> dunno, it's not in text, it's in gibberish. "bytecode"? idk
07:26:24 <motbob> no file extension
07:27:24 <Camail> https://sourceforge.net/projects/decompyle/
07:27:28 <Camail> maybe that will help?
07:27:54 <Camail> errr
07:27:58 <Camail> nvm i think thats old
07:28:15 <Camail> i dunno what would work with 3.4, which is what you were probably using?
07:28:39 <motbob> 2.7
07:29:04 <motbob> hey, how do I uninstall python librarier
07:30:04 <Camail> ummmm, i would assume you just delete them from the library directory
07:30:32 <Camail> python looks for libraries by searching the directories in PATH, there is nothing special about it
07:31:14 <Camail> https://github.com/wibiti/uncompyle2
07:31:28 <Camail> this is a byte-code decompiler for 2.7
07:31:50 <Camail> the real question is if your byte code is the right bytecode
07:31:57 <Camail> which you'll find out!
07:32:34 <motbob> i just installed that and it didn't give me a windows exe
07:33:55 <Camail> it seems to be entirely in python
07:34:01 <Camail> probably run it through the python interpretor
07:34:27 <motbob> "./scripts/uncompyle2 -h prints usage"
07:34:39 <motbob> this says "lol shoulda used linux" to me
07:35:03 <Camail> >_>
07:35:17 <Camail> did you try "python setup.py bdist_rpm"
07:35:57 <Camail> i have a linux vm for problems like this
07:36:10 <Camail> its easier to interact with the coding community through linux
07:38:49 <Camail> that looks like a linux thing too
07:40:53 <Camail> oh you can run RPMs if you use cygwin apparently... but at this point you being to forget what the original problem actually was...
07:46:41 <motbob> i got it working
07:46:44 <motbob> but it didn't work
07:46:48 <motbob> if that makes any sense
07:47:02 <motbob> uncompyle2 works but was not the correct program to use
08:05:27 <Camail> boo
08:05:52 <Camail> did it hit an error
08:06:01 <Camail> or did it just produce nonsense
08:06:19 <Camail> you could ask stack exchange
08:09:05 <Camail> tell them what you used to compile, what version of python, and any follow up info if they ask for it
08:09:09 <Camail> should be enough
08:18:53 <motbob> well
08:18:58 <motbob> here is the main problem
08:19:35 <motbob> there are a lot of articles that say, "I used pyinstaller's built-in archive viewer to extract the source script and it worked perfectly immediately
08:19:57 <motbob> they just get a plain text script whereas I get gibberish with snippets of plain text
08:20:24 <motbob> for example, the original script had a string that gets displayed in the program. That string is in plain text in the gibberish file.
08:20:41 <motbob> But from what I can tell, no one else is having this problem
08:22:47 <motbob> do you have a linux environemtn easily accessible?
08:23:51 <motbob> oh, i just tried the method on version 1.0 of the program, and it worked
08:24:02 <motbob> i have the source now
08:24:29 <motbob> but the exe for 1.1 just doesn't work with the method that everyone else on the internet seems to be able to use...
08:25:01 <motbob> basically, I seem to have accidentally obfuscated my source code
08:27:41 <motbob> for my 1.1 release
08:30:17 <Camail> did anything else change about 1.1 other than the code
08:30:29 <Camail> you probably wouldnt remember, otherwise you would know by now
08:31:22 <motbob> no it was literally the same process to generate everything
08:31:28 <motbob> pyinstaller vgbc.py
08:31:35 <motbob> not complicated
08:31:49 <motbob> i did not install a new version of pyinstaller because I would not have had a reason to
08:32:24 <motbob> there would not even have been any new dependencies with the changes I made from 1.0 --> 1.1
08:35:19 <Camail> other possible method: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyinstallerextractor/
08:35:22 <Camail> then https://sourceforge.net/projects/easypythondecompiler/
08:36:02 <Camail> i am out of ideas tho
08:36:10 <Camail> at least you have 1.0
08:36:59 <motbob> it's not a pyc or pyo file
08:37:54 <Camail> the first thing takes the pyinstaller .exe and give you the pyc
08:37:58 <Camail> or at least thats hwhat it says
08:38:17 <motbob> ya
08:38:24 <motbob> the pycs are a seperate thing
08:38:29 <motbob> they're basically the dependencies
08:38:41 <motbob> the parts of libraries that the original script used
08:38:47 <Camail> i was under the impression that the content of the pyz was the pyc
08:39:07 <Camail> oh
08:39:36 <Camail> well I'm way too tired to think about this
08:39:57 <Camail> hopefully you can get 1.1 but at least you have the worse version
08:40:10 <Camail> put it in dropbox >_>
08:43:01 <motbob> i spent my coffee high on this
08:44:03 <Camail> this seems to follow your pattern of misplaced productivity, tho
08:44:09 <Camail> so at least you're consistent
08:48:11 <motbob> i got out of bed 8 hours ago and I am crashing harder than I have EVER CRASHED

16:13:30 <skram> you fucboi
16:13:52 <skram> ok google tells me its a gateau
16:14:25 <Dot`> ooo
16:15:29 <skram> or a sponge cake
16:21:08 <Cane> So.
16:21:31 <Cane> I just remembered I dreamt that I was Lucio, wall running everywhere and shooting little slow moving things that did 5 damage.
16:21:50 <Cane> But since I was wallrunning nobody could hit me either, so it just turned into a very long showdown that felt like I was wading through honey.
16:22:14 <Cane> Then I got shot by Dot` for some reason, and I remember being angry because he wasn't even playing.
16:22:27 <Cane> I woke up wondering if I should buy Overwatch already.
16:22:33 <skram> Hahah
16:22:52 <skram> Its an accurate description of playing Lucio, cane
16:23:00 <skram> Besides the getting shot by Dot` part, of course
16:23:08 <Cane> Well sure, nobody gets shot by Dot`.
16:23:14 <skram> boom
16:23:15 <Cane> That may be why I was angry.
16:23:17 <Dot`> even in canes dream i dont play OW
16:23:25 <Dot`> wow cane.....
16:23:32 <Dot`> when you going to play cane?
16:24:03 <Dot`> maybe i dont play with you guys for a reason
16:24:04 <Cane> Was hoping for a sale, but it's Activision/Blizzard so it's unlikely to happen soon (or be a significant % off).

23:09:39 <Bio> hi cane
23:10:02 <Cane> So, a router near me exploded.
23:10:06 <Cane> Can you guys read this at all?
23:10:15 <Crisium> yes
23:10:16 <Bio> loud and clear
23:10:31 <Cane> Skype gone, Twitter gone, Reddit gone, TeamLiquid is fine and so is QuakeNet.
23:10:40 <Cane> Discord gone.
23:10:48 <Cane> And YouTube is fine. Goodie.
23:11:16 <Runbunny> I can say things to Dub?
23:11:32 <Runbunny> That boy is going to be so messed up.
23:11:36 <skrma> My router just crashed too, Cane.
23:11:36 <Phearlock> But yeah wow this dotepatch
23:11:38 <Phearlock> is sweet
23:11:41 <skrma> Thats an odd coincidence.
23:11:50 <Bio> lots of cool things
23:12:33 <Cane> skrma, huh.
23:12:44 <Cane> Norway hiccuped.
23:12:56 <Runbunny> Noes Norway!
23:13:13 <Crisium> the hive cluster is under attack
23:13:29 <Bio> You require more overlords
23:13:39 <skrma> Is there a subreddit where I can request music suggestions
23:13:54 <skrma> Like I want to listen to more songs like X regardless of genre
23:14:07 <Runbunny> probably.
23:14:30 <Runbunny> There might even be a bot online or like the spotify thingy.
23:14:59 <skrma> I tried the spotify thingy but it didnt exactly work
23:15:19 <DuBwork> musicmaze.fm is a thing, dunno if it's what you want.
23:16:28 <skrma> I want music that takes heavy use of vocoders
23:17:12 <skrma> Like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL-gyhZVvx0
23:17:55 <skrma> Or this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32kYH6XZrIo
23:19:38 <skrma> Actually that last one is probably something else
23:19:39 <skrma> hmm
23:25:10 <Dot`> skrammen
23:25:14 <skrma> yes
23:25:21 <Runbunny> Have you considered that you're making unreasonable demands?

23:30:12 <Cane> skram, I think the router is fucking with both of us. It happened again, didn't it?
23:30:19 <Cane> Suddenly my internet started hiccuping again and off you went.
23:31:30 <skram> Yeah
23:32:01 <Cane> Neat. Some server somewhere is probably dying and it's one both our ISPs connect to.
23:32:29 <Crisium> protoss wins again
23:32:36 <skram> Which is weird since we (probably) have different ISPs and we live like 1500 km apart
23:32:40 <Crisium> no zergs allowed in ASL
23:32:48 <Crisium> rip soulkey
23:33:43 <Runbunny> I didn't know that skram and cane were neighbours.
