15:31:11 <Phearlock> Draw a pony looking horribly guilty for doing something completely innocent.
15:31:19 <Micen> I have said no to that idea for just under 365 days now. What makes you think it will have changed now
15:32:01 <DoT|Phone> it's fun to ask
15:33:09 <Micen> also, it will be a year since I joined the IRC in 3 days
15:33:26 <Phearlock> Nice, I completely forgot what day I joined the channel on
15:33:28 <DuB`> !
15:33:41 <DuB`> I should go back and find my first post in the thread.
15:33:49 <Phearlock> But I know it's been enough years that I can say it's been several years.
15:33:54 <DuB`> I wonder if it's been four years.
15:33:58 <Micen> I checked when Fur and Blue started following me on Picarto, which also was the day I met Dot, and accused Fur of hiding pones who liked starcraft from me.

17:37:07 <Phearlock> It's what happens if you ship that giant moth and AJ from those random comics hard enough.
17:39:52 <Rawr|Fone> D:
17:42:59 <Phearlock> I do not ship them
17:51:40 <Micen__> But these pons are still cute. 
17:51:50 <Dot_> thats a lie phear, you ship everything
17:52:28 <Phearlock> No Dot there are some things I don't feel like shipping.
17:52:37 <Phearlock> These things are few and far between
17:52:40 <Phearlock> but they exist.
17:53:08 <Dot_> this is phear 
17:53:10 <Dot_> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Tc7MH5ZXbg
17:53:25 <Dot_> years of research show
17:53:34 <Phearlock> I did think "this better be that AMV" when I clicked it
17:53:38 <Phearlock> It was
17:53:47 <Phearlock> Good Dot
17:56:29 <Micen__> this could be Phear instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBgKP5erzWQ
17:56:36 <Micen__> but I think i like dots more
17:56:44 <Micen__> mine is actually depressing
17:58:03 <Dot_> but thats nopt about shipping is it?
17:59:47 <Micen__> no. 
17:59:59 <Micen__> but it has ships in the title and is sung by pony
18:02:49 <Phearlock> Dots is more accurate
18:02:51 <Phearlock> imo
18:03:53 <Micen__> I linked it more because anytime i see the word ships i start humming that

20:05:41 <Phearlock> Was afk, I think I did Cane, once.
20:05:45 <Phearlock> It's hard to remember
20:05:52 <Cane> Hah hi there.
20:06:00 <Cane> I was just reminded of it today. It had an amazing easter egg.
20:06:06 <carcinisation> dt on dt action :D
20:06:09 <Phearlock> Do tell =D
20:07:44 <Cane> There was a disgruntled employee named Servin who worked on SimCopter who decided that because of the allegedly horrible working conditions at Maxis, he was going to accept an offer he had been given by an outside group and add a little something to the game.
20:08:27 <Cane> So what he did was make it so that on certain days of the year, huge hordes of male strippers and bimbos who hugged and kissed each other on the streets would appear in place of the actual sims.
20:08:43 <Phearlock> Nice xD
20:08:45 <Cane> These "mimbos" had nipples that were rendered using the lighting FX, so you could see their glorious nipples from miles away.
20:09:05 <Cane> Because of a bug, these mimbos would crowd the user's helicopter, get cut up by their blades, and fall over unconscious.
20:09:20 <Phearlock> "unconscious"
20:09:33 <Phearlock> Very pokemon
20:09:44 <Cane> Actually yes, because when they crashed into you like that, they would fall over, and suddenly a mission would appear saying "accident has happened, take injured people to the hospital".
20:09:46 <Cane> And you could do it.
20:09:50 <Cane> It was the best way to earn money in that game.
20:10:01 <Cane> It got patched practically immediately, and future versions didn't have it.
20:10:07 <Cane> But the first version of SimCopter sure as hell had it.
20:11:16 <Phearlock> The only easter egg I know of in DCS is a star trek shuttle hidden inside one of the hangars in Area 51 on the nevada map.
20:11:43 <Cane> Oh that's awesome.
20:11:46 <Cane> The Nevada map in general looks great.
20:12:11 <Cane> I saw a video of a flight down the Las Vegas strip.
20:12:13 <Phearlock> Yeah, could still use some more content and actually having its client merged into the main one but, I'm sure they'll get there.
20:12:19 <Cane> Aye.
20:12:21 <Cane> Looking forward to it.
20:12:56 <Phearlock> Speaking of helicopters. The Huey is probably the best "manual" helicopter flight phyiscs model I've seen in a game.
20:13:18 <Phearlock> None of the FSX/X-plane/Arma ones have really come close to it.
20:13:32 <Cane> Yep. I've been flying it a ton over the past couple of weeks.
20:14:14 <Cane> There are some add-on helis for FSX/Prepar3D that come close, like the Dodosim 206 which I've had for FSX for a long time.
20:14:43 <Cane> It's superbly made, with a full start-up sequence that's modeled very well.
20:15:08 <Cane> The systems modelling is superb, but the flight model is not as good as the Huey.
20:15:33 <Phearlock> I love helicopter physics.
20:16:40 <Cane> Yeeeep.
20:17:07 <Cane> I also love that you can land on buildings in DCS World.
20:17:12 <Cane> Anything is a helipad if you're brave enough.
20:17:27 <Phearlock> I think my favorite is landing on moving ships in heavy turbulence/wind
20:17:43 <Cane> In FSX, you crash if one pixel of your helicopter touches one pixel of a tree leaf
20:17:57 <Cane> And in X-Plane you have noclip on permanently.
20:18:23 <Cane> I guess you technically can land on buildings and stuff in Arma 3 but I almost feel like it doesn't count.
20:18:36 <Phearlock> It kinda does but it varies.
20:20:51 <BioClass> I am the spleepiest pon
20:20:52 <Golly> i remember enjoying helis in the desert combat mod for bf1
20:20:59 <Bio> neighZ
20:21:04 <Phearlock> Those were super unrealistic and super fun.
20:21:16 <Phearlock> I approve of them
20:21:18 <Golly> pew pew
20:21:18 <Cane> Hahah yeah same here.
20:21:45 <Cane> I still love flying helis in BF4. It's all out arcade at this point but it's great entertainment.
20:21:47 <Cane> Things blow up pretty well. <3

21:14:36 <Dot_> but skram, i am watching sc2
21:15:16 <skram> Quiz is the kind of thing you do at a bar
21:15:17 <carcinisation> here quiz is more likely to be for fun e.g. pub quiz, quiz show
21:15:19 <skram> not in school
21:15:31 <DuB`> Tests are fewer and more important!
21:15:45 <DuB`> Quizzes are often every class / a few times a week, to check understanding.

21:16:25 <DuB`> no u
