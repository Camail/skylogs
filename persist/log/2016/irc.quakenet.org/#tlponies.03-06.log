05:27:08 <Camail> milk all the time
05:27:17 <Camail> i drink a lot of milk anyway so i always have it
05:27:56 <Micen> Milk.
05:28:02 <Micen> all the way. no question

05:32:06 <Phearlock> Nice motbob
05:45:47 <motbob> it's cool that the name "Team Secret" is a total accident
05:46:38 <motbob> a tournament organizer called them a "secret team" before the roster was announced. Then everyone started calling them Secret. Then someone made a logo

06:53:18 <motbob> hi bio, wecome to S H A N G H A I  M A J O R  F I N A L S
06:53:27 <DuB`> Heyo bayo.
06:53:48 <BioWork> the event that is littered with so many good memes
06:53:56 <Bio> I wonder if we will get one last one
06:54:47 <DuB`> Oooh, Liquid! :O
06:55:04 <DuB`> I hadn't been following it, didn't realize we made it this far.
06:55:05 <DuB`> Yay.
06:56:44 <DuB`> ... Won't have time to watch it, though.
06:56:47 <DuB`> Doto games too long.
06:58:18 <Bio> 1) DuB`. We've had issues with DuB` at previous events. Some IRC people lobbied to bring him back to #TLPonies, feeling that he deserved another chance. That was a mistake. DuB` is an ass, and we wont be pony posting with him again.
06:58:48 <DuB`> Oh dear.
06:59:26 <motbob> TL didn't ban lion
06:59:29 <motbob> interesting decision
07:00:03 <Bio> http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Thats-A-Bold-Strategy-Meme.gif
07:00:07 <motbob> i guess chen and enigma are good bans, i don't think either of their supports are known for their play on those heroes
07:02:40 <motbob> EE slark
07:03:08 <motbob> they leave EE's pick for last every time
07:03:18 <motbob> they pick for pld first most times
07:03:49 <motbob> that's a big deal in evaluating player performance
07:04:21 <motbob> if you leave a player's hero for last, they're not going to get their best hero for the situation
07:04:51 <motbob> so they're not going to look all that great. But if you pick for them first, you're probably getting their best hero, AND you're building the team around them to some extent
07:05:22 <motbob> So when people were praising PLD and... not praising EE yesterday, that could be a product of the pick order
07:06:36 <Bio> well, EE is mentally unstable

21:30:38 <Camail> dub why the fuck are you playing ff13
21:30:59 <Camail> that makes me angry FOR you
21:31:11 <DuB`> Um!
21:31:20 <DuB`> I played it like 4 years ago on ps3 and liked it.
21:31:26 <DuB`> Wanted to see what the other games were.
21:31:40 <Camail> they are famously awful
21:32:31 <Camail> for example
21:32:40 <Camail> this line of dialogue exists: http://55.media.tumblr.com/d9eff19a805b57587747529e51e924d0/tumblr_inline_ngloc18WlG1ru65t3.jpg

21:34:16 <Camail> i never finished any ff13
21:34:29 <Camail> at least dont play the last one
21:34:36 <Camail> I've watched it break people
