00:53:16 <Camail> headphones so hot
01:09:51 <Camail> rip tl
01:10:45 <DuB`> T_T
01:12:32 <Raelcun> wut?
01:13:05 <Phearlock> Finally got around to watching Zootopia
01:13:12 <Phearlock> Super loved it
01:13:17 <DoT`> gj phear
01:13:19 <Phearlock> What a nice movie
01:13:23 <DoT`> its great
01:16:45 <ZK> i loved zootopia too
01:22:14 <DuB`> It's next on my list.
01:22:30 <ZK> i want to see jungle book next
01:22:38 <DuB`> .tell runbunny I didn't realize 520 was scint for a while and he was super confusing me. :P
01:29:58 <ZK> computer so much faster since reinstalling windows 10
01:30:00 <ZK> feels so good
01:37:43 <DoT`> sluggish pc's are annoying
01:38:14 <ZK> i feel like i should get an ssd
01:38:57 <Crisium> it is awesome
01:39:10 <DoT`> you should, they are nice
01:39:11 <Crisium> most important component of a PC for general use
01:39:29 <Crisium> assuming you already have at least an i5 and a decent GPU for your gaming needs
01:40:50 <ZK> yea, i want to add some RAM and get an SSD
01:40:53 <DoT`> then install using USB 3, in the time it took me to type to a friend saying the install had started and mention having nothing to do it had finished
01:41:02 <DoT`> solved that problem
01:41:07 <FlutterAi> I got that get windows 10 app... ages ago :c W10 copy still reserved but it's not ready to update me to W10 for some reason.
01:41:27 <FlutterAi> feel like it's been almost a year
01:41:56 <DoT`> :/
01:43:10 <Phant> SSDs are the best.
01:43:16 <Phant> Never making a computer without them again.
01:44:04 <FlutterAi> if I ever have to upgrade my computer it might be worthwhile to add one.
01:45:00 <DuB`> "Might".
01:45:01 <DuB`> PLS
01:45:44 <Camail> SSD is best D
01:46:04 <Camail> get one with a 10 year warranty and ur covered
01:46:07 <Camail> 4ever
01:46:17 <Camail> most sandisk have long warranties
01:46:55 <DoT`> can you find a ssd without a 10 year warrenty nowdays?
01:47:14 <DoT`> from a non rubbish company
01:47:54 <Crisium> i got the samsung 850 evo, pretty sure its much less than 10 years, and is not considered rubbish
01:48:26 <Crisium> ya its only 5, the pro is 10
01:48:44 <Camail> confirmed rubbish ssd
01:48:50 <DoT`> when you get it?
01:49:00 <Camail> he got it out of a dumpster
01:49:07 <DuB`> Crisium your PC is made of rotten food and refuse.
01:49:10 <Camail> ^
01:49:11 <DuB`> Had you not noticed?
01:49:15 <Camail> basically a trash compactor
01:49:16 <DoT`> true trash
01:49:21 <DuB`> Hahahah
01:49:22 <Crisium> lol
01:49:35 <Crisium> should have gotten the 850 pro obviously
01:49:36 <Crisium> im scum
01:49:42 <Camail> TL won the half and won pistol
01:49:43 <Camail> yay
01:50:01 <DuB`> Nitro's perfect spray, though.
01:50:02 <DuB`> MMM.
01:50:10 <Camail> YOU ARENT ALLOWED TO CARE ABOUT CS
01:50:14 <DuB`> ACK.
01:50:17 <DuB`> But!
01:50:23 <Camail> butt
01:50:31 <DuB`> I have been playing for all of the last few days!!???
01:50:47 <DoT`> Crisium, i was saying in the past like year from what i gather, its all 10 year warrenties
01:50:52 <Camail> yet here you are unranked
01:51:01 <DuB`> Psh, who needs ranks.
01:51:02 <DuB`> I'm ready to try out for Fnatic.
01:51:04 <Crisium> na, 10 year is rare
01:51:08 <Crisium> most are 3-5
01:51:33 <Camail> the sandisk pro has 10 but thats my only experience because cyber monday sale
01:51:44 <DoT`> diffrent in america to au maybe
01:52:27 <Camail> ur america
01:52:50 <DuB`> Who needs wallhacks?
01:52:56 <DuB`> Not nitro!
01:53:08 <Crisium> ya the super high end "pro" models have 10, and tend to be slightly faster
01:53:19 <Camail> zoom
01:53:46 <ZK> looking at prices, probly go for a samsung
01:54:13 <ZK> gonna wait for first paycheck tho
01:54:20 <DoT`> yea, samsung are a nice quality too
01:55:55 <DuB`> I don't really like when commentators assume a played was "in a panic" or lacked compsure, etc.
01:56:06 <Camail> sandisk pros are cheaper than samsung pros
01:56:26 <Camail> same for the lower end versions
01:56:29 <Camail> dunno why
01:56:42 <Camail> probably some numbers somewhere in there that explain it
01:56:46 <Crisium> samsung pretty much owns the mindshare of the market so they get to dictate prices
01:56:47 <ZK> i just cheked samsung is the lowest pricepoint for all the ones i checked
01:56:57 <Crisium> interesting, they are often more expensive
01:56:58 <ZK> oh pros
01:57:04 <ZK> whats the difference with pro vs non pro?
01:57:17 <Camail> http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Plus-240GB-2-5-Inch-SDSSDA-240G-G25/dp/B00S9Q9VS4/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1463882145&sr=1-1&keywords=sandisk+ssd
01:57:20 <Camail> http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-2-5-Inch-Internal-MZ-75E250B-AM/dp/B00OAJ412U/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1463882130&sr=1-1&keywords=samsung+ssd+256
01:57:26 <Camail> sandisk is 20 cheaper
01:57:33 <Camail> for the non-pros
01:57:34 <Crisium> so 850 evo vs pro is pro has better components so it has a longer warrenty, and is slightly faster
01:57:41 <Crisium> i just said f it and got evo
01:58:01 <Camail> get a 2 tb ssd for 650 USD
01:58:05 <Camail> do it
01:58:19 <Crisium> with the technology improving, ill probably just get a new SSD every 5 years anyway just to get better speeds
01:58:35 <ZK> different for canadian prices
01:58:38 <Crisium> and more capacity
01:58:56 <ZK> oh wait, cheapest is kingston
01:58:56 <Crisium> mine is 1TB, so hopefully in 4 years i can get much more
01:59:03 <Camail> i depends on what exactly you want the ssd for
01:59:13 <Camail> if you just want it for the os then yea w/e
01:59:22 <Camail> it can be pretty small at that point
01:59:34 <DoT`> i just have a 250
01:59:35 <Camail> but being able to keep large programs on my C drive is nice
01:59:46 <DoT`> os + current games that need it
02:00:21 <ZK> i might put witcher on it with OS
02:00:25 <Crisium> i find that some games load waaaay faster, so thats why i got 1TB so i can put games on it too
02:00:38 <Camail> jesus no wonder you got an evo
02:00:43 <Camail> the price gap must've been quite large
02:01:33 <Crisium> at least $200+ difference, i dont remember exactly
02:02:23 <Camail> yea at 250gb its about a $40 diffrence for samsung
02:02:39 <Camail> so i was a bit curious why that price gap would be a big decision
02:03:01 <Camail> so do you have an hdd?
02:03:33 <Camail> lmfao nitro
02:03:39 <DuB`> ...?????
02:03:41 <Crisium> ya a 2TB HDD for storage
02:03:44 <Camail> he was so blind
02:03:53 <DuB`> "Don mind me, just going for a stroll."

03:18:41 <Camail> ugh I'm too fuckin nice, i dont want to kill anyone

03:18:56 <Camail> hopefully killing gets easier after the first one
03:19:53 <DuB`> ... uh oh.
03:21:15 <Camail> the question is
03:21:23 <Camail> do i kill someone i dont like to make it hurt less

03:35:57 <BioPhone> I bet
03:36:03 <BioPhone> I didn't know he worked on evolve
03:39:20 <Camail> yea, he worked at wotc at some point as well

03:39:51 <Camail> dont think he worked for them then, tho
03:47:12 <BioPhone> Huh, cool
03:48:04 <Camail> they split because supposedly the turtlerock devs didnt like valve dev cycles, aka "meh we'll get it done eventually"
03:51:14 <BioPhone> Sounds fair
03:52:40 <BioPhone> Evolve sounded like a fun game, at least for a little while
03:54:13 <Camail> yea there was a lot of bad PR with the dlc
03:54:20 <Camail> but the concept looked interesting

05:17:47 <Camail> ships
05:17:50 <Camail> is good trade
05:18:41 <Camail> oh man I'm excited, DMing was fun at first because i was learning a ton, then it got kinda unfun because it turned into just reading and setting up pre-made stuff, now I'm confident enough to alter it so fun is back!
05:18:47 <Camail> which doesn't bode well for you at all!
05:18:52 <Camail> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

05:49:29 <DuB`> This jerk!
05:49:35 <Camail> watch the vods
05:49:52 <Camail> there are some good ones
05:49:55 <Camail> and not so good ones
05:50:01 <Camail> and not so not so good ones
05:53:03 <DuB`> Ghettoest reaper, bahahah.
05:58:40 <DuB`> So far only girls seem even somewhat capable of cosplay.
06:08:53 <Camail> yea mostly
06:08:57 <Camail> but thats obvious korean bias
06:09:03 <Camail> who knows if they all made their own costumes
06:10:44 <Camail> there is a mei one that is pretty awful but you will 100% love
06:11:15 <Camail> i wonder what the overwatch version of jrui would be
06:11:19 <Camail> juri*
06:11:22 <Camail> would be really cool
06:11:29 <Camail> honestly dont change anything about her char design
06:11:34 <Camail> would work prefectly in game
06:11:47 <Camail> but having stored ranged weapons would be cool
06:13:11 <Camail> fighting game mechnics in non-fighting games is interesting
06:13:20 <Camail> even putting ryu in smash was interesting
06:14:22 <Camail> oh god i tohught playing a sniper was ahrd on rings of saturn
06:14:30 <Camail> turns out i have 0 idea how to play a big ship on that map
06:14:45 <Camail> they need to fix the top and bottom views, though
06:14:50 <Camail> make your ship a minimal wire frame
06:24:36 <DuB`> Oh yeah, hitting anything vertical to you is impossible.
06:24:45 <DuB`> Also the mei was pretty boring. >.>
