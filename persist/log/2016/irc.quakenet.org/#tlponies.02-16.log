00:00:24 <Camail> yea he still technically ate
00:00:31 <Runbunny> yeah
00:00:39 <Runbunny> He was even fed yeast.
00:00:41 <Camail> the longest recorded is 92 days
00:00:57 <Camail> at least, for a hunger strike
00:01:10 <Camail> most of his calories did come from his body tho
00:01:18 <Camail> (changing back to the subject)
00:01:30 <Camail> so its still impressive
00:02:07 <Runbunny> True. but doing a hunger strike I guess they didn't even get vitamins and stuff.
00:03:08 <Camail> yea
00:03:11 <Crisium> vpn is working now
00:03:13 <Crisium> i guess i was early
00:03:14 <Camail> the hunger strike is th elongest i could find
00:03:22 <Camail> which was actually consuming nothing
00:03:31 <Camail> what service did you use cris

02:14:08 <Camail> wonder how he got to consistant 
02:14:10 <Camail> before the release
02:14:12 <Camail> i wonder
02:14:21 <Crisium> he probably knows someone who had the early copy
02:14:54 <Camail> probably had an uncle who works for capcom that showed him some videos
02:15:59 <Camail> at least we get these matches tho
02:16:04 <Camail> before the shit show
02:16:10 <Crisium> tru dat
02:17:42 <Camail> wtf he used s.hp a few times
02:17:53 <Camail> then let myers control space with s.mk
02:17:55 <Camail> i dont get it
02:18:22 <Camail> if he gets a s.hp out anytime during those 4 s.mk's he gets a full combo
02:19:32 <Camail> damn
02:19:37 <Camail> that was sick

04:08:38 <Camail> 1hr until fighting time
04:10:02 <Crisium_> interview over
04:10:11 <Crisium_> he is either clueless or faking it
04:11:22 <Camail> i dont think he's smart enough to fake it
04:11:27 <Camail> i thought I would be happy
04:11:35 <Camail> but I'm jsut kinda sad
04:11:41 <Camail> its like, telling boyscouts about snipes
04:11:57 <Camail> its just a little bit cruel to do something to someone so naive
04:12:09 <motbob> STAY FREE JAPAN
04:12:27 <Camail> I'm really annoyed about that dp though
04:12:32 <Camail> like why was that beat
04:32:35 <Camail> Crisium_  so i was tihnking, because blocking takes 0 frames, even if you did a tool assisted neutral game footsies would still exist
04:32:58 <Camail> assuming both players knew pixel perfect ranges and frame data
04:33:22 <Crisium_> turn based fighter
04:33:26 <Camail> especially in sf4
04:33:30 <Camail> because i frames in backdashes
04:34:25 <Camail> jumping would be even more rare
04:34:42 <Camail> but technically a jump in can punish most sweeps
04:35:29 <Camail> i dont know if you can jump inr esponse tot he first frame of a sweep tho

04:53:43 <Camail> people keep saying that sf5 is gonna ahv a lot of counterpicks
04:53:49 <Camail> because its 16 characters
04:53:57 <Crisium_> maybe
04:54:33 <Camail> but its going up to 22 in a year
04:54:35 <Camail> so lolno
04:54:42 <Crisium_> i wonder which characters gonna have the worst MUs
04:54:55 <Crisium_> Dhalsim?
04:54:56 <Camail> sim vs someone
04:55:03 <Camail> he'll be the op one tho

05:18:38 <Camail> and it can happen to anyone
05:18:56 <Camail> be careful, it can happen to you
05:19:14 <Crisium_> well ya
05:19:21 <Crisium_> i suck
05:24:55 <Camail> also perfect spacing  for the slide makes it mostly unpunishable
05:46:54 <Crisium_> servers seem to be back
05:48:53 <Camail> ryu technically has a kara throw
05:48:59 <Camail> it sucks
05:49:01 <Camail> but he has one

06:16:12 <Camail> where is he getting his down charge
06:16:15 <Camail> its magic
06:16:34 <Crisium_> you sure that was it
06:17:06 <Camail> ya
06:18:00 <Camail> i think he's using the link buffering
06:18:16 <Camail> doing the s.mp on like, the first possible frame

06:24:14 <Camail> https://youtu.be/n4ZYm7hnpD0?t=56s
06:25:13 <Crisium_> ya thats crazy
06:28:39 <Crisium_> ah i just did it
06:28:46 <Crisium_> on cammy
06:28:57 <Crisium_> its very tight
06:31:59 <Crisium_> aaand i cant do it again ever now
06:34:34 <Camail> i cant get the down charge
06:34:48 <Camail> even if i break combo and wait
06:34:50 <Camail> so weird
06:36:53 <Crisium_> ah got it again
06:37:01 <Crisium_> twice out of like 40 tries lol
06:37:50 <Crisium_> gotta hold down the instant after you press mp, and you can delay the SBK slightly, dont cancel immediately wait
06:38:35 <Crisium_> servers are crap so im done for tonight, worn out from training rm anyway
06:42:53 <Camail> you can OS the sbk with mk legs anyway
06:43:08 <Camail> so if you get the sbk more damage, if you dont make charge thne you still finish the combo with something
06:43:10 <Camail> so there's that
06:43:43 <Crisium_> is that a real OS?
06:43:51 <Camail> yea
06:43:58 <Camail> tiger knee the input
06:44:07 <Camail> if you have the charge sbk take priority 
06:44:29 <Camail> I'm a lab monster cris i don't spout misinformation
06:44:54 <Crisium_> so 2369K still does legs?
06:45:01 <Camail> in a combo yes
06:45:03 <Camail> not raw tho
06:45:03 <Crisium_> didnt know it was that lenient
06:45:06 <Crisium_> ah
06:45:11 <Camail> shortcuts are still in
06:45:13 <Camail> dfdf is DP
06:45:27 <Camail> you can technically TK air legs
06:45:29 <Camail> its ahrd tho
06:45:42 <Camail> because of the height restriction you have to delay the button
06:46:14 <Camail> if you have the timing its more consitantly IA'd but if not you might not be doing it as low as possible
06:46:27 <Camail> but TK mk air legs is comboable
06:46:29 <Camail> which is cool
06:51:03 <Camail> cris  it actually OS's any time you aren't in neutral
06:51:13 <Camail> so reversal, block stun, hit stun
06:51:30 <Camail> jump will take priority over sbk
06:53:12 <Crisium_> floe doing that combo EZ right now lol
06:53:19 <Crisium_> wow
07:02:43 <Camail> jesus
07:02:48 <Camail> i dont know how
07:03:00 <Camail> I'm only letting my stick go to neutral por pressing the button
07:08:29 <Camail> this shouldnt be giving me problems, my execution is good =/
07:15:47 <Crisium_> haha floe
07:16:18 <Crisium_> finally gota  match and it dced before it could start
07:21:18 <Camail> LOOOOOOOL
07:21:20 <Camail> gets into a match
07:21:22 <Camail> starts fighting
07:21:24 <Crisium_> yup lol
07:21:24 <Camail> 20 second sin DC
07:21:28 <Camail> ripripriprip
07:21:30 <Crisium_> poor floe
07:21:35 <Crisium_> thats why i gave up trying
07:25:26 <Camail> I'm so mad
07:25:43 <Crisium_> cause chun combo?
07:31:48 <Camail> yea, i just cant find the window
07:31:53 <Camail> once i find it I'm good to go
07:32:06 <Camail> i should just picka  character with out charge
07:32:10 <Camail> i hate the mechanic anyway
07:32:35 <Crisium_> just replace it with a lesser combo for now
07:32:50 <Crisium_> ah floe got another match

07:36:27 <Camail> if you crouch right after you whiff a throw you mose forward
07:36:33 <Camail> move*
07:36:39 <Camail> like, your entire body
07:37:18 <Camail> so if you whiff a throw you can get thrown as a punish if you downback
07:37:37 <Camail> but not if you do anything else
07:37:41 <Crisium_> oh thats very useful info if true
07:37:57 <Crisium_> interesting

07:51:36 <motbob> http://i.imgur.com/CQIh9xf.png
07:51:39 <Camail> how do we report shit like this...
07:51:55 <Camail> also how the hell did this kinda of bug get into the game
07:52:20 <Crisium_> bug... or character unique feature
07:52:23 <Crisium_> Keepo
07:52:54 <motbob> it's part of Capcom's intricate balance design
07:53:12 <Crisium_> oh you posted it in the chat Camail, nice
07:53:29 <Camail> hopefully he tests it out
07:54:20 <Crisium_> i guess post it on SRK or email the Event Hubs ppl and they will make a story and give you credit OSfrog

07:57:23 <Crisium_> Camail is a lab scientist
07:57:32 <Camail> i asked pr rog
07:57:36 <Camail> and no one told hima bout it yet
07:57:41 <Camail> it might ahve existed since beta 1
07:57:55 <Crisium_> you can tweet combofiend
07:59:48 <Camail> i dont ahve social media
07:59:54 <Camail> you do it
08:00:17 <Crisium_> i dont tweet its for lamos
08:02:08 <Crisium_> and llamas
08:11:07 <Camail> I'm just running around trying to get streamers to test it out
08:11:13 <Camail> failing, so far
08:11:20 <Camail> everyone's obsessed with the servers
08:20:44 <Camail> Crisium_  uh oh
08:20:47 <Camail> this is a bit mor general
08:21:08 <Camail> for chun (and i assume the other few) its not jsut crouching
08:21:21 <Camail> its cancelling the recovery of the whiff throw into anything
08:21:36 <Camail> you can cancel the transiiton frames from whiff to idle for any characer
08:21:45 -!- Mag_ [~Mag@107.92-221-99.customer.lyse.net] has joined #tlponies
08:21:52 <Camail> but in these few, the point at which they cancel put the center point of the character forward
08:21:58 <Camail> its really weird
08:22:08 <Crisium_> dang
08:23:28 <Camail> technically
08:23:33 <Camail> it adds speed to their dash frowards
08:23:53 <Camail> chu's dash forward is kinda way better if you do it after a whiff
08:26:26 <Crisium_> lab scientist
08:26:30 <Crisium_> tell the world, not just me
08:26:33 <Crisium_> BE A SUPERSTAR
08:27:18 <Camail> I'm trying
08:30:06 <Camail> because this could be very important
08:31:57 <Camail> the only time you'll ever whiff a throw is when you're slightly out of range, so this is actually pretty bad for these characters. It opens you up to being thrown much more easily after a whiffed throw, which is gonna happen all the time if they are expecting the throw and go for a tech
08:32:06 <Camail> this is like, 90% of a bad thing
08:32:11 <Crisium_> post thread on SRK, that'll do it
08:32:48 <Crisium_> without video evidence it might take a while, but it just takes a few to figure it out and pass it on
08:46:31 <Camail> i threw it at event hubs
08:46:56 <Camail> I'm trying to make a video on it, but figuring out the best way tos howcase why it sucks is difficult to set yp

08:48:23 <Lynda> finished Mr. Robot season 1. 10/10 Breaking Bad level stuff
08:48:35 <Crisium_> whoa i liked breaking bad, never heard of mr robot
08:49:00 <Lynda> watch the pilot of Mr. Robot asap
08:49:13 <Crisium_> netflix?
08:49:18 <Crisium_> or i gotta torrent?
08:49:21 <Lynda> it's literally like Breaking Bad except with hackers instead of meth cooking
08:49:24 <Lynda> idk, I torrented
08:51:28 <Crisium_> ill check it out
08:54:43 <Lynda> yay :3
08:55:13 <Lynda> you'll be the 6th person then within a day whom I got into starting to watch it xD
08:55:35 <Lynda> fair warning: start watching at a time when you could comfortably marathon all 10 eps
08:55:37 <Lynda> it is very marathonable
08:56:54 <Lynda> one of my friends just stayed up all night to marathon it and now has to go to work so I take no responsibility for that :P
08:56:57 <Camail> Crisium_  ok so I'm testing it out and even though its like a full mini-square in the training room its kinda not making a difference
08:57:16 <Camail> its such  minute amount

08:58:12 <Crisium_> unless you lie :P
