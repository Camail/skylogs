00:35:57 <Camail> dot the banana controller was completely capacitive
00:36:08 <Camail> meaning he was totally running a current into a banana
00:36:22 <Camail> sadly the banana was not providing the current
01:00:22 <Dot_> yea, as i thought then
01:00:46 <Dot_> one day maybe cam we can have banana battries
01:01:03 <Camail> i dont think thats how molecules work, unfortunately
01:01:37 <Dot_> ONE DAY
01:01:53 <Dot_> once geneticly modified by runbun
01:02:11 <skram> mr engineer person Dot_
01:02:23 <skram> can you make a banana battery the same way you can make a potato battery
01:02:40 <skram> i have not worked with fruit so i have no experience in these matters
01:02:43 <Dot_> if you hide a battery inside
01:04:28 <Camail> nvm you can
01:04:37 <Camail> after 5 seconds of googling its a thing
01:07:56 <Dot_> hmm, time to make true banana controller then
01:08:05 <Dot_> gnight all

05:01:10 <Cane> Ok wow.
05:01:15 <Cane> SC2 is actually ded?
05:01:23 <Cane> 5 teams disbanded.
05:02:40 <Cane> Maybe Blizzard can keep things going for a while.
05:04:58 <Cane> Korean SC2 is in a bad place though.
05:06:07 <Cane> Whether it continues will likely be on the players and fans.
05:07:04 <Cane> SC/BW lost Proleague, but there are still tournaments, sponsors, and a lot of hype around ASL and such. Hopefully SC2 can find itself in a similar space.

13:58:22 <Dot_> oh dear
13:59:07 <Runbunny> Battlefield 1 look pretty fun... However it's EA and my innate hate for EA is pretty strong.
13:59:17 <Runbunny> also origin.
13:59:37 <Dot_> wait
13:59:51 <Dot_> it looks but but never worth the price
14:00:07 <Runbunny> really?
14:00:22 <Dot_> ?
14:00:52 <Dot_> do you have friends currently playin git and making you feel elft out?

14:04:26 <Runbunny> no
14:04:57 <Phearlock> yes
14:05:40 <Dot_> then runbunny, the 2 changes that will happen if you wait a bit are 1) game will come down in pice 2) bugs will get fixed
14:13:27 <Runbunny> Can it be fixed to not be EA?
14:13:48 <Dot_> all you can hope for is to give them as little money as possible
14:27:38 <Runbunny> Then that is none at all!

19:40:19 <Dot`> HELLO phear
19:41:42 <Micen|Droid> Excluding you all and my family, only 3 people took the time to wish me a happy birthday. No cake,  no presents (mostly because I got mine in August.) And also faced with the fact I'm a year older snd still havent done much. :/
19:42:38 <Dot`> heym 3ppl you know are actual friends, better than 200 facebook happy birthdays you know ppl are just doing out of habbit
19:43:06 <ZK> hey hey, i cherish those 57 happy brithdays i got from ppl i dont talk to ever
19:43:32 <Dot`> for that moment you where very close to them zk, there was a connection!
19:43:38 <Dot`> meaningfull and vast
19:44:04 <ZK> those like 10 minutes
19:46:19 <Dot`> I dont even have a facebook, ppl have to grovel and find me to wish me a happy birthday, all personal and stuff
19:46:45 <Micen|Droid> Its more my thinking that they saw and instead of reflexes kicking in they made a conscious choice to /not/ say happy birthday. 
19:47:38 <Micen|Droid>  I know thats my depression being so pessimistic, but it is hard to not think that way
19:50:06 <Dot`> micen, i have a gif for you
19:50:18 <Dot`> its almost a gift, but im too cheap

22:25:30 <Dot`> rawr
22:33:30 <Camail> my brother's co-worker has the best black-out drunk purchase ever
22:33:38 <Camail> he bought a corgi
22:33:46 <Camail> and he forgot he did
22:33:51 <Dot`> lol
22:33:53 <Camail> surprise corgi
22:39:08 <motbob> like.. online?
22:39:52 <motbob> that's potentially really sad
22:40:59 <Dot`> well the guy also didnt notice a fair amount of money vanished form his account to get a dog
22:42:35 <Dot`> http://bugplayer.deviantart.com/art/The-house-of-the-rising-chill-640856599
22:49:51 <Phearlock> cute!
22:57:35 <Camail> there's like a 99% chance it came from a puppy mill
22:57:47 <Camail> but now he has a corgi and everything's fine
22:58:25 <Camail> It is all legitimate, all the normal paperwork and medical stuff
22:59:07 <Camail> miiight not be ethical
22:59:40 <Camail> but damn if a corgi cant somehow override my feelings of doubt
23:00:16 <Dot`> i require picture of corgi, as i do of all dogs
23:00:32 <Camail> that requires attaching my phone to my computer
23:00:35 <Camail> i will later
23:01:08 <Phearlock> that is a great story camail
23:02:19 <Camail> its better when told in person
23:02:50 <Camail> or anything not typing
23:10:36 <Runbunny> for you Dot` http://imgur.com/gallery/ZE7Ym
23:11:03 <Dot`> mercy!
23:22:34 <Camail> dot i won a 1v1 mercy battle but then a torb shot me
23:22:41 <Dot`> RUDE
23:22:54 <Camail> it was a more complicated altercation but thats the most important part
23:22:54 <Dot`> that was between mercys
23:23:34 <Camail> genji alted, i ran and ressed, killed the genji, she jumped in and ressed, we fought like men, then torb ruined everything
23:23:37 <Camail> ulted*
23:23:44 <Dot`> haha
23:27:15 <Camail> one of these days someone is gonna realize how much damage her gun does and figure out how to use it really well
23:35:02 <Dot`> .tell Bio http://momomistress.deviantart.com/art/Fair-and-Faithful-640891314
23:35:22 <Phearlock> Bestship <3
23:36:22 <Dot`> phear pls, there is nothing innately shippy there
23:36:54 <Phearlock> I am making a deduction
23:37:03 <Phearlock> Based on artist previous works
23:37:07 <Phearlock> It might be wrong
23:37:48 <Camail> "I started a new blog for these two + other royals and shipping of course"
23:38:07 <Dot`> but there is nothgin shippy in that picture though
23:38:25 <Runbunny> Dot`, the last one http://i.imgur.com/pD6YJUH.png
23:38:27 <Runbunny> So good.
23:38:35 <Phearlock> They don't have to be cuddling and kissing all the time to be shipped dot
23:38:38 <Dot`> haha angel
23:38:50 <Phearlock> If that was a requirement the poor couples would never get anything done
23:38:54 <Dot`> apparently they just have to stand near eachother
