00:18:36 <motbob> In the year 2099...
00:18:40 <motbob> Humanity has spread throughout the solar system...
00:18:47 <motbob> With the help of AI and cybernetics, humans have modified themselves in order to survive on the harsh environments of different planets.
00:18:56 <motbob> This has led to the effective creation of different "races" of humans, each with their own identity and frightening strength.
00:19:03 <motbob> With tensions rising between the different factions, a way to resolve political differences was needed.
00:19:10 <motbob> And so, each race of humans send a team of representatives to a neutral location above the surface of the sun, where they will compete in: CYBERSOCCER 2099.

21:47:41 <Camail> the new doom mimics the old game design style in some important ways
21:47:50 <Camail> namely, how easy it is to break it to speedrun
21:48:02 <Camail> doom is a broken ass game
21:48:45 <Dot_> yay

22:23:58 <Camail> probably like 50 years
22:24:09 <Runbunny> No way O:
22:24:30 <Camail> according to the avg male life span
22:24:31 <Camail> yea way
22:24:38 <skram> you ok anders?
22:25:29 <Runbunny> Yeah.
22:26:12 <Runbunny> I just had to check a lot of stuff since my coworker was like "you're not getting your full pay" when in fact I was.
22:26:57 <Dot_> awww
22:27:03 <Dot_> such hope to get dashed
22:27:22 <Runbunny> it more like grief.
22:28:21 <Camail> as in, for a bref second you thought you were being screwed over?
22:28:23 <Camail> brief*
22:29:27 <Runbunny> it was more like I didn't check the numbers and her math was a bit off.
22:29:40 <Runbunny> it was just annoying.
22:31:36 <Camail> only one solution
22:31:37 <Camail> kill her
22:32:29 <Camail> oh dot i found a replacement for ponycountdown if they end up being dead forever (which is doubtful)
22:32:39 <Camail> sad i never heard of tvmaze before all this
22:32:50 <Camail> its just a huge database of tv shows
22:33:22 <Camail> with a super simple api and super simple json objects
22:33:46 <Dot_> cool
22:38:16 <Runbunny> I have to sleep though
