01:45:17 <DuB`> Bio, I did say "910 is the bottom .5% of all players on masteroverwatch... ouch"
01:45:32 <skram> I had to go to one of our smaller furnaces downtown to fiddle with some buttons, and i had to take a piss so I had to go to the abandoned offices
01:45:35 <skram> S C A R Y
01:45:47 <DuB`> Spoopy.
01:45:57 <Bio> he is the .5%
01:46:11 <DuB`> Kinda like when I have to close up alone and go turn out all the lights in the old math building.
01:46:27 <DuB`> Maze-like and not many windows, creaky elevator, etc.

16:57:39 <Cane> Hi folks. <3
17:02:50 <Dot> Hey cane <3
17:02:58 <Dot> are you still adventuring in the zone?
17:07:55 <Cane> Dot, I actually completed my freeplay playthrough of Call of Chernobyl.
17:08:27 <Cane> I turned on story mode when I started the character, which takes most of the story missions from all the games and puts them in.
17:09:23 <Cane> I finished exploring all the underground X-19 style bases, found the documents, and did the "endgame" thing where you deactivate the C-C's generators.
17:09:36 <Dot> nice
17:09:55 <Cane> I have all the artifacts (and unique ones such as Oasis, Compass), have the weapons and armor I want fully upgraded, have most of the achievements (except one that's easy to get)...
17:10:00 <Cane> I had fun. It was mostly stable.
17:10:01 <Dot> i recall a few sore people when they foud out they had got a false ending haha
17:10:12 <Cane> lol but it was so obvious.
17:10:17 <Dot> i know >.>
17:10:27 <Dot> and you have to AVOID the second quest
17:10:31 <Dot> line
17:10:35 <Cane> Yes!
17:10:51 <Cane> Call of Chernobyl actually improved on the Wish Granter thing.
17:11:20 <Cane> For every wish they made the game do certain things that screwed you.
17:11:54 <Cane> "I wish for all the riches in the zone" would give them to you, but make you unable to drop anything so you'd die standing next to the wish granter.
17:12:01 <Dot> i only finished CoC once i tihnk, almost did a second time, but ended up in the final area with no health and  a save corruption meaning my last save was hours back
17:12:09 <Cane> Aw that sucks.
17:12:24 <Cane> I definitely made tons of saves as I played.
17:12:31 <Cane> Since I was afraid of that happening.
17:12:52 <Dot> it was a stupid quick save thing where i got into the bad habit of using it a lot
17:13:05 <Cane> The second I talked to Doc in the swamp and got all the story missions, I just went "oh god, oh no" because it FILLED my PDA with like 20 quests.
17:13:08 <Cane> Which can be bad for your save game.
17:13:20 <Dot> haha
17:13:31 <Cane> Dot, in Call of Chernobyl you can set the number of quicksaves you use.
17:13:38 <Cane> I thought by default it was even 5.
17:13:42 <Cane> Are you talking about Shadow?
17:13:44 <Dot> I am busy playing Ground control 1 atm, so old, so good
17:13:59 <Dot> Shadow i finshed at least twice
17:14:09 <Dot> CoC i only finished once
17:14:11 <Cane> Oh snap, Ground Control was good.
17:14:16 <Dot> ikr?
17:21:37 <Dot> GC2 was okay but I really like the 1 drop at the start and make it work
18:13:30 <DoT|Phone1> still no Skram

18:30:39 <Cane> Best special edition of a video game I have ever seen.
18:31:10 <Cane> The copyright holders apparently decided to rescue the old Street Rod PC games from being abandonware and released a "special edition" version for free.
18:33:12 <Cane> Time to fire up DOSBox and have some nostalgia.
