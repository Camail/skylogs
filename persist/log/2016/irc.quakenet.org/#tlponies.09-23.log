21:09:39 <skram> Yeah! Thats Phearlock_s job.
21:09:47 <Phearlock_> Yeah! Wait
21:10:05 <Bio> hors feel
21:17:31 <Camail> skram its even weirder when your headphones are fucked and you can only hear a half the frequencies
21:17:44 <Camail> its basically like if instead of people singing you had ghosts singing
21:18:08 <Camail> or someone is singing it in the next room over
21:18:42 <skram> that sounds like an improvement
21:20:55 <Dot`> i feel distaste
21:21:36 <Camail> skram's favorite hobby is hating music
21:22:05 <Camail> anyway
21:22:06 <skram> yup
21:22:10 <Camail> lets fuckin play
21:22:13 <skram> love this song because it makes me fucking livid
21:22:15 <Camail> LETS FUCKIN DO SOMETHIN
21:22:32 <Camail> I'm not saying that every emotion you have is hate, its just your favorite
21:22:39 <Camail> mine is disappointment, yours is hate
21:22:45 <Camail> we're like the fucked up carebears
21:22:48 <Camail> dot's is fear
21:22:55 <Camail> bio's is sadness
21:23:10 <Camail> zound's is frustration
21:23:26 <skram> if sodomy was an emotion, that would be phearlock
21:23:34 <Camail> lust is close enough
21:23:48 <skram> that would be more apropos anyway i feel
21:25:53 <Bio> oi m8
21:25:59 <Camail> wow die antwoord has a youtube video with full frontal nudity
21:26:06 <Camail> why doe this not have 50m views already
21:26:25 <skram> well because yolandi is kinda creepy
21:26:55 <Camail> yea but its 16 seconds and its not even her
21:28:19 <Camail> I feel like they are either gonna break up and die within 2 years of each other, or live until 100

23:31:43 <Camail> see
23:31:46 <Camail> i was right
23:32:08 <Camail> rawr is drunk more times than any of us our having our trademarked emotion
23:32:12 <Camail> is he our king
23:34:01 <Rawr|Fone> Yes
23:34:17 <skram> not true
23:34:37 <skram> Im always angry camail
23:34:49 <Camail> no, anger doesnt mean hate
23:34:56 <Camail> hate is much more pure and focused
23:34:58 <skram> oh right
23:35:11 <skram> I thought anger was my element
23:35:21 <Rawr|Fone> No
23:35:27 <Rawr|Fone> It's much more
23:35:38 <skram> shit are we like a R rated captain planet thing
23:35:46 <Rawr|Fone> I hope so
23:35:51 <Camail> we summon a giant autonomous cock
23:35:58 <Camail> just lays there
23:35:59 <Camail> seeping
23:36:01 <skram> its the best kind
23:42:29 <Camail> if i made a plugin for sweetie that let you put yourself into and take yourself out of a list of people currently willing to stack, would we want that
23:43:05 <Camail> I'd like to facilitate tlp stacks, so I'm throwing that out there
23:43:09 <Camail> it'd be easy to do
23:43:48 <Camail> .who
23:43:58 <Camail> that's free, good
23:52:21 <Camail> twitch added a new emote
23:52:22 <Camail> prime
23:52:27 <Camail> all lowercase
23:52:37 <Camail> because that word is never used, ya know
23:52:51 <Camail> its not like there's a classic game with that word in its name
23:52:59 <Camail> and its not like this is a gaming stream service
23:53:09 <Camail> or that it isn't just a fucking normal word
