22:35:56 <Cane> Share my pain Dot`.
22:44:52 <Camail> cane twitch is a dumb and decided to make every API call require an ID
22:45:00 <Camail> which is why swoots doesnt work with twitch  links anymore
22:45:03 <Cane> wat
22:45:07 <Cane> That is a dumb
22:45:10 <Dot`> poor swoots
22:45:12 <Cane> Why did they a dumb Cam?
22:45:36 <Camail> I mean, it helps protect themselves from assholes and bad coders
22:45:49 <Camail> because lul accident an infinite loop with a url request
22:46:23 <Camail> I just need to get my ID and put it in the header but that means figuring it out on my machine, then getting it on the vps
22:46:41 <Camail> which I am 100% sure there is an easy way to do that i never learned on github but yea
22:46:43 <Cane> ug. Are you gonna bother?
22:46:49 <Camail> eventually
22:47:08 <Cane> I appreciate you maintaining Sweetiebot so I don't have to. You're better at it than I would be.
22:47:46 <Camail> meh its just the occasional restart when she blows up
22:47:59 <Camail> the only effort is making new stuff or shit kind of thing
22:48:05 <Camail> which i did for youtube last year, anyway
22:48:12 <Cane> Oh, well I take it back then, clearly you don't do anything useful around here.
22:48:20 <Camail> ya fuck off appreciating me
22:48:23 <Camail> I dont need confidence
22:48:24 <Cane> That's my fault
22:49:10 <Camail> now that youtube have a repeat function I don't need friends
22:51:38 <reification> you could finish the .stack function cam or have you already done it?
22:52:10 <Dot`> i blame dub
22:52:16 <Camail> i havent done it yet, should probably do that now
