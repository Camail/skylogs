04:51:12 <Bio> hi cam
04:51:22 <Camail> yo
04:51:23 <Bio> I got carried in my second game
04:51:26 <Bio> so yey
04:51:28 <Camail> nice
04:51:40 <Camail> took so data, hopefully isp will be helpful
04:51:42 <Camail> some*
04:52:00 <Camail> but until then i actually cant play any games
04:52:11 <Camail> that game would have been doable on nuke if i could play
04:52:19 <Camail> the other 3 sucked so bad
04:52:27 <Camail> "omg so many angles to check"
04:52:35 <Camail> even though half the angles were removed
04:52:43 <Camail> literally
04:53:10 <Camail> did they force you to play it out or did they surrender
04:53:26 <Bio> forced
04:53:44 <Bio> I kinda just ran outside every round
04:53:59 <Bio> to take the bot
04:54:11 <Bio> but they were faster at deding
04:55:55 <Bio> such is life
04:56:04 <Bio> need moar prac
04:56:06 <Bio> on nuke

05:13:35 <Camail> 3 or 4 shot bursts and its ez
05:14:30 <Camail> honestly though, go into an offline server and just walk around
05:14:39 <Camail> I did that for a few minutes beforehand, timed a few things
05:14:42 <Camail> checked a few angles
05:14:51 <Camail> didnt take me as long because I already know original nuke fairly well
05:15:14 <Camail> and the ppl I play with love nuke so much we've played it a bit sicne it was taken out of comp play
05:16:04 <Camail> there's actually two ways onto twinkie
05:18:01 <Camail> note the changes, think about what the implications are, it begins to make sense
05:18:32 <Camail> the most obvious thing to think about as t is how to approach the site, and why that was buffed
05:20:10 <Camail> they added more to catwalk, which means T's can take outside and hit inner from every angle
05:20:47 <Camail> they reduced vents to 1, and connected toxic to secret, so its easier tot ake and easier to hold
05:21:27 <Camail> inner guys cant rotate as easily to b site and get two free angles from vents, you can have one guy dedicated to vents now and shut it down
05:27:56 <Bio> yeah
05:28:03 <Bio> lots of stuff to think about
05:29:18 <Camail> its also important to understand why they took out the 2 vents they did, why its a diagonal now
