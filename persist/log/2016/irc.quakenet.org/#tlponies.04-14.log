16:09:01 <carcinisation> hello runningbun
16:09:37 <Runbunny> Others have claimed that you don't care Jonas. Is there truth in this?

20:42:24 <Rawr|Fone> Not very hard
20:42:34 <DoT`> huzzah! easy wins
20:42:59 <DoT`> have to teach them to loose well
20:44:24 <Rawr|Fone> It's way harder than I thought to teach people how to play
20:44:44 <Rawr|Fone> I don't remember being as unresponsive as all of these kids are
20:44:50 <Rawr|Fone> But I probably was
20:51:19 <Rawr|Fone> Camail how do I choose who I want to play in street fighter
20:52:04 <Camail> you have to go into fight request settings, then battle settings, then choose your favourite character
20:52:11 <Camail> its kinda dumb
20:52:39 <Rawr|Fone> No, I'm talking about just deciding on a character
20:52:47 <Rawr|Fone> I don't know who I want to play
20:54:16 <DoT`> pick the best one rawr
20:54:26 <DoT`> who is a wizard
20:54:55 <Rawr|Fone> Ok
20:54:59 <Rawr|Fone> I will
20:55:18 <Phearlock> Isn't everyone with some sort of magical projectile a wizard?
20:55:36 <Runbunny> but phearlock what if they are a mage?
20:55:42 <DoT`> does any of the characters have a wizard hat?
20:55:47 <Runbunny> or sorceror ?!?!

20:56:18 <Bio> then back to onlywatch
20:56:26 <Camail> has anyone made a crack so you can play offline
20:56:37 <Bio> idk
20:56:38 <DoT`> LOL
20:56:39 <Rawr|Fone> I did the story thing with all of them
20:56:56 <Rawr|Fone> But I don't really know how they play from that
20:57:36 <Camail> hmm
20:58:33 <Rawr|Fone> Maybe I should just play ryu for now and decide something later
20:59:24 <Camail> ok, let's say you're in a scramble situation, is your first reaction to take advantage of the chaos or  do nothing and react to what they are doing
20:59:45 <DoT`> well rawr i looked, and non have a wizard hat
20:59:50 <Camail> ryu isn't strictly as vanilla as in sf4
20:59:53 <Bio> my reaction is panic
21:00:24 <Rawr|Fone> Probably the second one
21:02:36 <DoT`> Yolteotl, https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/4esx4z/official_ruling_on_wcs_wintrading/
21:02:41 <Camail> when you're doing anything competative, lets say table tennis, do you like being agressive, always trying to figure out a way to be on the offensive and force your opponent to make mistakes or make defensive guesses
21:02:47 <Camail> there are two other otions coming
21:02:50 <Camail> options*
21:03:05 <DoT`> lol, blizzard has access to replays and can see chats, what a supprise :P
21:03:50 <Camail> another option is letting them hang themselves, you have strong defense and a cool head and let them make mistakes
21:04:29 <Camail> keep in mind a good player does all of this stuff, but the overarching style will make someone lean towards one or the other
21:04:56 <Camail> judging by the way you played ryu in sf4 I'd say you like zoning, space control, and dictating the pace by slowing it down
21:05:01 <Camail> tho that was years ago
21:05:18 <Camail> I think you like fireballs
21:05:32 <Camail> which makes tihs both easier and harder
21:05:34 <Camail> this*
21:06:06 <Rawr|Fone> I am one of the only defensive players remaining in table tennis cam
21:06:30 <carcinisation> the great wall of rawr
21:06:37 <Camail> yea figured
21:06:50 <Camail> lemme pull up the character list and get a beter idea
21:09:03 <Camail> so its either chun li, ryu, nash, or dahlsim
21:09:41 <DoT`> be a monk!
21:09:52 <Camail> the last 3 all have solid fireballs, sim is complicated because his fireball is an anti-air
21:09:59 <Rawr|Fone> I kind of enjoyed dahlsim, but I don't know if he is a good character to start with
21:10:09 <Camail> and they way hs limbs work are actually pre-emptive and rather agressive
21:10:27 <Camail> he has to keep people out and constantly make good decisions, not great, but they have to be good
21:10:50 <Camail> he'll be easy to win with at first
21:11:29 <Camail> he has the highest air mobility because of hovering, teleports and his dive kick. He's pretty complex but that's not that bad
21:11:48 <Rawr|Fone> I'll try it out
21:12:40 <Camail> the problem you will face right out the gate is when to hit buttons on the ground and when to hit buttons in the air
21:12:42 <DoT`> boop de snoot rawr
21:12:47 <Camail> he doesn't really play footsies
21:12:56 <Camail> well, traditional fotsies
21:13:00 <Camail> footsies*
21:14:23 <Camail> you should try all 4
21:15:05 <Camail> spend a few hours with each of them, get used to the buttons and their move speed
21:16:00 <Camail> training room helps
21:16:06 <Camail> nash is really fun
21:16:44 <Rawr|Fone> I'll try them
21:16:45 <Camail> is you properly space his mk scythe its safe so he gets a ton of space control
21:16:48 <Camail> if*

21:24:22 <Camail> the pc port wasnt the best
21:24:23 <DoT`> rawrasaur cant spell his name
21:24:29 <Camail> you have to go into an engine.ini file to do it

21:36:59 <Camail> nope
21:37:01 <Camail> all pasison gone
21:37:03 <Camail> down the drain
21:41:40 <DuB`> Or I could just skip the rest of my exams and go pro in slither.io
21:41:48 <DuB`> Just discovered that, good times.
21:42:48 <DoT|Phone> dub
21:42:52 <Camail> its pretty good, but gets kinda boring once you're in top 10
21:43:10 <DuB`> Yeah, I got there twice.
21:43:12 <Camail> like, you have a ton of space control but you are always just doing that
21:43:15 <Camail> you cant play agressive
21:43:21 <Camail> or else the small guys will just fuck you
21:43:21 <DuB`> You can just use your own body as a safe zone.
21:43:24 <DuB`> Yep yep
21:43:50 <Camail> but its soooo boring
21:43:59 <Camail> and thne you lose all your space control when you coil up to be safe
21:44:17 <Camail> they should tighten up the turn radius on massive sankes a bit
21:44:56 <DuB`> Had a few lag spikes, too.
21:45:13 <DuB`> Dash in front of a guy for an easy kill, but then find myself ramming his side a second later.
21:45:38 <Camail> yea thats why I only do like 45 degree cuts
21:46:01 <Camail> oh the BEST part of the game tho? eating a corpse from one end and lady and the tramp'ing with another guy
21:46:11 <Camail> but then making him die
21:46:17 <Camail> and you get double corpse, yeaaaa
21:46:37 <DuB`> I love the bloodbath whenever a big guy dies.
21:46:49 <Camail> one time i just respawned, found a corpse and ate most of it, baited with the rest of it
21:47:06 <Camail> killed two people fighting for it, then baited with all that
21:47:11 <Camail> complete luckfest was me
21:47:20 <DuB`> I think my best moment was being the outside of a triple constrictor circle.
21:47:33 <Camail> i never go for those
21:47:53 <DuB`> If the inside has a decent size they can just live forever, yeah.
21:48:07 <Camail> i do like maybe 3 loops
21:48:16 <Camail> sometimes they just give up
21:48:19 <DuB`> Mhm
21:48:25 <Camail> I give people a lot of opportunities to make mistakes
21:48:38 <Camail> I got up to rank 2 once, was so mad
21:48:40 <Camail> I was so close
21:48:46 <DuB`> Nice
21:48:49 <DuB`> !
21:48:51 <Camail> but i got bored and went for a risky play
21:48:56 <DuB`> 20k or so?
21:48:58 <Camail> as with all of my top 10 finishes
21:49:08 <Camail> yea like 19.5k or something
21:49:15 <Camail> #1 had maybe 26k
21:50:18 <Camail> you can get really far by just avoiding risk and finding scrambles
21:50:55 <Camail> 1v1s are incredibly boring and ultimately impossible to win if both people play carefully
21:51:58 -!- FlutterAi [~FlutterAi@adsl-98-93-49-127.owb.bellsouth.net] has joined #tlponies
21:53:10 <Camail> I found the strongest play a big snake can make though
21:53:35 <DuB`> :O
21:53:57 <Camail> if you are being threatened, do a single circle  in the opposite side of them
21:54:10 <Camail> it puts you behind them which you would think is bad
21:54:51 <Camail> but you not only use your own body as defense, but you are using minimal space so you dont lose space by overlapping a lot, and you dont have to risk them attacking with the head
21:54:58 <Camail> you already know where their body is going
21:55:12 <Camail> as long as they aren't trapping you this will always get you out of trouble
21:55:31 <Camail> it works for most sizes unless the size difference is skewed heaivly towards the enemy
21:56:28 <Camail> and I'm beginning to think that  once you re big you should always avoid a certain density of snakes and rely entirely on own scrambles
21:56:44 <Camail> if like 4 people are going at a 10k corpse you can literally swallow all of them
21:56:47 <Camail> it feels so good
21:57:02 <Camail> on owning scrambles*
22:13:41 <Camail> omg
22:13:43 <Camail> this fucker
22:13:48 <Camail> was literally in my body
22:13:50 <Camail> and he didnt pop
22:14:02 <Camail> the lag problems are subtle but KILLER
22:14:21 <Camail> meet me at lan faggot
22:14:23 <Runbunny> dying to lag is the worst though
22:21:23 <Camail> DuB`  died to boredom again
22:21:26 <Camail> siiiigh
22:21:49 <Camail> well at least top 10 deaths create a fun fuckfest 
22:22:22 <Camail> i died boosting to challenge for like 100 points
22:22:42 <Camail> because at that point everyone is either avoiding you or trying to get the cheap kill
22:23:24 <Camail> oh i found another amazing tactic
22:23:32 <DoT`> my mouse went out the window so didnt turn
22:23:33 <Camail> if you are ever in a scramble dont start eating like crazy
22:23:43 <Camail> divide the corpse up
22:23:49 <Camail> then go back inside and eat the parts
22:23:58 <Camail> this works exponentially well the bigger you are
22:25:18 <Camail> i wish the entire game was just graveyard fights
22:25:27 <Camail> instead of wondering around looking for kills
