21:45:13 <Rawr|Fone> I am home
21:45:54 <Rawr|Fone> Dot did you look at battlerite
21:47:19 <Dot`> i had a quick look, could be fun when out
21:50:54 <Rawr|Fone> Out of other options?
21:57:10 <Dot`> hmmmm
22:05:22 <Rawr|Fone> Please dot
22:05:32 <Rawr|Fone> This is priority #1
22:15:52 <Dot`> sorry had to afk
22:16:12 <Dot`> i didnt see any competition for keys on
22:35:42 <Camail> so pokemon uranium came out, and the unofficial fan game's official devs got hit with the DMCA so they cant work on the game anymore
22:35:51 <Camail> so now there are unoficial devs working on it
22:36:00 <Phearlock_> lol
22:36:05 <Dot`> haha
22:36:14 <Camail> so the official devs of the unofficial fan game left sot he unofficial devs for the unofficial fangame can do w/e they want
22:36:31 <Camail> RIP nintendo
22:36:41 <Camail> THIS is how you make a fangame
22:36:49 <Camail> you literally cannot stop this kind of creation
22:59:38 <Camail> its a fun fan game
23:00:24 <Phearlock_> Thanks for the heads up on it being released though
23:00:38 <Phearlock_> Wouldn't mind some more pokemans
23:02:42 <Camail> you have to go to the subreddit to get the info for the patching server, tho
23:02:55 <Camail> because the default is the one given by the original devs and is no longer up
23:03:27 <Camail> also sf5 is almost finished, 6 months after being released
23:03:27 <Camail> sigh
23:03:55 <Camail> all this shit they got would've been solved if they just branded it as a competitive edition and held the full release
23:10:20 <Camail> Dot`  this game looks like dreadnought
23:20:29 <Phearlock_> It's a lot like it lol
23:20:36 <Phearlock_> Gave it a shot, played a few hours
23:20:57 <Phearlock_> Plays fairly similar. Map is a bit more moba-like
23:26:34 <Phearlock_> No engine/sheld/weapon power thing but a few more abilities per craft generally. Basic shippy combat works on firing arcs of weapons and armor being locational (get hit too much on one side and you start taking more damage on that side)
