01:27:05 <motbob> we have 1,000,000 fruit flies
01:29:25 <Camail> where do you put them
01:46:28 <motbob> that makes me wonder what 1,000,000 fruit flies would actually look like
01:46:38 <motbob> would they all fit in the apartment? I think so
01:48:50 <Camail> 3mm x 2mm
01:48:57 <Camail> that seems easily mathable
01:49:01 <motbob> one million fruit flies, by my calculations, would fit in a 0.14 ft^3 box
01:49:10 <motbob> what this is telling me is that my calculations are shit
01:49:10 <Camail> especially if you crush them
01:49:14 <motbob> let me try again
01:50:38 <motbob> wow, i don't think my calcuations were shit
01:50:50 <motbob> fruit flies are just that small
01:51:29 <motbob> so the answer to your question is: I keep them in this envelope box on my desk
01:54:44 <Camail> that would be noisy for awhile
01:54:48 <Camail> then pretty silent

02:46:25 <motbob> gonna go check on my fruit fly trap
02:46:34 <motbob> today was the first time I ever heard fruit fly buzzing
02:46:39 <Camail> is your goal 1 million
02:46:53 <Camail> sometimes i forget i put fruit in an open trash can
02:47:00 <Camail> then i get reminded by nature and htrow it away
02:50:00 <motbob> the trash can was closed
02:50:08 <motbob> but apparently not closed enough
02:50:24 <motbob> update: my entire house smells like vinager
02:50:51 <motbob> it's questionable whether that's worth the death of 15 fruit flies (so far)
02:50:58 <motbob> I will let it sit overnight
02:56:08 <Bio> fruit flies are awful
03:03:07 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry
03:03:44 <Camail> i figured out a way to have fun with someone who is bad at fighting games:
03:03:48 <Camail> pick 1 good thing and do it
03:03:52 <Camail> over and voer forever
03:03:57 <Camail> until they figure out how to deal with it
03:04:10 <Camail> also juri is so fun
03:04:21 <Camail> .tell dub` JURI IS SO FUN
