00:14:43 <carcinisation> night all
00:16:18 <Dot`> gnight reif
00:26:59 <Crisium> stork went 2-0!
00:27:00 <Crisium> woo
00:27:08 <Dot`> \o/
00:27:20 <Crisium> \o/
00:27:26 <motbob> everyone knows that you sing better in the bathroom. And the generally accepted theory as to why is that the walls of a bathroom are tiled (and not porous), which means that the acoustics in the bathroom are different than in most rooms
00:28:12 <motbob> But I think I just stumbled upon another potential reason, which is that pooping forces a person to exercise the muscles that make people sing better
00:28:52 <Bio> According to all known laws
00:28:52 <Bio> of aviation,
00:28:52 <Bio> there is no way a bee
00:28:52 <Bio> should be able to fly.
00:28:52 <Bio> Its wings are too small to get
00:28:54 <Bio> its fat little body off the ground.
00:28:56 <Bio> The bee, of course, flies anyway
00:28:58 <Bio> because bees don't care
00:28:58 <motbob> When you're singing, you need diaphragm support. You need to flex the diaphragm to create a consistent, strong sound. It's hard to explain without you trying it
00:29:00 <Bio> what humans think is impossible.
00:29:27 <motbob> And when you're pooping, the straining you make flexes the diaphragm
00:30:01 <motbob> Thank you for reading The Motbob Journal of Scientific Insight
00:30:27 <Dot`> ive heard of sining while in the shower but never while pooping
00:30:58 <Crisium> i should have had more faith in stork, he always makes ro16, has the longest OSL ro16 streak ever, tied with flash i think
00:31:12 <Crisium> now to hope somehow he gets his rightful place of 2nd
00:34:58 <Crisium> rain still looks like the best player iv seen so far in ASL tho, surprising to me
00:35:09 <Crisium> though i guess bisu had an easy 2-0 too
00:39:48 <Dot`> rain is best

02:24:59 <Bio> lad
02:33:37 <DuB`> 20-page writeup and 30 minute presentation all done in the last two days with my group. x)
02:39:35 <Bio> I'm at 2800 in ow
02:39:37 <Bio> yey
02:40:24 <DuB`> Noice!
03:16:48 <ZK> whats the highest mmr at?
03:18:01 <ZK> damnit bio
03:18:03 <ZK> stop scoring
03:35:02 <motbob> what' the basic overwatch scale
03:35:33 <motbob> what's the average/max MMRs
03:40:50 <Bio> nvr zk
03:40:53 <Bio> gief win pls
03:40:59 <Bio> idk mot
03:41:28 <DuB`> 2500 is supposed to be the median.
03:41:30 <DuB`> I think?
03:41:45 <DuB`> 5k max.
03:41:52 <DuB`> http://masteroverwatch.com/leaderboards/pc/global
03:43:25 <motbob> is this a distribution of players who report their MMR, or does it somehow scrape all players?
03:44:07 <motbob> ahaha, look at these spikes at 3000 and 3500
03:45:13 <ZK> fack
03:46:21 <Camail> those spikes make me distrust that data
03:46:47 <motbob> i mean even in Dota people stop playing after they hit xyyy MMR
03:46:52 <DuB`> Just means people get to their "goal" mmr and stop, cam.
03:46:53 <DuB`> Yeh.
03:50:01 <ZK> whats your goal dub
03:50:15 <ZK> oh wait, i did that in sc2 too, when i reached masters
03:50:18 <Camail> 6969
03:50:19 <ZK> then just played from time to time
03:57:34 <Camail> thats interesting, I've never had a set goal like that
03:58:37 <Camail> didnt they add rank erosion
03:58:44 <Camail> will be interesting to see the data in a month
04:07:15 <Camail> i want juri's v trigger to be 1 bar
04:07:30 <Camail> that would be so cool

18:23:16 <skram> REBEL YELL DUB
18:23:35 <DuB`> .9% of final grade, and I'm already in the 80th percentile of class.
18:23:46 <DuB`> I just need to be above average to be guaranteed for the MAcc program.
18:24:09 <DuB`> Really anywhere NEAR average, actually.
18:24:23 <DuB`> Half a percent is psshhhhh.
18:24:23 <skram> so what you are telling me
18:24:29 <skram> is that you are working harder than you need to
18:24:57 <DuB`> Well of course I'm gonna get all the points I can from easy stuff and try hard for tests!
