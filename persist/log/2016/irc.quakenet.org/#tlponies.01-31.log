00:08:03 <Camail_> also chun is so fun
00:08:09 <Camail_> s.lk is the best move int he world
00:08:34 <Camail_> so much to learn
00:08:42 <Camail_> wish i could fight someone who didnt suck
00:08:54 <ZK> online no work?
00:09:23 <Camail_> it does
00:09:29 <Camail_> its jsut that i ahvent beaten enough people
00:09:33 <Camail_> to play good people
00:09:40 <Camail_> got to 500, but taking a break
00:09:47 <ZK> oh kk
00:09:55 <Camail_> its annoying, would be higher but you cant do training mode without fight request on
00:10:02 <Camail_> so like, its hard to actually learn buttons
00:10:12 <Camail_> especially since I havent actually followed sf5 at all
00:10:17 <Camail_> so i came in completely blind
00:10:25 <Camail_> didnt even know what chun's v skill was
00:10:37 <Camail_> or how awful her nj.hk has become...
00:11:00 <Camail_> or her v trigger
00:11:40 <Camail_> i still ahve 3 beta passes left
00:11:49 <Camail_> for this weekend
00:12:01 <Camail_> it gmiht extend to everything else as well?
00:12:04 <Camail_> might*
00:15:11 <Camail> so? any interest?
00:15:30 <Rawr|Fone> I would play if I was home
00:16:11 <Camail> are you going to be home anytime today or tomorrow?
00:16:27 <Camail> there's 24 hours elft in the beta, i believe
00:17:08 <Camail> Dot_  you can play a game i play but face people equally as awful as you
00:17:59 <Camail> no one is playing birdie that i saw
00:20:30 <Dot_> i dont know if i will play cam, i know nothing of street fighter
00:20:44 <Camail> thats fine
00:20:51 <Camail> just offering to see any interest

00:48:10 <DuB`> ... Is it not possible to be in training for more than 15 seconds before it pulls you into a fight?
00:48:53 <Camail> no
00:48:56 <Camail> its the struggle
00:49:03 <Camail> gotta learn on the run
00:49:07 <DuB`> Oookay.

00:49:11 <Camail> but after a little bit you get comfortable
00:49:14 <Camail> and everyone sucks
00:49:19 <Camail> so calm down
00:49:23 <Camail> use basic footsies
00:49:29 <Camail> ases the type of player you are playing
00:49:33 <Camail> and you can start learning
00:49:38 <Camail> assess*
00:50:17 <Camail> first thing is see try and figure out wtf your normals are

04:48:06 <Cane> If someone else wants it you can give it to them, since I will be getting SF5 later.
04:48:36 <Cane> I don't have the time or desire to play it just yet is the point.

20:12:35 <DoT`> <3
20:13:10 <DoT`> apparently some ppl i have never heard of became very hated on the internet today
20:13:26 <DoT`> for trying to trademark the word "react" in youtube videos
20:13:48 <Phearlock> Oh that wasn't today
20:13:50 <CockRoach|42> you've never seen "kids/whatever reacts to ...."?
20:13:52 <Phearlock> That was like yesterday
20:14:01 <Phearlock> today people just got more mad
20:14:01 <CockRoach|42> two days ago, give or take
20:14:06 <DoT`> im so behind phear D:
20:14:16 <CockRoach|42> two days ago, people of the youtubes got mad
20:14:17 <Phearlock> it's ok slowbro
20:14:21 <CockRoach|42> today the plebs got mad
20:14:41 <Phearlock> Reddit got mad yesterday
20:14:42 <DoT`> i never heard of these ppl and have never watched a ____ reacts to____
20:14:44 <Phearlock> is when I heard abou tit
20:14:50 <DoT`> but i do know of such vidoes
20:14:52 <Phearlock> I've heard of reacts to vids
20:15:01 <Phearlock> And seen one or two pony ones
20:15:06 <CockRoach|42> i've seen a few.. but meh
20:15:07 <Phearlock> But never the other stuff
20:15:12 <DoT`> ty for stream yolt <3
20:15:38 <Phearlock> Yeah I think the age demographic that react videoes are aimed as is somewhere below the age group My little pony is aimed at.
20:15:50 <DoT`> must be
20:17:16 <CockRoach|42> no younger than 5?

21:36:35 <Phearlock> biopon!
21:36:37 <Phearlock> Hello
21:37:11 <BioSC> there was a shitposting theory on r/xcom
21:37:15 <BioSC> I'm buying into it
21:37:45 <BioSC> https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/43htem/meta_on_the_source_of_the_shitposts_in_this_sub/
21:37:57 <Phearlock> https://derpiboo.ru/1077529 have some cute shipping guys.
21:38:48 <BioSC> Twilight ships with everypon
21:39:01 <BioSC> but Twidash is the biggest, fastest ship
21:39:22 <carcinisation> lol bio
21:43:16 <DoT|Phone> Haha bio. it would also explain the overwatch
21:43:28 <DoT|Phone> reddit
21:44:24 <BioSC> its a pretty sound theory
21:44:26 <BioSC> also
21:44:35 <BioSC> overwatch hype should start building again
21:44:47 <BioSC> new opprotunities to NOT be invited to beta
21:45:02 <BioSC> I do forsee scumbag blizrad
21:45:13 <BioSC> ohai Bio, I see you have a nice, shiny new XCOM to play
21:45:22 <BioSC> how about trying out this overwatch over here
21:49:23 <DoT|Phone> while I get emails from blizzard telling me useless things instead of an invite
21:50:16 <Phearlock> =)

21:53:25 <DoT|Phone> fixing all friendship problems
21:53:39 <Phearlock> What's wrong skram? =D
21:54:05 <skram> the shitpost theory on the xcom subreddit
21:54:23 <Phearlock> =)
21:54:25 <skram> is a shitpost in itself
21:54:34 <Phearlock> Ayy
21:54:45 <BioSC> lmao
21:55:20 <skram> i feel so betrayed
21:55:36 <carcinisation> betrayyyed
21:56:57 <BioSC> To understand the shitpost, you must become it.
21:57:23 <DoT|Phone> is that not wrist reddit is Skram
21:57:24 <Phearlock> Kill aliens, hug ponies, post shit
21:57:29 <Phearlock> The life
21:57:50 <skram> are you gonna stream all of xcome ferlok
21:57:57 <skram> because im not going to buy it but i wanna see what happens
21:57:58 <BioSC> Imma try to
21:58:01 <Phearlock> My stream has been being very weird
21:58:09 <skram> excellent
21:58:18 <Phearlock> But steam broadcast has worked ok so far so might just use that.
21:58:50 <Phearlock> I'm not decided on whether to go straight to Ironman Legendary at the start and see how long it takes me to complete the game like that xD
21:58:56 <BioSC> lol
21:58:57 <DoT|Phone> bio I wish to be an xcom person and die horribly to snek ppl
21:58:58 <Phearlock> Or to just play classic or something
21:59:06 <BioSC> of course dotties
21:59:36 <BioSC> I'm probably gonna do 1 difficulty up from easiest
21:59:40 <BioSC> then do replays
21:59:43 <BioSC> on harder
22:00:04 <BioSC> The devs has said the story is much more important than in EW/EU
22:01:08 <Phearlock> Yeah might do legendary + savescum
22:01:15 <Phearlock> Will see
22:01:25 <DoT|Phone> I normally like one you from normal difficulty in games
22:01:40 <DoT|Phone> up*
22:01:41 <Phearlock> Yeah I also usually play that
22:01:52 <Phearlock> But is like... 500 hours of long war

23:45:45 <Crisium> i guess everthing Bison does is + on block
23:46:05 <Crisium> hard to know what to do without frame data or experience :O
23:47:54 <Crisium> oh my first dhalsim fight now
23:47:56 <Crisium> glgl
23:49:42 <Crisium> and i lost
23:49:43 <Crisium> lol
23:49:46 <Crisium> no experience hurts
23:49:53 <Crisium> all these guys on tonight ranked waaay high
23:50:07 <Crisium> everyone knows frame traps already
23:50:51 <DoT`> :/
23:52:37 <Runbunny> Crisium how is the lag for you?
23:52:51 <Runbunny> I keep getting people form the US that teleport all over the place.
23:53:12 <Crisium> set your limit to 5 only
23:53:22 <Crisium> also this fucking sucks now
23:53:31 <Crisium> all the bad ppl that i played yesterday are gone
23:53:37 <Crisium> 0-4
23:53:40 <Runbunny> The US needs to step up it's internet game.

23:54:12 <Crisium> lag free outside your continent is not possible
23:54:36 <Crisium> even if you can ping accross the atlantic at less than 200ms thats still 10+ frames
23:54:55 <Camail> time to make wormholes
23:54:55 <Runbunny> no no but compared to playing vs camail and stuff this is completely broken.
23:55:16 <Camail> well sf4 has a different netcode
23:55:19 <Runbunny> since it doesn't slow down just teleporting all over the screen.
23:55:19 <Camail> fundamentally
23:55:49 <Camail> can you get any EU matches?
23:55:53 <Runbunny> I got 1.
23:56:05 <Runbunny> some bloke from germany.
23:56:19 <Camail> guess eu just ass at fgc
23:56:59 <Crisium> finally won
23:57:06 <Crisium> all the bad players have rage quit i guess lol
23:57:25 <Crisium> 80% winrate is now 20%
23:58:32 <Crisium> sfv lag when you have a good connection is better than 4 but worse when you have a bad con
