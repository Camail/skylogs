00:14:09 <DuB`> Or he should be.
00:14:18 <Dot`> no
00:14:28 <Dot`> Nei
00:15:15 <Dot`> tomrow i should try get through the foods section of norwegion
00:15:59 <Camail> are you learning it so that when you try and conquer norway they wont suspect it?
00:16:38 <Dot`> that, and so I can understand when skram talks bad about me in norsk
00:16:55 <DuB`> Smørbrød
00:17:55 <Cane> Dot` vennligst
00:18:18 <Camail> google translate is good enough
00:18:40 <Dot`> vaar sa snill cane
00:18:40 <Cane> Kjeften på deg Camail
00:18:53 <Dot`> i dont undersntad why its 3 words
00:19:32 <Camail> hexchat doesn't agree that you typed a valid character there, cane
00:19:41 <Camail> so I assume its all useless gibbering
00:19:46 <Golly> æøå
00:19:50 <Camail> those are fine
00:19:55 <Cane> æøåÆØÅ
00:19:58 <Camail> that one
00:20:01 <Camail> is the devils character
00:20:03 <Camail> apaprently
00:20:07 <DuB`> It's the same one! :o
00:20:14 <Cane> It is the same one, wtf
00:20:19 <DuB`> mIRC shows 'em all.
00:20:21 <Cane> ^
00:20:32 <Cane> Camail's IRC client is racist.
00:21:06 <Camail> i dunno if thats how it works
00:21:12 <Dot`> Cane, du er en hest
00:21:19 <Cane> Dot`, du er et esel
00:21:38 <Dot`> ruude
00:21:52 <Camail> but true
00:22:05 <Dot`> maybe
00:22:24 <Dot`> you missed my worst roadhog game ever cam
00:22:33 <Camail> i trust you will have more to come
00:22:44 <Dot`> there was no dissapointment except my own
00:23:19 <Camail> that's never true
00:23:34 <Camail> other people just bottle their disappointment inside and let it fester
00:24:10 <DuB`> We'll just call it a "learning experience".
00:24:18 <Camail> did he ever hook anyone
00:24:25 <DuB`> I dunno!
00:25:27 <Dot`> when i wasnt dying immediatly!
00:25:54 <Dot`> and in the Potg  i made an appeareance and everyone got to see me miss one
00:26:23 <Camail> fucking hell, spent 10 minutes triny gto fix bf1
00:26:26 <Camail> apprently they broke it
00:26:32 <Camail> cant alt tab from borderless winowed
00:26:41 <Camail> which is a bitch considering how awfult he loading times are
00:27:08 <Dot`> :/
00:27:29 <Camail> my typos have increased immensely on this keyboard
00:27:36 <Camail> it is a learning process
00:44:06 <Dot`> dub dub
00:44:15 <DuB`> doot
00:44:21 <Dot`> what now
00:46:10 <DuB`> Witcher? Food?
00:52:58 <skram> DuB`: this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAoADCSpD-8
00:53:22 <Dot`> skram, i was told you had gone to sleep
00:53:32 <Dot`> then cane insulted me in norsk
00:54:12 <skram> No?
00:54:39 <skram> I took of my clothes and then put myself in bed and got bored
00:55:17 <DuB`> ...
00:57:11 <skram> Also Dot`, I only told you nice things!
00:57:14 <skram> Runbunny will testify.
00:59:51 <Runbunny> when?
01:00:05 <skram> Like all the time always
01:07:08 <Camail> i dont believe you
01:07:30 <Dot`> runbuns failure to reply speaks volumes skrammen
01:09:03 <skram> would i lie to you
01:09:21 <Dot`> thats why i need to learn norsk
01:09:45 <Camail> you have lied in english
01:09:57 <Camail> we can only guess how much of a non-english liar you are
01:10:28 <skram> i want you to tell me when i have lied to you camail
01:10:42 <Camail> you said you didn't like me once
01:10:48 <Camail> which is blatantly not true
01:10:50 <Camail> you love me
01:10:53 <skram> entirely truthful
01:18:35 <Runbunny> Sleep.
01:18:42 <Camail> dont do it
01:18:43 <Camail> its deadly
01:18:49 <Camail> everyone who has ever slept
01:18:49 <Camail> died

04:44:48 <Bio> hi
04:54:07 <Bio> oh boy
04:54:29 <Bio> reports coming out about Obama's Birth Certificate being a forgery w/evidence
04:58:13 <Emi> LOL
04:59:09 <Bio> this is pretty big
05:02:09 <DuB`> !?
05:02:59 <Bio> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk3KRxTfkLM&feature=youtu.be
05:03:14 <Bio> its a live stream
05:12:50 <DuB`> O_o
05:13:40 <Bio> this shit is actually blowing my damn mind
05:24:54 <DuB`> THEY HAD EQUATIONS, BIO.
05:24:58 <DuB`> CRAAAZY ONES.
05:26:15 <Bio> MUTHAFUCKIN MATH
05:26:27 <Bio> JESUS FUCK
05:26:31 <Bio> WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON DUB
05:26:55 <Camail> A = B
05:27:01 <Bio> Presenting illegal official documents is a felony i'm pretty sure
05:27:04 <Camail> 8 = D
05:27:10 <Bio> =O
05:27:18 <Camail> until its on not-fox-news I'll care
05:28:01 <Bio> http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/12/15/sheriff-joe-arpaio-probe-proves-obama-birth-certificate-fake/95500958/
05:33:37 <DuB`> The End
05:34:35 <Camail> that article just said that the press conference happened
05:34:46 <Bio> well, it did!
05:34:50 <Bio> =O
05:34:51 <Camail> I mean another news organization covering the content itself
05:35:06 <Bio> tru
05:35:22 <Camail> that article points out that everyone involved, even the audience, was a birther
05:35:23 <Bio> its strange that fox is the only one live covering it atm
05:35:32 <Camail> making the legitimacy even more suspicious
05:35:43 <Camail> (maybe because its probably not true)
05:36:50 <Camail> Right now i have no reason to believe these experts beyond their titles, and i have no personal personal knowledge of forgery to tip the scale one way or the other
05:37:16 <Camail> so I'll wait until more groups of people weigh in
05:37:48 <Bio> I guess. these guys have been pretty involved in it for like 5 years.
05:38:08 <Camail> yet the circumstances of the conference are very biased
05:38:40 <Bio> biased? it sounds like they just finished collecting evidence and are presenting it
05:38:46 <Bio> to me anyways
05:38:58 <Camail> I said the circumstances, not the conference itself
05:39:07 <Camail> namely, being surrounded by supporters and not peers
05:39:10 <Camail> and being only on fox
05:39:30 <Bio> I'm not sure why its only on fox
05:39:39 <Camail> gee i wonder why
05:39:50 <Camail> maybe because thats the only new source that takes is seriously
05:39:53 <Bio> and the guy presenting addressed "other media" at the start that didn't believe him
05:40:01 <Bio> that were there
05:40:35 <Bio> what other sources would make it better
05:40:58 <Camail> literally anyone else than fox? that's all  I'm asking for
05:41:16 <Bio> ah
05:41:24 <Camail> like, a 2nd opinion
05:41:59 <Camail> it doesnt have to be msn or w/e liberal media there is, i don't care
05:42:13 <Camail> legitimate news tends to spread way faster than this
05:42:28 <Bio> ABC is there I guess
05:42:32 <Camail> so until it happens, i really dont care

06:28:30 <Emi> im already super overdue on this task
06:28:59 <Emi> super fucking overdue. and it will literally affect my grade so i figured ill still fucking submit it and he will probably accept it since i spent a lot of effort on it and its kinda ok
06:29:37 <Emi> but now i literally lose like 3 hrs of work (luckily not 100% everything) since the school remote desktop that i work on just rebooted or something without any warning or anything

17:31:34 <DuB`> Dot I was playing all random mode last night with brother to get free arcade mode lootboxes.
17:31:43 <DuB`> Had some really incredible widow games.
17:31:51 <DuB`> I think I might be widow main, now.
17:32:53 <Dot`> >.>
17:34:47 <DuB`> Also random mode is kind of just first-team-to-get-ana-and-2+-tanks-wins-mode.
17:36:15 <DoT|Phone> lol
17:38:16 <Zounds> I'd like to try widow more often
17:38:29 <Zounds> but i'd also rather not throw games
17:38:47 <DoT|Phone> we play with Skram
17:38:50 <DuB`> Meh, I think there's a bit too much badwidow stigma.
17:38:53 <DuB`> Overdone.
17:39:02 <DuB`> She's no bastion. :P
17:39:37 <DuB`> We'd be fine to pick her sometimes.
17:39:45 <Zounds> Well I think she's a fine hero
17:39:51 <Zounds> but me being fine with her is different
17:40:43 <DuB`> For some reason the ONLY time she ever gets played in our stack is by reef SPECIFICALLY on ilios well.
17:40:44 <DuB`> ???
17:40:47 <DuB`> xD
17:40:57 <DuB`> Silliness!
17:41:19 <DoT|Phone> well dub. it's like hanzo. not a bad hero but the type of player is normally the issue
17:42:14 <DuB`> Heheh
17:43:40 <DuB`> SololQ widows and hanzos do tend to be the "I haven't hit a shot YET this game, but I'm gonna stick to it anyway on Anubis B attack".

22:45:18 <skram> ...Didnt you buy textbooks this summer?
22:47:18 <DuB`> Yes, and I just finished this semester!
22:47:44 <skram> so you need like 500 dollarinos of textbooks per semester?
22:47:55 <DuB`> T _ T
22:48:13 <skram> that sounds more like extortion
22:48:19 <skram> drop out DuB`

23:16:38 <DuB`> skram, tank meta is realer than real.
23:16:39 <DuB`> RIP
23:17:10 <skram> tank meta is almost more boring than stacking mccree meta
23:17:13 <DuB`> 4-2 both teams.
23:17:25 <DuB`> 2monkey 2lucio 2reaper might have this beat, though.
23:17:48 <skram> I like watching mistfits
23:18:08 <skram> They dont really play the meta but still do well
23:19:19 <skram> hafficool is an excellent dva though
23:19:45 <skram> did you ever watch the DH finals?
23:19:57 <DuB`> Oh, no.
23:20:43 <Zounds> stacking mccree meta sounds like a fun one skram
23:20:49 <Zounds> since mccree is handsome and cool everyone should play him
23:21:09 <skram> >_<
23:21:52 <skram> People ran double and sometimes tripple mccree and still won
23:22:02 <skram> pre-s1 I think
23:22:08 <DuB`> This caster is talking like zarya is new to the meta. >_>
23:22:16 <DuB`> Literally there since day 1.
23:22:18 <Zounds> Oh yeah that was the fan the hammer time then
23:22:26 <Zounds> McCree was ugly and uncool back then
23:22:28 <DuB`> Oh gosh.
23:22:33 <DuB`> Fan the hammer. T_T
23:22:44 <skram> I think rein/zarya/lucio have never been out of meta
23:23:05 <skram> i cant remember seeing someone not having lucio and rein and still winning
23:26:32 <skram> cheeky
23:27:13 <Camail> yea but sym is gonna change everything!
23:27:17 <Camail> revolutionary!
23:27:44 <skram> its basically the 2nd comming of christ
23:28:08 <DuB`> (But only on 2cp defense)
23:28:20 <skram> conditional jesus
23:28:48 <ZK> .roll d20 to boop DuB`
23:29:01 <ZK> u done with studs du?
23:29:36 <DuB`> Yah!
23:39:57 <DuB`> Ana makes tanks so strong that teams can't even just zen+reaper or something to beat it. D:
