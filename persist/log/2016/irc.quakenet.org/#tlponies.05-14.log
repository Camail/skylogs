18:41:54 <skram> oh boy, eurovision song contest
18:42:06 <DuB`> Quakenet pls.

18:43:59 <Yolteotl> russian cheating every years
18:47:15 <skram> http://i.imgur.com/oQ72wX9.jpg
18:50:02 <Rawr|Fone> They must be quite bad at cheating yolt
19:00:07 <Bio> man
19:00:11 <Bio> pony was nice
19:00:24 <Bio> super sing-songy-sugary-sweet
19:03:24 <Cane> Yeah, Eurovision time again.
19:03:26 <Cane> Norway is out this year.
19:03:35 <Cane> Which I consider appropriate penance for all of our boring ballads in recent years.
19:04:48 <Cane> Having the world not fully appreciate our soulful and meaningful life-lesson ballads sung by a bunch of barely-20-year-olds with the weight of knowledge and wisdom on their shoulders must have come as a big surprise to the voters.
19:05:55 <Cane> Don't be boring, Norway, be Finland. They fucking kicked ass with the heavy metal growlers in makeup.
19:06:06 <CockRoach|42> :)
19:06:09 <Cane> Suddenly Eurovision was WORTH WATCHING again for that, for one glorious moment!
19:06:47 <skram> Thats like 10 years ago by now!
19:08:38 <skram> Maybe if we had a sax player doing pelvic thrusts we would get somewhere.
19:08:50 <Phearlock> That guy
19:12:45 <Bio> that ponki song was rly gud
19:32:01 <DoT`> we are bad at rolls
19:33:31 <Runbunny> You just need to have the statistical outcome favor you Dot.
19:34:07 <DoT`> i should roll 20's for the rest of the day
19:34:35 <Runbunny> .roll d20
19:34:38 <Runbunny> easy.

21:24:25 <DuB`> Opinions on the verbal component of Suggestion being the suggestion itself seem split.
