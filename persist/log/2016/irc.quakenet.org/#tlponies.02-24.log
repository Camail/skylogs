01:50:34 <DoT`> gnight all <3
01:52:45 <Camail> oh cris i dunno if you did this, but putting -fullscreen -borderless in sf5 launch options is the only way to make borderless windowed
01:52:48 <Camail> its super dumb
01:53:05 <Camail> it makes alt tabbing a million times easier
01:53:21 <Camail> for some reason sf5 takes a lot of time to alt tab in fullscreen for me

02:59:34 <Cane> Camail, does -fullscreen -borderless add frame lag at all?
03:00:10 <Camail> i dont know? I'm running just fine
03:00:22 <Cane> Well, I know for USF4, vsync on adds like 3 frames to input lag.
03:00:40 <Camail> you can force v sync off
03:00:54 <Camail> the engine.ini in the appdata folder for sf5 is where you put it
03:01:09 <motbob> why would vsync add 3 frames...
03:01:10 <Camail> tbf i dont KNOW if that works but i saw it online
03:01:39 <Camail> 3 frames is an arbitrary number for 'some lag'
03:02:16 <Camail> v sync fucks with framerate and streetfighters have their engine tied to framerate
03:02:22 <Camail> so its generally not a good idea to use
03:02:36 <Camail> and my generally i mean never
03:02:54 <motbob> how do you link framerate to the engine in an online game
03:03:04 <Camail> ggpo
03:03:08 <Camail> rollback netcode
03:03:21 <Camail> also offline is more important than online from a pure gameplay perspective
03:03:58 <Camail> street fighters must run at 60 fps
03:04:07 <Camail> anything more, or less, actually ruins it
03:05:03 <Camail> so people with bad computers cant play and will have terrible rollbacks online
03:07:55 <motbob> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhzkwTvglY
03:08:35 <Camail> Crisium_  there's a  1 frame window where you can actually use mk sbk in that crackfiend combo...for like 10 more damage
03:08:47 <motbob> SFV is really beautiful to watch, I think much more so than SF4
03:08:53 <Camail> yea
03:09:01 <Camail> tbf sf4 came out in 2008
03:09:35 <motbob> Some games just sort of grab you. I watched 120 seconds of Dota 2 and was grabbed. This was the early beta in 2011.
03:10:04 <Crisium_> Whats amazing is that they managed to make Banana Hair Ken in SFV look good by comparison to the He-Man Ken of SF4
03:10:22 <Camail> I liked the way it looked
03:10:26 <Camail> sf4, that is
03:10:40 <Camail> when i first saw it i dont really rmemeber what i thought
03:10:52 <Camail> other than 'I want to learn what these people are doing'
03:11:48 <Camail> man pr rog was so sad when he lost the first round
03:12:07 <Crisium_> watching that vid now motbob
03:12:08 <Camail> rashid is marvel
03:12:49 <Crisium_> pr rog could have won round 1 if he did ex FBA instead of ex Roll to end his stun combo
03:12:58 <Crisium_> i think it would have done enough extra damage
03:13:00 <Camail> i dunno why there's that weird slow down at the end
03:13:28 <Crisium_> well, with all the scaling its hard to say
03:13:37 <Crisium_> but he did not do optimal punish
03:13:49 <Camail> god i hate bieng in the lab against birdie, his idle animation has him picking his nose and throwing a booger at you
03:13:54 <Camail> which has a hitbox
03:14:08 <Camail> so when I'm not doing anytihng i just get to hear THAT all the time
03:14:56 <Crisium_> i havcent played sfv since saturday, maybe i should try again tomorrow
03:17:21 <motbob> why does the stun mechanic exist?
03:17:35 <Crisium_> now thats a good question actually
03:17:46 <Crisium_> in SF2 it was actually random
03:17:53 <Crisium_> sometimes a combo would stun sometimes it wouldnt
03:18:15 <Crisium_> i think its too make the player track something else besides health and meter
03:18:26 <Crisium_> other games use guard break if you block too much, but i dont like that
03:18:28 <motbob> it could probably be justified nowadays from a spectator standpoint
03:19:20 <Camail> I mean, initial reasons? i dunno
03:19:31 <Camail> but it adds a variable to the game that's fun
03:19:32 <Crisium_> in SF3 i would use often prioritize high stun moves over damage
03:19:53 <Camail> if someone's close to stun it changes both players options
03:20:00 <Camail> all of a sudden every hit turns into a full combo
03:20:02 <Crisium_> any combo you have to take into account damage, position, and also stun - either one could be more important than the other at that time
03:20:09 <Camail> or maybe your character has a combo that does 100% stun
03:20:18 <Camail> it happened in kof 13
03:20:56 <Camail> or you have moves that do a lot of stun
03:22:00 <Crisium_> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwFIkuxVN1U&feature=youtu.be&t=3s
03:22:28 <Camail> I guess in its most basic form it encourages offense 
03:22:48 <Camail> and encourages smart defense
03:23:02 <Crisium_> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNrsnnQjRcs
03:23:03 <Camail> in a way that isnt just "you fail = you die"
03:23:24 <Crisium_> also that SF4 zangief anti air that does 500 stun or whatever
03:23:28 <Crisium_> lol
03:23:31 <Camail> j.hp
03:23:41 <Camail> on hugo he could do 2 in a combo
03:37:28 <motbob> With characters and outfits being unlocked via fight money, I don't think it'll be long before the lower levels of matchmaking are saturated with bot.
03:37:28 <motbob> s
03:39:24 <Crisium_> god i hope not
