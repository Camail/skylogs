01:47:38 <DuB`work> :P
01:47:59 <DuB`work> I never expected to actually care about a mobile game, so my name is "Oi what a pain" in JP because I hate choosing names.
01:48:36 <Bio> i gave u ten hearts
01:48:40 <Bio> enjoy them
01:48:47 <DuB`work> Heh
01:48:48 <DuB`work> Okay
01:49:02 <Bio> go summon a shitty slime with em
01:49:18 <DuB`work> So you'll want to focus on your magic knight, neo agent, and wind pixie for now.
01:49:19 <Camail> mobile games? we truly are the weeb channel now
01:49:40 <Bio> nice, all the guys that left for tlanimoo can come back now
01:49:42 <Bio> =P
01:50:10 <Camail> not enough creepy loli for that
01:50:34 <Bio> dab u have so many purple stars
01:50:39 <DuB`work> Yah.
01:50:52 <DuB`work> You'll want to awaken the wind pixie shannon as soon as possible, she's incredible.
01:51:23 <Bio> I think I almost can
01:54:00 <DuB`work> Looked at a few, this is probably the best general guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/55e4r6/new_player_guide/
01:55:06 <DuB`work> Pretty cool that you got emma (water neo agent) so early, she'll help out a lot.
02:05:34 <Bio> wind pixie woke af
02:06:23 <DuB`work> Bahah
02:07:39 <DuB`work> Okay, first step is probably just using her, emma, magic knight, and something else to clear all the story scenarios on normal and hard.
02:09:07 <DuB`work> Completing the dark ifrit fusion is the next big thing, he's the single most important monster for progression in the game.
02:09:26 <DuB`work> Bit of a grind to finish him, but he's the only monster that literally everyone "needs".

23:20:47 <Dot> you did at that 
23:21:29 <Runbunny> for me it was that I was taught french in school, when I first starting watching animes and that somehow ended up being connected.
