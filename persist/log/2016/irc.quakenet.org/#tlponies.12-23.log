21:41:08 <ZK> oh yay snute and neeb!
21:42:32 <Yolteotl> After a very successful year on (Wiki)Millenium, (P)ShoWTimE parts ways with the french organisation. As one of the very best foreign players with great BlizzCon chances, it will be interesting to see which team he will join next.  Edit: (T)Dayshi also left and it seems Millenium disbanded their sc2 squad.
21:43:04 <ZK> yea, france doenst like sc2 anymore
21:43:53 <Yolteotl> looks like it's because Millenium is part of Webedia (french evil corporation)
