05:32:34 <Camail> .tell dub` your birthday gift is a list of spell AOEs translated to the grid, where at least half of a square must be covered to be included. The point of origin is not necessarily the character, but for cones it is.
05:49:35 <Camail> .tell dub` actually fuck that noise i made a token that is scalable and shows exactly what you can hit with cones of any range
06:30:14 <Camail> oh i have an interesting idea for DM flavor, if someone thinks they dont hit a creature and says so before i do, it doesnt hit
06:30:19 <Camail> you must believe in your strikes
06:30:28 <Camail> if you assume failure, you get failure

17:02:15 <Yolteotl> 970
17:02:20 <Yolteotl> not enough
17:02:36 <DoT`> how are they not coping? what you doing with them
17:07:03 <Camail> dot is your mic quiet on any other program?
17:07:50 <DoT`> hmmm, its most quite on discord, but in genral my voice just doesnt carry well
17:08:09 <Camail> that matters irl but not with people with headphones
17:08:26 <DoT`> well mics dont like picking up my voice
17:09:04 <DoT`> though to be fair, ive never had an expensive mic , maybe i always have bad mics
17:09:53 <DoT`> why cam?
17:10:05 <Camail> just curious, trying to figure out if there's a way to change it
17:10:30 <Camail> its a weird problem where other people will talk over you because they dont even know you are trying to talk
17:14:39 <DoT`> the only tihng i can do is turn up attenuation, but i worry that will create a huge fuzzing when i talk
17:15:02 <DoT`> its at 10 db atm
17:15:39 <Camail> yea the static has drowned you out the times that you've done that
17:15:43 <Camail> or something similar
17:16:22 <Camail> hmmm
17:17:07 <DoT`> i tihnk my mic jack on motherboard might just be faulty at this point
17:18:07 <DoT`> and the front sockets as expected SUCK
17:18:12 <Camail> boo

22:15:42 <skram> what happened to it
22:17:00 <Camail> have you ever tried an eye patch?
22:17:17 <Camail> 1. look like a pirate 2. pillage in the darkness 3. maybe less eye strain
22:17:22 <Camail> those are 3 solid reasons
22:17:30 <Camail> 1 and 2 are closely related
22:17:55 <DoT`> i use to haev to wear an eye patch

22:24:51 <DuB`> OBERWAJ PLS.
22:25:02 <skram> CLAM DOWN

22:25:52 <Camail> i think we should figure out how to make an overwatch one-shot
22:25:59 <Camail> also dnd tomorrow
22:26:00 <Camail> rememberrrr
22:26:38 <skram> I want to play a muderhobo campaign with characters that have stupid stats
22:26:55 <skram> like 16 str and 3 int or something
22:27:02 <Camail> pm me when you find a dm
22:27:28 <Camail> 3 int = unintelligent beast
22:28:00 <skram> like low enough to not know a language
22:28:43 <skram> is idiot savant a thing in any dnd ruleset
22:29:30 -!- Holmir [~Holmir@h-4-153.a166.priv.bahnhof.se] has joined #tlponies
22:32:47 <Camail> like low enough to not understand anything
22:32:51 <Camail> like, being a turtle
22:32:59 <skram> turtles are nice
22:33:03 <Camail> most min maxxers are idiot savants
22:33:17 <Camail> because they think as a player and let their int be 6
22:33:23 <Camail> but dont rollplay the 6
22:33:32 <Camail> because they think a lifetime as a fighter means you must be a strategist
22:33:48 <Camail> even though there's a reason some people stay grunts or just quit the milatary
22:33:51 <Camail> or are shitty camptains
22:34:03 <Camail> captains/officers/high ranking ppl
22:35:27 <Camail> but the lowest a stat can be is probably 5, like a troll or something
22:35:34 <Camail> 4 and lower are strictly beastial
22:36:02 <Camail> 3 you are just a meat pile moving around
22:36:12 <Runbunny> .roll d20 to poke skram in the eye
22:36:14 <skram> murderpile
22:36:25 <skram> jokes on you
22:36:29 <skram> both my eyes are fake

22:55:30 <DuB`> Dune, Butlerian Jihad
23:03:24 <Camail> oh man air genasi in 5e are cool
23:03:41 <Camail> float 20ft in the air, sling arrows and spells and shit
23:07:10 <Runbunny> ugggggggh
23:07:13 <Runbunny> I need to sleep
23:07:38 <Camail> where is conflict
23:07:42 <Camail> rest on keyboard
23:14:41 <Camail> guys i found the reason why i hate point distribution: 15,15,11,10,10,10
23:15:39 <Camail> possibly the most boring, or maybe 15,15,12,10,10,9
23:19:07 <Camail> or 15,15,11,11,11,8 as a human
23:19:18 <ZK> i like the idea behind this thing for point distro: http://castlesandcooks.com/2013/05/09/dd-home-brew-character-creation-the-random-grid-method/
