01:07:16 <motbob> i love bioshock
01:07:42 <motbob> i think bioshock infinite is a 10/10 game and i think bioshock 1 was more influential than any other game that year

01:37:17 <DoT`> nice games
01:37:42 <motbob> oh gears of war was 2006
01:38:49 <motbob> most of the big shooters we have today are direct descendants of those games though. cover-heavy (GoW), ability-centric (bioshock), straight military shooter (CoD)
01:51:11 <motbob> In 2004, World of Warcraft, Halo 2 (aka the start of online matchmaking on console), GTA: San Andreas, and Half Life 2 all released within a month of each other

02:41:00 <Camail> hey we're gonna start the download in 7 seconds once this window fully loads so make sure your looking at it or you ahve to DL everything over again
02:41:20 <Camail> also its a small window with gray text on white background and 10 point font
02:41:37 <Camail> and no actual button to change directories
02:41:56 <Camail> BUT IT LOOKS SLEEK AND MINIMALIST SO ITS COOL RIGHT

02:42:34 <DoT`> a rather tough nexus
02:43:54 <motbob> did i talk in here about the fact that I changed a system font in Windows broke any windows installer that opened a cmd window
02:44:18 <motbob> more specifically, i changed the font that the cmd windows themselves use
02:44:33 <motbob> suddenly, i couldn't install steam games and it took me a long time to figure out why
02:45:32 <DoT`> well thats impressive mot
02:45:39 <DoT`> good job breaking windows

03:06:53 <DoT|Phone> GG
03:10:11 <motbob> DoT`, i changed it because i wanted to see if another font would be easier to read. i changed teh font and the size
03:11:38 <DoT|Phone> how tricky was it. from my experience Windows doesn't like having base things changed
03:12:17 <DoT|Phone> like the colour of the bar when copying. it's pretty set on staying green
03:13:16 <motbob> how tricky to fix? i just googled things like "[the thing I wanted to install] won't install" and then I found the way to get it to spit out an error log, then i looked through the error log until i saw something that said something about a font, then I put 2 and 2 together
03:14:05 <motbob> so, basic stuff for someone in computer science, and impossible stuff for anyone who isn't
03:14:28 <DoT|Phone> no. how tricky to change it originally?
03:15:27 <DoT|Phone> I to mess around with random Windows things when I worked in IT
03:15:34 <DoT|Phone> but never the font
03:17:49 <motbob> i think you just open a cmd window and right click things
03:18:14 <motbob> looks like you right click the top left
03:18:40 <DoT`> oh
03:18:42 <DoT`> cool
03:26:38 <Camail> was it a problem font, or was changing it to anything gonna raise that error

06:12:18 <Camail> omg the gray life
06:12:31 <Camail> man, people who think sf5 is boring are dumb...
06:12:36 <Camail> i just dont see it
06:13:57 <Crisium> im telling you, chris g specials and sako combos have make ppl think thats the only thing entertaining
06:15:22 <Camail> sako combos have existed for much longer than the relevant time
06:15:43 <Camail> also chris g was hated for being boring
06:16:36 <Crisium> elena is hated for being boring
06:16:38 <Crisium> lol
06:16:41 <Camail> and people hate infinites in mvc3
06:16:52 <Crisium> evil ryu is what they want
06:17:04 <Camail> people aren't execution junkies, thats's not the reason
06:17:11 <Camail> a single reason can't change the landscape
06:17:25 <Camail> nothing is ever that simple, ever
06:17:33 <Crisium> whats your thoughts on why ppl think SF5 is boring
06:18:04 <Camail> partly i don't know, but the rest, i think it being a new game brings out a lot of issues
06:18:24 <Crisium> people lamented over lack of jab combos for months
06:18:30 <Camail> a lot of people cant see the potential because of the foreign mechanics, and they cant process it
06:19:20 <Camail> so all of the things they learned no longer applied, and they aren't easily replaceable concepts, so whats left is nothing; a void of decision making
06:19:40 <Camail> so, less decisions, less mechanics that they've grown to like and have personalized
06:19:48 <Camail> less attachments and more boring
06:20:05 <Camail> ONE of those mechanics is longer combos
06:20:39 <Camail> but crouch teching, jab combos, focus-backdash, fadc, et.c
06:21:03 <Camail> taking those out without a 1 to 1 replacements makes a lot of people unable to understand other complexities
06:21:23 <Camail> hit confirming in this game is entirely different than in 4
06:21:36 <Camail> almost no hard knockdowns
06:21:47 <Camail> no ultras
06:22:25 <Camail> also a serious lack of play time for most people
06:22:38 <Camail> so a lot of the haters haven't really been able to feel the game
06:22:45 <Crisium> V Trigger cancel is the closest to new FADC, but not for the entire cast
06:22:57 <Camail> and also the number of people who dislike it is exaggerated
06:22:59 <Crisium> i think that could open up a lot of complexities
06:23:08 <Camail> v trigger also doesnt work on most specials
06:23:11 <Camail> at least not chuns
06:23:22 <Camail> i dont think v trigger matters that much tbh
06:23:27 <Camail> like,t he cancelling itself
06:23:30 <Crisium> as will crush counter seteups which i think will be veeeery important
06:23:37 <Camail> FADC doesnt even matter that much
06:24:01 <Camail> FADC is a slight damage boost, a set up, or to make something safe
06:24:19 <Camail> the rest is just mind games
06:24:27 <Crisium> V Trigger can be used to make things safe and damage boosts for many characters
06:24:31 <Camail> and you can only do it once per round
06:24:37 <Crisium> the comparison has been discussed quite a bit
06:24:45 <Camail> I am not saying they are different
06:24:46 <Crisium> unfortunately vega cant use his that way
06:24:54 <Camail> I'm saying at best even if they are perfect parallels, it doesnt matter
06:25:26 <Crisium> im not even sure if you are arguing with me, and if you are im less sure why
06:25:40 <Camail> v trigger actually gets you way more damage than focus most of the time
06:25:45 <Camail> I'm jsut disucssing v trigger
06:26:46 <Crisium> for most characters it is more than FADC, true
06:26:52 <Crisium> but its not a universal mechanic
06:26:54 <Crisium> aka Vega lol
06:27:06 <Camail> i think v trigger having a pause is really important for limiting its use
06:27:24 <Crisium> that can help though, you can use it to react to an opponent during startup
06:27:43 <Camail> start up of what/when?
06:27:57 <Camail> you'll never activate it raw
06:28:04 <Camail> seems like a waste unless you ahve like 5% helath
06:28:13 <Camail> because it has post-pause start up
06:28:38 <Camail> but i like v trigger cancels mroe than fadc, thats for sure
06:29:00 <Camail> i like separating resources int his way, its more interesting
06:29:35 <Crisium> this video does a good job of comparing crush counter and "most" characters v skill directly to focus attacks
06:29:37 <Crisium> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFICK1CMcvA
06:29:50 <Crisium> the  beginning is fundamentals but he gets into it eventually
06:30:12 <Crisium> v trigger* i mean

06:33:54 <Crisium> i hope to see crush counters, v skills, and v triggers give as many or more options to the game as FA, FADC, and Red Focus - and it is very interesting that they vary per character far more than FA does
06:34:14 <Crisium> characters are far more unique in SFV than 4
06:35:38 <Camail> i dont agree with him at all when he says crush counter serves essentially the same purpose
06:35:49 <Camail> crush counters are going to happen far more frequently in neutral game
06:35:57 <Camail> and focus was very very rarely used in neutral game
06:36:11 <Crisium> for sure
06:36:22 <Camail> He bases ths purelu on the fact that they both stagger
06:36:26 <Camail> thats his only point he gives
06:36:30 <Camail> purely*
06:36:44 -!- DoT|Phone [~Dot@0546eeee.skybroadband.com] has joined #tlponies
06:37:20 <Camail> focus moves themselves were extremely character dependent (dudley and fei long) at best, and just not used at worst
06:38:07 <Crisium> i never said they didnt vary per character, but cc vskill and v trigger vary far more than anything FA related character per character
06:39:12 <Camail> that's fine, i just dont think there are any parallels between the strategic use of focus attacks and crush counters, pertianing to the video
06:39:17 <Crisium> thats why i think SFV will be as deep as 4, mostly, since some v moves arent that flexible
06:39:29 <Crisium> its not cc alone, its everything
06:39:36 <Crisium> cc has one parallel, v trigger has another
06:39:44 <Camail> I'm splitting focus attacks from fadc
06:39:50 <Camail> conceptually
06:40:16 <Crisium> then even the v skill for most characters covers another parallel
06:40:33 <Crisium> they often have invincibility and will just eat other moves
06:40:39 <Camail> v skills?
06:40:49 <Crisium> parry
06:40:58 <Crisium> absorb fireball with charlie and bison
06:40:59 <Crisium> those
06:41:18 <Camail> what is the parallel
06:41:36 <Camail> only parry and gief armor are parallels to focus
06:41:39 <Crisium> they have invincibility and you beat out attacks you baited with them
06:41:46 <Crisium> vegas is too
06:41:55 <Crisium> it has full hit invincibilty for some of it
06:42:03 <Crisium> beats others pokes if you can read them
06:42:10 <Camail> thats a bit to abstract to be a parallel to focus
06:42:36 <Crisium> completely disagree, and am disappoint in you for not seeing it :P
06:42:54 <Camail> focus doesnt have any i frames
06:42:59 <Crisium> it doesnt have to be 100% the same
06:43:11 <Crisium> please lol
06:43:35 <Crisium> obviously kens is nothing like it, but some characters it is
06:43:41 <Camail> 3 out of 16?
06:43:55 <Crisium> mikas has armor too
06:44:00 <Camail> and focus was never incorporated into a character's play style like v skills are
06:44:06 <Crisium> yes
06:44:07 <Camail> so they'll undoubtedly fill different roles
06:44:08 <Crisium> they are different
06:44:09 <Crisium> you are right
06:44:13 <Camail> lmao mika v skill
06:44:20 <Camail> that is not relevant to focus attacks
06:45:30 <Camail> I would like to see someone use it ever
06:45:36 <Crisium> you can use it on fireballs to build your own meter (and also buff your own damage), iv even seen it used to absorb a hit and counter hit with the mic
06:45:48 <Crisium> i dont remember which stream ofc so i cant find it
06:46:02 <Crisium> just remember cam, i know they are different
06:46:07 <Camail> using it in mid range is such a risk
06:46:29 <Camail> nothing I've said means they are identical
06:46:38 <Camail> I'm jsut making you actually explain what your points
06:48:35 <motbob> "quick rises"
06:48:53 <Camail> yes?
06:48:54 <motbob> sf5 added teching? we melee?
06:49:00 <Camail> no LOL
06:49:11 <Camail> teching has existed before melee was even on the desk int he office
06:49:16 <motbob> ok
06:49:58 <Camail> i cant remember what game it was added in, but its entirely possible that the concept is older than me
06:49:59 <Crisium> capcom really trying to avoid vortex fighter 4 again
06:50:27 <Camail> delayed wake up in sf4 killed vortex pretty silently,
06:50:44 <Camail> it was weird
06:50:45 <motbob> what a cool mechanic teching is

06:51:40 <Camail> its almost like a dynamic form of killer instincts combo breakers
06:51:56 <motbob> what's the earliest game that you can think of that it was definitely in? and what was it called then?
06:52:22 <Camail> well the word tech stands for technical, which is what showed up ont he screen in capcom games when you quick rise
06:52:39 <Camail> so the term was coined by an arcade game some time ago
06:53:13 <Camail> king of fighters is super old
06:53:18 <Camail> pretty sure they've always ahd techs
06:56:23 <Camail> ko so at LEAST as far back as kof 98, with is 18 years ago
06:56:25 <Camail> ok*
06:56:41 <Camail> trying to figure out if early versions had it
06:58:08 <Crisium> talking about waking up differently?
06:58:33 <Camail> did sf2 have teching
06:58:41 <Camail> I knew it had reversals, albeit shit ones
06:58:49 <motbob> generally, the concept of doing an input before you hit the ground to do something beneficial
06:59:08 <Crisium> hmm
06:59:30 <Crisium> pretty sure all versions of SF3 have it, first one was 97
07:00:27 <Crisium> i actually dont know about alpha serious cause i hated it lol
07:00:43 <Camail> I'm jsut searching for 'soft knockdown'
07:00:51 <Camail> seems to be a term used even back then
07:00:56 <Crisium> ya SF3 97 definitely had it
07:01:38 <Crisium> alpha 2 has it according to srk wiki
07:02:13 <Camail> also its possible some shit indie game had teching
07:02:14 <Crisium> alpha 1 had it
07:02:26 <Crisium> ya there were so many crappy fighting games circa 1993
07:02:46 <Camail> sf2 definitely did not have it tho
07:03:01 <Crisium> yeah, Alpha 1 in 95 was the first sf to get it
07:03:06 <Camail> so somewhere between 1990 and 1995
07:04:15 <Camail> hard to find anytihng about KI1
07:04:19 <Camail> fucking reboots...
07:05:50 <Crisium> rebooting with the same name should be a crime
07:05:59 <Crisium> it why everyone call Mortal Kombat MK9
07:07:24 <motbob> let's all look forward to playing DOOM this spring
07:08:06 <Camail> death eternal
07:08:20 <Camail> it doesnt look like ki1 had it, but I'm not 100%
07:08:30 <Camail> if ti does, we can get back to 1993
07:08:34 <Camail> almost older than me

07:12:26 <Camail> http://www.twitch.tv/eg_jwong
07:12:34 <Camail> ok she's not as slow as she was
07:12:40 <Camail> she got fat for some reason
07:14:26 <Camail> the best part of sf5 was taking out chip kills from special moves
07:14:42 <Camail> it affects me greatly as a player and a spectator
07:15:19 <motbob> oh that is a good cahnge
07:15:55 <motbob> http://i.imgur.com/otvAqqB.gifv
07:18:36 <Camail> also  mika's alt costume is gonna make her playable for me
07:19:38 <Crisium> her fault is too impossible
07:19:43 <Camail> i think it covers about as little skin but there are no cheesecake windows
07:20:43 <Camail> on of her legs is completely unclothed int he alt but because it follows a line and isnt just a windows to bare inner thigh meat it so much more tasteful
07:21:02 <motbob> lawl
07:21:45 <Crisium> default mika, and laura for that matter, would be ward drobe malfunctioning every other hit
07:22:16 <Camail> oh god laura pls
07:22:22 <Crisium> at least zangief has nips now
07:22:26 <Crisium> and shirtless ryu
07:22:28 <Crisium> Kappa
07:22:30 <Camail> at least you could put double sided tape on mika's costume
07:22:45 <Camail> laura's is just...damn i dunno
07:22:57 <Crisium> and then that laura alt
07:22:59 <Crisium> lol
07:23:07 <Camail> karin's is probably my favorite
07:23:38 <Camail> laura is cosplay bait, 100%
07:23:52 <Camail> oh shit luffy is sponsored by redbull
07:23:54 <Camail> thats cool
07:23:55 <Camail> makes sense
07:24:50 <Crisium> http://www.eventhubs.com/imagegallery/2016/jan/20/more-street-fighter-5-alternate-costumes-images/6/
07:24:53 <Crisium> i just dont even
07:24:55 <Crisium> lol
07:25:52 <Camail> just add the camel toe
07:25:57 <Camail> do it, pull the trigger
07:26:25 <Camail> or yoga pants with a crotch window and an arrow pointing down from her navel
07:26:28 <Crisium> no zombie nash thank the gods http://www.eventhubs.com/imagegallery/2016/jan/20/more-street-fighter-5-alternate-costumes-images/53/
07:26:40 <Camail> http://www.eventhubs.com/imagegallery/2016/feb/12/street-fighter-5-story-mode-costume-concept-art/3/
07:26:51 <Camail> this tho, thats some classy shit
07:26:58 <Crisium> http://www.eventhubs.com/imagegallery/2016/jan/20/more-street-fighter-5-alternate-costumes-images/43/
07:27:01 <Crisium> yeah hers is good
07:27:14 <motbob> it kinda looks bad in practice
07:27:52 <Crisium> its all relative motbob
07:27:55 <motbob> the concept art's great but it can't look like that in-game
07:28:01 <Crisium> since laura is in this game thats the best we have
07:29:01 <Camail> the picture itself is bad
07:29:15 <motbob> any video?
07:29:20 <Camail> none, its data mined
07:29:40 <Camail> and i dont even know how they got it in game
07:29:52 <Camail> might not even be finsihed
07:30:19 <Camail> this is the model http://www.eventhubs.com/imagegallery/2016/jan/19/new-street-fighter-5-costumes-found-latest-beta/15/
07:31:29 <Crisium> https://youtu.be/atAidAIYEBk?t=1m47s
07:31:39 <Camail> necalli truly is the blanka of sf5 tho
07:31:44 <Camail> fucking alt costume is nuts
07:32:13 <Camail> i like it in that video
07:32:42 <Camail> especially the v trigger
07:33:37 <Camail> cammy's looks dumb without pants
07:34:39 <Camail> karin has pants on underneath but cammy has a thong
07:34:41 <Camail> sigh
07:34:53 <Camail> i hope streetifghter eventually outgrows this kind of shit
07:35:48 <motbob> HA
07:36:04 <motbob> do you watch anime? what is most animes' target audience?
07:36:48 <motbob> if you mean outgrow as in age, that's not going to happen
07:36:52 <Camail> i didnt say 'fighting games'
07:36:59 <Camail> so there's hope a franchise can be less cheescake
07:37:18 <motbob> how's mortal kombat?
07:37:35 <Camail> mkx isnt as bad as mk9
07:37:39 <Camail> in terms of sexual stuff
07:37:51 <Camail> gore? it goes farther
07:38:33 <Camail> trust me, as a genre it gets a lot worse than sf5
07:38:47 <Crisium> DoA
07:38:48 <Crisium> lol
07:38:50 <Camail> loli fighitng games are a real thing
07:38:56 <Camail> man not even doa at this point
07:39:01 <Camail> anime fighters got perversity on lock
07:39:09 <Camail> arcana heart 3 is a thing
07:39:14 <Camail> skullgirls
07:39:27 <Camail> as much as i respect that game the art style is fucked
07:39:52 <Camail> KoF
07:40:01 <Camail> king's shirt literally evaporates on KO
07:40:16 <Camail> just disappears
07:40:31 <Camail> that game is actually really good about it for the most part
07:40:40 <Camail> i think, its ahrd to tell
07:40:43 <Camail> too many characters
07:40:51 <Camail> oh wait
07:40:59 <Camail> Mai
07:41:00 <Camail> nvm
07:41:27 <Crisium> how many man hours on that jiggle in kof 12/13
07:41:37 <Camail> too many, to be thrown out in 14
07:41:45 <Camail> RIP pixel fighters
07:42:14 <Camail> i suppose the ninja girls in  mk9/10 are still pretty bad
07:42:26 <Camail> but like...
07:42:29 <Camail> it started as that
07:42:30 <motbob> pixels dying just like 2d anime is dying
07:42:47 <Camail> streetfighter was really tame
07:43:03 <Camail> so it at least COULD go back to sanity
07:43:47 <motbob> jk 2d animation is alive https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy_JlG7C-T8&t=2m48s
07:44:08 <Camail> youtube animation is 99% dead
07:44:10 <Camail> that's for sure
07:44:21 <motbob> wait. was it ever alive?
07:44:22 <Camail> never has math affected the art world so much
07:44:25 <Camail> oh yea
07:44:48 <Camail> rubberninja made a living off ad revenue 
07:44:54 <Camail> a few others did as well
07:44:56 <Camail> and it was growing
07:45:07 <Camail> then they changed the algorithm so ggggggg
07:46:28 <Camail> basically all the big newgrounds animators that migrated to youtube
07:47:27 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi6FcI2wFrw
07:48:11 <motbob> oh that's why my videos are so loved by youtube
07:48:14 <motbob> minutes watched
07:48:24 <motbob> let me check my avg minutes watched
07:49:06 <Camail> also if you watch a video after yours from the recommended videos area
07:50:13 <Camail> basically, anything that keeps you on youtube longer
07:50:18 <Camail> which works GREAT for them
07:50:26 <Camail> kills an entire indie industry
07:50:31 <motbob> these statements from youtube don't actually imply that raw minutes watched are the important metric (rather than %)
07:50:47 <Camail> something similar must've happened tho
07:52:40 <Camail> which statements are you looking at
07:54:04 <motbob> well i guess I spoke too soon
07:54:56 <motbob> i can see how it would be a lot more valuable to youtube to have a video that encourages people to look at related videos
07:55:10 <Camail> the important part is that it defines what 'quality content is' which means better ads, more ads, and the like, I think
07:55:27 <motbob> ya
07:56:24 <motbob> average view durations: 15:50, 28:13, 20:59, 10:36, 15:40
07:56:26 <motbob> l o l
07:57:10 <motbob> those are my top 5 videos this month
07:57:42 <motbob> well, it helps when you make 40m-2h videos
07:57:51 <Camail> was jsuta bout to say that :P
07:57:57 <motbob> but here's the thing
07:58:01 <motbob> i don't even run video ads
07:58:04 <Camail> also I'm sorry about you're username
07:58:10 <motbob> so youtube doesn't make a dime
07:58:19 <motbob> what do you mean
07:58:31 <Camail> your url
07:58:41 <motbob> 20xXmotbob20Xx
07:58:47 <motbob> that's a sick url
07:58:55 <Camail> yea, i imagine you just wanted the meat and not the whole ascii sandwich
07:59:06 <Camail> i refuse to believe you and I'll leave it at that
07:59:19 <motbob> well isn't it funny? (ya motbob was taken but I think this is good too)
07:59:33 <motbob> you know what 20XX is right? do you at least see the joke?
08:00:03 <Camail> 20xx as in the year 20XX?
08:00:22 <motbob> ya, it's a SSBM meme

08:01:27 <Camail> i get it, sure
08:02:12 <motbob> wait, i'm gonna try to change it to motbob again
08:02:21 <Camail> and its clever, combining the memes, but the reason everyone makes fun of xXx420_no_scopexXx is because its so garish
08:02:25 <Camail> its like the deadpool game
08:02:36 <Camail> it makes fun of the bad things games do, thne it does them
08:03:13 <motbob> i will choose the funny option at all costs even when it doesn't really work
08:03:26 <motbob> otherwise the channel name would be motbob SSBM or something, URGH
08:03:33 <Camail> heh
08:03:56 <Camail> putting games in names is never a good idea
08:04:05 * Camail looks at bio_hon
08:04:53 <motbob> YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
08:04:59 <motbob> it worked! i changed it!
08:05:12 <Camail> nice
08:05:17 <motbob> i tried to use motbob when i first set my custom url and it didn't work, but now it does
08:05:34 <motbob> i always wondered about that, since there wasn't an existing motbob channel
08:05:59 <motbob> oh no, it just changed the youtube/c/ link LOL
08:06:14 <motbob> ok let's see if we can change the youtube/ link
08:07:34 <motbob> well i don't know, maybe it will change the youtube.com/ link later
08:10:28 <motbob> ok well youtube.com/motbob and youtube.com/c/motbob both go to my channel but the URL still changes to youtube.com/user/20xx etc.
08:12:03 <Camail> you would probably need to request a custom url
08:12:06 <Camail> unless you already did
08:12:29 <Camail> i tihnk ur account is elligble
08:13:05 <Camail> no wait
08:13:10 <Camail> i think you're super stuck with it
08:13:29 <motbob> probably
08:13:32 <Camail> m-maybe?
08:13:42 <Camail> for example: https://www.youtube.com/jessecox
08:13:48 <Camail> it goes to jessecox, doesnt redirect
08:13:50 <Camail> but
08:13:57 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/user/OMFGcata still exists
08:14:30 <Camail> but the user jessecox doesnt exist
08:15:07 <Camail> also motbob do you have any interest in firewatch, if you ahvent heard of it you should check it out

08:16:01 <Camail> youtube is weird

08:16:37 <motbob> i have staked my claim over all other motbobs
08:18:41 <motbob> wow
08:18:52 <motbob> i can block all users under the age of 21 from my channel
08:19:01 <motbob> actually i can block everyone from a specific country
08:19:14 <motbob> i'm going to block everyone over 30 and from lithuania
08:20:15 <Camail> 31 year old lithuanians are forced to forget you even exist
08:20:36 <Crisium> racist
08:20:59 <Camail> they deserve it
08:21:07 <motbob> oh fuck i can't do it because google took away my youtube partnership ROFL
08:21:14 <motbob> gotta wait until my suspension is over
08:21:59 <Camail> lol
08:22:36 <motbob> can you tell i;m still salty about this
08:22:58 <motbob> better not link your videos on reddit or youtube will say you paid for viewbots asdfsgon
08:23:53 <Camail> lol
08:24:11 <Camail> i imagine it was entirely automated detection
08:24:58 <Camail> god I like karin's designs so much
08:25:08 <Camail> the bitch laugh is the bessssssst
08:26:24 <motbob> http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/
08:27:05 <Camail> i moved over to using RSS so now i dont seem them asap
08:27:07 <Camail> which is sad
08:27:18 <Camail> though i think we all know whats about to happen
08:27:27 <motbob> i don't know what's about to happen
08:27:47 <Camail> well, look at her hair int he last panel
08:27:51 <Camail> something is going to explode
08:27:57 <Camail> figuratively, or literally
08:28:03 <motbob> well yes
08:28:09 <Camail> or both
08:28:36 <Camail> probably THAT guy
08:28:41 <Camail> that would be fun
08:29:27 <motbob> who's annie gonna bone in the end
08:30:18 <motbob> i suspect that fire elemental descendants have a strong impulse to bone after a certain point in life
08:30:23 <motbob> i wonder how that's gonna turn out
08:30:33 <Camail> its possible
08:30:51 <Camail> but she's smack dab i the middle of puberty right now and we havent gotten clear contentders
08:31:08 <Camail> shadow x annie
08:31:11 <Camail> my otp
08:31:14 <motbob> the middle huh. how old is she
08:31:21 <Camail> isnt she a ten ager
08:31:26 <Camail> teenager*
08:31:48 <Camail> puberty in girls starts earlier, as early as 10 i think?
08:32:20 <motbob> the wiki says she's 15 so ya
08:32:34 <motbob> i thought she was older. i regret talking about her boning
08:32:39 <Camail> lol
08:32:50 <Camail> I mean, its a real thing kids her age do

08:33:19 <motbob> yes. however, i'm 26
08:33:26 <Camail> but in terms of the actual narrative tools tom uses, he really hasn't used romance for annie for awhile
08:33:32 <Camail> well, there are certian ways to talk about it
08:33:42 <Camail> as long as you aren't breathing heavily i think we're in the clear
08:34:37 <motbob> the first "romance" was so wonderful. highlight of the comic. made annie a lot more interesting. manipulative ice queen annie.
08:35:07 <motbob> or no, she had been to the forest so i guess she wasn't ice queen
08:35:21 <Camail> who was the pairing, i cant recal
08:35:24 <Camail> annie and jack?
08:36:08 <motbob> yes
08:36:26 <Camail> that was a weird one
08:36:29 <Camail> jack is weird
08:37:04 <Camail> I think I might like this current arc the most, depending on the resolution
08:37:33 <Camail> I know my bias though, because I'm a sucker for revelations about mysterious characters and stuff
08:39:05 <Camail> i should probably reread it, it's been years
08:39:43 <Camail> lol, EG's FGC player manager has a twitch staff icon
08:40:14 <Camail> oh how consequences spread
08:40:44 <Camail> Crisium playing birdie now
08:40:52 <Crisium> ya im still watching
08:40:54 <Camail> justin's birdie is so different
08:41:10 <Camail> birdie's damage tho
08:41:51 <Crisium> mike ross thinks birdie is good so must be true
08:42:57 <Camail> nah
08:43:08 <Camail> he just plays the black character
08:43:24 <Camail> which is on record to be the first reason he plays a character
08:43:41 <Crisium> but birdie used to white
08:43:46 <Crisium> he is reverse michael jackson
08:44:12 <Camail> cant be white with lips like dat

21:06:45 <DuB`> She's one of the more interesting heroes!

21:06:50 <DuB`> Or something.
21:07:02 <DoT`> i dont know, thats just a guess
21:07:13 <DuB`> Ah.
21:07:35 <DoT`> maybe one of his teammates mains tracer so his practice there would be wasted

21:17:27 <Rawr|Fone> D:
21:17:36 <Runbunny> Knowing the danish postal service, it would probably be in no safe condition to eat sadly.
21:20:41 <DoT`> i dont plan to eat rawr
21:21:48 <Runbunny> I am not sure I can trust you...
21:23:53 <DuB`> Dot what exactly do you think that burgers are for?

21:41:44 <Crisium> im not sure its steam tho
21:41:48 <Crisium> steams counter is still off
21:41:52 <Crisium> might be ps4 only
21:41:56 <Crisium> and its UK only at that time
21:42:25 <Crisium> Steam still says 21 hours =\
21:42:53 <Crisium> Europe........Feb. 16 @0:00AM UK (UTC+00:00)  AUS/NZ.......Feb. 16 @11:00AM Sydney (UTC+10:00)  Americas.....Feb. 16 @0:00AM EST (Feb. 15@9:00PM PST)  Asia.............Feb. 17 @2:00AM JST (UTC+09:00) 
21:43:14 <Crisium> but thats only confirmed for ps4 so far
21:44:47 <Camail> its on the steam newsletter
21:45:12 <Camail> so i assume its for steam too
21:45:13 <Crisium> it is, but if the game is tied to the steam timer then they havent updated it
21:45:25 <Crisium> im not sure is steam timer is an actual check or not

22:45:45 <Camail> Crisium  markman was laid off
22:45:53 <Camail> which is weird because i thought he quit last year
22:46:00 <Crisium> no
22:46:03 <Camail> but apparently is was just an announcement for quitting later this year
22:46:05 <Crisium> he left voluntarily
22:46:08 <Camail> no
22:46:14 <Camail> he was TECHNICALLY
22:46:15 <Camail> liad off
22:46:19 <Camail> he got a severence package
22:46:40 <Crisium> well good for him
22:46:46 <Crisium> i also know he was planning to leave this year
22:46:51 <Camail> https://twitter.com/MarkMan23/status/699362809180651520
22:46:52 <Crisium> might as well get the cash
22:46:54 <Camail> yea
22:47:01 <Camail> it seemed like a really good deal
22:48:42 <Camail> dub
22:48:43 <Camail> no
22:48:44 <Camail> dont leave
22:48:45 <Camail> you cant
22:48:47 <Camail> stay here please
22:48:50 <Camail> or die
22:49:07 <DuB`off> I was ABOUT to say I was touched, you haven't shown that you want me here much.
22:49:09 <DuB`off> But then "die".
22:49:28 <DuB`off> And I MUST dissapoint you by going to buy food so that I do not in fact die.
22:49:32 <DuB`off> Because that is my role.
22:49:38 <Camail> I'm so mad capcom pro talks isnt on their youtube yet
22:49:59 * Camail kills dub
22:50:16 * DuB`off is gone so it's too late.
22:50:25 <Camail> unlikely

23:01:12 <Camail> cris the motion blur on pc is awful
23:01:13 <Crisium> ya im turning off the motion blur
23:01:29 <DoT`> always turn off motion blur
23:01:46 <Crisium> PC will look better if everything but blur is maxed, but otherwise PS4 looks clearer actually with the damn blur
23:02:08 <Camail> yea sad they didnt turn off blur
23:02:30 <Camail> DF clearly doesnt have a staff that palys fighting games...
23:02:37 <Camail> no one int heir right mind would play with that
23:02:46 <Camail> oh hay lets make the animations harder to see
23:02:49 <Camail> thats a good idea right
23:03:23 <Crisium> such a bad idea
23:03:37 <Crisium> i want to be able to clearly know what button my opponent pressed
23:03:41 <Camail> luckily its only on pc
23:03:48 <Crisium> ya, so we can turn it off
23:03:55 <Camail> and its not gonna be an issue at tournaments
23:03:56 <Crisium> PS4's would be screwed if it were default there
23:04:01 <Camail> having to turn it off on every station
23:04:23 <Camail> tfw i dont even know the standards for video options on consoles
23:04:29 <Camail> havent owned one since the wii
23:04:35 <Crisium> they rarely have any actually
23:04:53 <Camail> thanks god the ps4 isn't slightly stronger\
23:05:07 <Crisium> ha, first i heard that ever said
23:05:12 <Crisium> except from xbone fanboys
23:09:18 <Crisium> ah steam updated it
23:09:21 <Crisium> 6 hours for USA
23:09:27 <Crisium> 1 hour for EU

23:14:11 <Camail> wait what, lupe isn't good at fighting games
23:14:29 <Camail> I assume you've seen his tweets
23:14:38 <Crisium> but my steam country is US, and if i change it to UK im stuck for 2 weeks there which is probably not a problem since i wont buy anything soon anyway

23:24:13 <Camail> this match is literally a joke
23:24:14 <Crisium> and another with lupe vs other celebrity
