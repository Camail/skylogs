20:46:07 <Camail> then 100% one of us will get a code
20:46:15 <Camail> then tomorrow is the last day i think
20:46:36 <Camail> or today is the last day
20:47:07 <DoT`> its 6 days
20:48:21 <Camail> ok so me, you, a person you give a code to, and today's code
20:48:28 <Camail> so we have 4 people out of 5
20:48:30 <Camail> thats good enough
20:48:43 <Camail> maybe eventually I'll get a code from when i signed up for the closed beta
20:49:30 <DoT`> YOLT
20:49:34 <DoT`> its neeb tie!
20:49:36 <DoT`> time
20:53:10 <Camail> mane EU sucks at fighting games
20:53:17 <Camail> man*
20:53:34 <Camail> dreamhack is 6 patriots and 2 cowards
20:58:27 <DoT`> well i cant even log into my greybox account... locked myself out twice
20:59:02 <DoT`> i just want them to reset my password, like thats the first test, if im an idiot who recorded the wrong password
20:59:10 <DoT`> after that we can go into troubleshooting
21:01:28 <Camail> well you can send yourelf an email right
21:01:33 <DoT`> no
21:01:35 <Camail> or do you also need your old password
21:01:40 <DoT`> there reset password thing is borked
21:01:48 <Camail> there's no "forgot your passowrd" option?
21:01:48 <DoT`> the link just sends you back to your own account page
21:01:54 <Camail> hmm
21:01:55 <DoT`> i have told them this
21:01:57 <Camail> dumb
21:02:47 <DoT`> silly greybox site only gives you 2 attempts to log in before locking your accout for 15 minutes
21:03:23 <DoT`> I have A LOT of passwords i could have used isntead of the one i meant to
21:04:57 <DoT`> GG neeb!
21:07:07 <DoT`> Phearlock beep
21:07:32 <Phearlock> hm?
21:07:49 <DoT`> i pm you key
21:07:58 <Phearlock> oh
21:08:00 <Phearlock> cool
21:09:34 <Phearlock> I will get to installing thing
21:09:58 <Camail> I've played the sniper 95% of the time
21:10:48 <DoT`> in the streams i onyl ever saw that ship getting picked on, but when it hit things it hurt them a lot
21:11:46 <carcinisation> dreams are over :(
21:11:47 <Camail> because people suck at it
21:12:02 <DoT`> aww reif
21:12:13 <DoT`> you can watch neeb win reif https://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacksc2
21:12:20 <Camail> If i tay 5km+ away people usually can't hit me
21:12:36 <Camail> you just shuffle up and down, its a thing ship so its hard to hit when its moving vertically
21:12:54 <carcinisation> 77 shove utg got snap called by utg+1 with A4s lol. and then he made the flush...
21:13:04 <Camail> also with the svarog it has a slow reload and 1 bullet each, so shoot, hide while reloading, repeat
21:13:07 <DoT`> i mainly saw them getting killed by cloacking smaller ships gettign close
21:13:33 <Camail> if the corsair focus entirely on you maybe
21:13:41 <Camail> but you can see cloak if you look for it
21:14:00 <Camail> and if you can hit it with a sniper shot before it gets to you you can out DPS it
21:14:11 <carcinisation> on main event had AA vs 65s tried to trap when i flopped a set and he made a flush :(
21:14:15 <Camail> also stay kinda close to your team if they are doing that
21:14:28 <DoT`> i think corsairs often focus snipers because they are so good if left alone and easly killed once you are close
21:14:30 <DoT`> but i have not played, so cant give proper opionions
21:14:43 <DoT`> just form what i have seen
21:14:49 <Camail> its not hard to counter corasiars unless they're really good
21:15:00 <Camail> they have to be really good at flying to make it hard to shoot them
21:15:17 <Camail> I've only had one MM game with a good corsair
