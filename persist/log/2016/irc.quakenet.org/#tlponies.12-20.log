00:05:48 <Camail> hello 100 up
00:05:52 <Camail> its been 2 years since we've last met
00:06:10 <Camail> back when i was in college i was a different man, I've matured
00:06:20 <Camail> now we can have a stronger relationship
00:06:59 <Camail> I've noticed how thick your bandwidth has gotten
00:07:02 <Camail> I don't mind
00:07:29 <Dot> oh its an intenret company
00:07:38 <Camail> fiber optics
00:07:46 <Camail> i just chortened it
00:07:55 <Camail> to go along with the sensual stuff
00:08:32 <Camail> this means i can do all the internet things again, i am flush with options
00:08:38 <Camail> engorged with choice
00:08:45 <Dot> \o/
00:09:02 <Camail> quivering with possibilities
00:10:21 <Camail> weird thing: pinging to a texas server i get 2 down and 10 up still
00:10:30 <Camail> oh also i meant 100 down , not up
00:10:48 <Dot> i was immpressed
00:10:50 <Dot> not anymore
00:11:41 <Camail> you wound me
00:11:49 <Camail> guess i wont start steaming
00:11:56 <Camail> seeing as even my friends hate me
00:12:11 <Dot> well you lied to me cam
00:12:18 <Dot> i will take time to recover
00:12:24 <Camail> how much time
00:12:28 <Dot> im done
00:12:57 <Dot> im in a relativly good mood atm
00:13:07 <Camail> nice
00:13:21 <Camail> my mood has improved since I stopped playing overwatch
00:13:35 <Dot> haha
00:13:45 <Dot> that is sad though
00:14:00 <Camail> I kept trying to make myself like the game
00:14:03 <Dot> we need a game
00:14:17 <Camail> it made me irritated and resentful
00:14:34 <Camail> if i start the game and get tilted before entering a match, i dont have much hope
00:15:18 <Camail> i have a plan dot
00:15:26 <Camail> for a tlp game
00:15:32 <Camail> but the time is not right

00:15:38 <Camail> aka its not christmas yet
00:15:44 <Dot> cunnign plans?
00:15:49 <Dot> ooo
00:15:52 <Dot> very cunning
00:16:51 <Camail> so the ISP we have was shit for 5 years because the guy who owned it was really old and shitty
00:17:03 <Camail> his son bought him out and started working on imrpoving the infrastructure
00:17:15 <Camail> and apparently we finally are fully fiber'd up in our town
00:17:23 <Dot> nice!
00:17:33 <Camail> we only have 7k people in our town so fiber is even better here than in some cities now
00:17:38 <Camail> yay bandwidth
00:18:04 <Dot> bakewell only has 3k people, no fiber for us though
00:18:41 <Camail> buy those fiber optic novelty toys
00:18:51 <Camail> and connect the fiber and lay it on the ground
00:18:53 <Camail> bam
00:19:21 <Dot> i will be rich!
00:20:22 <Camail> fiber is a tech where literally the only issue is cost
00:20:32 <Camail> its nuts
