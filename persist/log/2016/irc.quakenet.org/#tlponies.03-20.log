19:38:09 <Crisium> stardew patch 
19:38:10 <Crisium> With version 1.06, the first steps are taken to improving marriage in Stardew Valley! Each marriage candidate now has a unique dialogue sheet, and leaves the house at least once a week to visit town or take a walk. In short, they retain a lot more of their unique "personality" after marriage.  Changelog: Added unique dialogues for all marriage candidates. Marriage candidates now leave the house on mondays. Value of most animal prod
19:38:38 <Crisium> i was using a lot of hollies for food while mining, oh well
19:41:56 <DoT|Phone1> the problem with pirated. I want marriage updates
