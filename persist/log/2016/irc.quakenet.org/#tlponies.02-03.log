00:12:47 <reification> http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/?icanputanythinghere
00:13:14 <DoT`> im bad at internet after midnight
00:13:20 <DoT`> best excuse i have
00:14:00 <DoT`> neeb bringing the collosi back so he has a use for the skin
00:14:54 <reification> pheonix had one job
00:15:08 <Camail> http://www.twitch.tv/sgares
00:15:12 <Camail> ok cool
00:15:23 <DoT`> i played shoots today cam!
00:15:29 <Camail> so new sweetie is up to date with old sweetie now
00:15:29 <DoT`> and most of it went aweful
00:15:38 <Camail> thats how it works
00:15:45 <Camail> your mmr is still way higher than it should be
00:15:52 <DoT`> ended on a 20/3 game, but otherwise bad
00:15:52 <Camail> well, probably not as much as it was
00:15:59 <DoT`> went one round where i had 1 kill at round 8
00:16:11 <DuB`> That's the old colosssus skin, though!
00:16:26 <DoT`> well he hasnt unlocked the new one yet dub
00:16:33 <DoT`> patch isnt out
00:16:33 <Camail> it happens dot
00:16:36 <DuB`> Well he's a pro he should hurry up.
00:16:38 <DuB`> Oh.
00:16:40 <Camail> was it on ct?
00:16:48 <DoT`> yea, just get annoyed at myself when i fail so bad
00:16:49 <DoT`> yea
00:16:58 <Camail> i figured
00:17:07 <Camail> thats gonna happen soetimes on ct
00:17:21 <DoT`> suppose
00:17:31 <Camail> there are two ways that happens
00:17:48 <Camail> 1. you are uncomfortable in your spot, and they just come in and like 3v1 you and you dont trade
00:17:57 <Camail> 2. they always go to the other sites and you die on retake
00:18:20 <DoT`> i got halv to play now, so just have to get him through casuals 
00:18:31 <Camail> it just means that you havent quite learned how to handle T agression
00:18:33 <Camail> which is hard
00:18:45 <Camail> it requires patience and a feeling for timings on T pushes
00:19:15 <Camail> especially when you havent had time to learn consistent aim
00:19:15 <DoT`> hmm, i might need to find a list on how long it takes to go between points on the map >.>
00:19:49 <Camail> eh
00:19:56 <Camail> thats tertiary
00:20:09 <DoT`> gg neeb
00:20:25 <reification> rage gg?
00:20:26 <Camail> that matters for T fakes and some retakes but there's more important things to learn
00:20:36 <DoT`> like how to shoot
00:21:09 <Camail> well yes, but like, even other non skill based things
00:22:38 <BioSC> lol what
00:22:49 <DoT`> bayu
00:22:55 <BioSC> all of a sudden I go from 2 down .5 up to 22 down 3 up?
00:23:00 <BioSC> the hell is going on ISP
00:23:40 <DuB`> :(
00:23:48 <DoT`> DUB
00:23:50 <BioSC> well, hopefully it stays that way
00:24:01 * DuB` gives bayo some internet.
00:24:05 <DuB`> plsss
00:24:33 <BioSC> its a good  thing now, but holy carp
00:24:40 <BioSC> its been all over the place this week
00:24:48 <DoT`> camail, you should stream when you play cs sometime
00:24:54 <DoT`> or does your intenret say no
00:25:01 <Camail> ^
00:25:16 <DoT`> bleh
00:25:24 <Camail> usually my internet isnt evne close to good enough
00:25:29 <BioSC> try steam broadcast
00:25:35 <BioSC> sometimes it works better
00:25:52 <Camail> you underestimate the badness of my internet
00:26:01 <Camail> I was just getting .3 down
00:27:38 * DuB` gives camail a LOT of internet.
00:27:38 <DuB`> D:
00:28:38 <BioSC> I'm not sure exactly how it works, but I think that steam fronts the bill for the "streaming" part
00:30:18 <Camail> I mean, i can try right now if you wanna play
00:31:01 <reification> nuke \o/
00:31:03 <DoT`> NUUUKE
00:31:53 <DoT`> its nice to see collosi again

00:32:45 <DuB`> Once in a while is nice!
00:35:36 <DoT`> poor zealot
00:35:39 <DoT`> he did his best
00:38:44 <DoT`> im enjoying learnign smokes/flashs atm cam, though some ive seen are fir very specific situations
00:38:52 <DoT`> just focusing on usefull looking ones
00:39:32 <DuB`> I wanna shoots with my new monitor keyboard and mouse!
00:39:39 <Camail> only learn the easy ones
00:39:39 <DuB`> Am ready to be pro now mkay.
00:39:44 <Camail> no jump smokes
00:40:05 <DoT`> oh i tried one of those in offline, HAAH, took a few tries
00:40:15 <DoT`> i would never try it in game probably yet
00:40:27 <Camail> there's very few easy ones
00:40:46 <Camail> if the smoke is easy it doesnt matter which frame you release on
00:40:50 <Camail> but every frame is different
00:41:03 <Camail> and the tickrate affects the jump velocity for each frame
00:41:03 <DoT`> it took me a few thrws even to notice the change in distance
00:41:09 <Camail> and jumps cripts were banned
00:41:22 <DoT`> cripts?
00:41:25 <Camail> do you have the grenade trajectory turned on?
00:41:39 <DoT`> yea, in offline
00:41:45 <Camail> k
00:42:07 <Camail> yea, the most important smokes on T are the ones that block of rotators
00:42:11 <DoT`> and unlimited grenades!
00:42:15 <Camail> eyup
00:42:27 <Camail> ct grenades are usually just on the fly

00:42:48 <Camail> as long as you're having fun learning them its fine
00:42:58 <DoT`> there was a funny flash in dust 2 from mid, bouncing it off the rise over the wall ninto B
00:43:08 <Camail> i sppuose i should change the youtube plugin to not ping
00:43:12 <Camail> and the twitch one
00:43:21 <Camail> its not entirely useful to ping...
00:44:00 <Camail> yea thats a good flash but hard to pull off
00:44:31 <Camail> most of the time you are gonna just be doing a support flash, which means standing a bit back and flashing your teammates in, or getting god at right clicking
00:45:42 <Camail> its almsot always better to right click flashes than to bank them
00:47:27 <DoT`> everytime i try bring a grenade out its highly likly im going to just get shot
00:47:47 <Camail> never pull out a grenade when you know someone is near you
00:48:11 <Camail> if you just shot at a guy, never ever pull back behind the corner in order to throw a pop flash
00:48:14 <Camail> or a smoke
00:48:26 <Camail> the only time you ever do that is when you are running away from the engagement completely
00:48:40 <Camail> so repositioning + flash is a good tactic
00:48:59 <Camail> but panic nades are going to kill you
00:49:53 <Camail> flashes are also used to initiate
00:50:39 <Camail> also never peek with a nade out with the purpose of throwing it
00:51:01 <Camail> bank HE nades and smokes, dont expose yourself to angles where they could be
00:51:01 <DoT`> i know i souldnt do that, but it happens
00:51:52 <DoT`> "everyone voted so hard the palace caught on fire" lol

01:28:33 <BioSC> sometimes
01:31:23 <Camail> oh, i was talking to dot after that
01:31:30 <Camail> i was mre bugging you if you wanted to play
01:34:24 <BioSC> hmm
01:34:26 <BioSC> gimme like 1h
01:34:28 <BioSC> ish
01:34:31 <BioSC> k
01:34:32 <BioSC> k
01:35:58 <Camail> DoT`  there's three tpyes of aim training that you can do, normal deathmatch, aim maps, and custom training maps
01:36:18 <Camail> they all matter to some degree
01:36:18 <DoT`> i have number 1 and 2
01:36:28 <DoT`> i recall aim maps from cs1.6
01:36:36 <DoT`> thats the last time i ever played one
01:37:01 <DoT`> 1 and 3*
01:38:18 <DoT`> training_aim_csgo2, its all orange and white
01:38:43 <DoT`> actually its the traning map you showed me
01:40:31 <Camail> ya thats the one
01:40:50 <Camail> aim maps like p2000 and redline are good 
01:41:07 <Camail> it helps to train how to pre aim, how to expose less of your body while fighting
01:41:30 <Camail> how to retreat, how to aim at head level, pre firing
01:41:39 <DoT`> i have taken not of those names
01:41:44 <Camail> ironically all the stuff that goes with aiming, but isnt aiming
01:42:37 <Camail> you train you're raw aim in deathmatch where you don't know where they are going to be and you only have the simplest  pre-aiming around every corner
01:42:50 <DoT`> im a bit confused on prefiring, as you shoot as you go around the corner, but you must not move and shoot
01:43:34 <Camail> also i dunno if this will help you because i dont know how you aim, but if you tend to flail your mouse and move way to far when trying to snap onto an enemy, the best thing you can do is relax your hand
01:43:54 <Camail> it makes you have slower, shorter movements
01:44:05 <Camail> and also you panic a lot less when you force yourself to not tense up
01:44:10 <DoT`> will try keep that in mind
01:44:44 <DoT`> i dont think i flail, but will try pay attention just incase
01:45:02 <DoT`> but i do tense up
01:45:09 <Camail> I practice relaxed aiming in training modes, then during games I force myself to calm down and remember those techniques
01:45:17 <Camail> if you tense upt hen you flail
01:45:18 <Camail> 100%
01:46:01 <DoT`> ok, will practice calmness
01:46:51 <DoT`> this terran is pretty good
01:47:17 <Camail> I've found that my mind follows my body to some degree, if you just take a second to go behind a wall, exhale, calm down, and refocus
01:47:45 <Camail> it is a crucial reset that will help with dame decisions and aim
01:47:54 <Camail> game*

15:17:49 <DoT`> whats happened today skrammenen
15:19:22 <Phearlaptop> Poor girl
15:19:42 <Phearlaptop> I missed some of those conversations in my playthrough
15:19:58 <DoT`> i think i missed a lot of them
15:20:08 <DoT`> didnt realise they carried on so many times
15:20:09 <skram> I didnt catch it in one of my 90 playthroughs
15:23:55 <DoT`> time for 91 then skram
15:24:09 <skram> im waiting for me4 now :p
15:24:15 <DoT`> oh ya
15:24:20 <DoT`> when is that due?
15:24:32 <skram> couple years at least
15:24:53 <DoT`> is it going to take place before me1? how they plan to work it
15:25:07 <skram> post me3
15:25:17 <skram> and not about shepard
15:25:31 <DoT`> i hope they base it off the worst of the 4 endings
15:25:32 <DoT`> :P
15:26:11 <skram> afaik its gonna be based on the destroy ending
15:26:16 <Phearlaptop> More cute aliens please.
15:26:51 <DoT`> i only recall the green endig skram
15:27:00 <DoT`> and i never looked at what the added ending was
15:27:08 <DoT`> maybe when i get around to playing through the game again
15:27:54 <skram> they dont really differ much honestly
15:27:56 <skram> different colors
15:28:17 <DoT`> i dont know, i dont think the others had everything turn half half
15:29:00 <DoT`> and if i recall all the reapers live in one of the choices
15:29:05 <DoT`> seems pretty big
15:29:51 <skram> its just a 30 second cut scene with different colors and then another 20 second cut scene with stuff
15:30:06 <DoT`> well i mean thats what an ending is really
15:30:19 <DoT`> a story and stuff
15:30:21 <Phearlaptop> Needed screenshot ending with narration of what happened to each char aka Baldurs gate style
15:30:36 <skram> like the DA series did
15:30:42 <Phearlaptop> yeah
15:30:49 <DoT`> and neverwinter if i recall
15:31:00 <Phearlaptop> And fallout had that thing of what happened to each town
15:31:29 <Phearlaptop> well, most fallouts, fo4 had too little of that
15:32:21 <skram> fo4 ending was kidna shit
15:32:31 <Phearlaptop> yes
15:32:36 <Phearlaptop> Obsidian plz fix
15:32:50 <CockRoach|42> volvo will save the day
15:32:58 <skram> but the hundreds of hundreds of hours of gameplay and content made up for that
15:33:08 <DoT`> like skyrim i will probably never finish the main quest on fo4
15:33:09 <DoT`> >.>
15:33:09 <Phearlaptop> Yeah I liked fallout 4 a lot
15:33:26 <Phearlaptop> Volvo would just make it end on a cliffhanger and be like "is ok we continue it in fallout 4 ep 1"
15:33:30 <Phearlaptop> and then that never happens
15:33:39 <DoT`> no ending to be bad
15:33:39 <CockRoach|42> :D
15:33:42 <BioSC> nicememe
15:37:24 <skram> afaik theres only one ending where shepard survived so they probably gonna base it on that DoT`

17:17:45 <DoT`> reif, you asked about maphackers with the WCS taking top 16 gm, ppl are just as lickly to use them in in this qualifier
17:18:07 <DoT`> i think top 16 gm is pretty safe form maphackers and the like, at that level they would be found out quick

17:44:35 <DoT`> :)
17:54:35 <reification> dot i think smart use of hacking, e.g. production tab, would be hard to detect and give big boost
17:54:57 <reification> when i see ppl caught hacking they usually have done something stupid to get caught
17:55:15 <DoT`> but i think its just as likely in the normal qualifiers as top 16 gm
17:55:38 <DoT`> as the other 15 ppl in GM would have played that guy a ton and they are all pretty good at the game
17:55:49 <DoT`> top 15*
17:57:01 <DoT`> I just tihnk when blizzard goes "here are the top 32 from ladder" anyone in there that hacks will have peacked the suspicion of the others
17:57:02 <reification> maybe you right
17:57:28 <reification> but i thought blizz did something like this before and known hackers got in
17:57:33 <DoT`> more so at least than for instance the current qualifier with over 128 ppl taking part
18:05:00 <reification> 5 more flips to win…
18:05:34 <DoT`> gl!
18:05:50 <DoT`> is it a coin flip as in 50/50?
18:06:24 <reification> yes
18:06:31 <DoT`> ouch
18:06:50 <reification> tho in poker flip can also mean close to 50/50 ie 47/53
18:08:27 <reification> the ‘weekly windfall’ that happens wed evening is a 6 handed flip tourney so that’s more like rolling a regular dice
18:08:55 <DoT`> so each person out of 6 has a number?
18:09:57 <reification> no is run like regular poker tournament but all in every hand
