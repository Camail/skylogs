02:41:36 <Bio> G FUCKING G
02:41:43 <ZK> WTF
02:41:46 <Phant> Yesterday I was playing Reinhardt.
02:41:46 <ZK> THAT WAS NOT A GOOD GOAL
02:41:54 <Camail> also DoT`  wouldnt you get made if you were doing algebra and solved for x, but then y fucked up a flash and you got the problem wrong
02:42:00 <Phant> And a DVA tried to use her ulti on the capture point and ran behind a wall.
02:42:04 <Camail> mad*
02:42:16 <Phant> I used my charge to take the bomb into the alley and it killed her and myself only.
02:42:26 <DoT`> y is only joking so is ok
02:42:27 <Phant> I bet that guy was surprised.
02:42:29 <DoT`> i rub him out
02:42:38 <Camail> maybe y just sucks
02:43:00 <DoT`> but y tries hard so no nead to be mad at him
02:43:08 <Camail> but you got the problem wrong
02:43:12 <Camail> you failed
02:43:21 <Camail> and this was a 40 question test
02:43:28 <Camail> and you got 30 quesitons wrong because of y
02:43:30 <Camail> the test took 2 hours
02:43:35 <Camail> two hours failing, because of y
02:43:50 <Camail> maybe you still want to do math with y
02:44:02 <Camail> but no doubt any human being witohut the patience of a saint will be worn down by then
02:44:10 <ZK> what?
02:44:14 <Camail> we can only math for so long until we want to be right sometimes
02:44:20 <DoT`> cams explaining why bio is mad
02:44:23 <Camail> dont worry about it zk
02:48:01 <DuB`> Phant: Rein + dva ult stuff is fun. :P
02:48:57 <Phant> The best part was the kill cam of myself.
02:49:06 <Camail> I'm really just explaining why anyone gets mad at someone else in a team game, I'm a pretty typical case in terms of type, but not degree of anger
02:49:11 <Phant> She is staring at the wall, then turns and sees me and tried to back pedal.
02:49:13 <Camail> or even type of anger really
02:49:45 <DoT`> i know
02:49:53 <DoT`> but is only game
02:49:55 <Camail> I'm not angry at anyone in particular its all just frustration that translates into silence or a kinda aggressive chastising 
02:50:08 <Camail> oh i was just saying that to annoy bio
02:50:19 <DoT`> yes
02:50:34 <Camail> .tag dot y

17:15:43 <ZK> At least that's the intention
17:15:49 <ZK> it... doesnt work out as well
17:17:04 <DoT`> cane, the bracket break is in is super harsh
17:17:21 <DoT`> i saw it last week
17:17:26 <Cane> How does this even work?
17:17:35 <DoT`> most of the top players ended up in one of the 4 brackets
17:17:43 -!- Frigo [~Frigo@catv-80-99-5-67.catv.broadband.hu] has joined #tlponies
17:17:52 <DoT`> they play 4 brackets and take the elo
17:18:09 <DoT`> which takes kills, time alive, stuff like that into account
17:18:10 <Cane> Yeah but is it just a big free for all or do they limit it or what? I have no idea what I'm about to look at.
17:18:23 <Phearlock> ^
17:18:26 <Phearlock> Dot plz explain
17:18:30 <DoT`> so +/- 50 ppl get dropped out a moving plane
17:18:38 <DoT`> they then choose when to deploy thier parachute
17:18:39 <Cane> Okay so it's a big free for all.
17:18:43 <DoT`> they have nothing on them
17:18:53 <DoT`> yea, so then they have to scatter for stff
17:18:55 <ZK> what game are you talking about DoT`?
17:19:00 <Cane> Battle Royale in Arma 3.
17:19:04 <Phearlock> So it's basically the Culling in Arma 3
17:19:08 <Phearlock> with 50 ppl
17:19:18 <DoT`> teaming is allowed in some BR servers but this is a solo tourny
17:19:24 <Phearlock> Can ppl hit each other with rocks?
17:19:26 <DoT`> yes phear
17:19:29 <Phearlock> Good
17:19:29 <DoT`> no
17:19:32 <DoT`> no rocks
17:19:34 <Phearlock> Aw
17:19:38 <DoT`> i wish i could punch ppl
17:19:46 -!- Rawr|Phone [~Rawr@81-233-7-47-no34.tbcn.telia.com] has joined #tlponies
17:19:50 <Phearlock> 0/10 Maud disapproves
17:20:00 <Cane> It's Battle Royale, aka Hunger Games, aka any one of the half dozen derivatives.
17:20:06 <DoT`> yea
17:20:45 <DoT`> i think the arma one was created when ppl saw how populour it was in h1z1
17:20:59 <DoT`> but wanted it with arma realism/playstyle
17:21:20 <Phearlock> Is there any sort of player incentive to fight each other?
17:21:29 <Phearlock> Or will they generally try avoid and scavenge for a while
17:21:47 <DoT`> you get better elo for having more kills
17:21:49 <Cane> So, Halvgud recommended I watch the Arma 3 "Battle Royale" stream. I was concerned about production values and a bad spectator interface, since they run the gamut from CS:GO which has an amazing interface to Tribes which was abysmal. Halvgud said "It's about average."
17:21:52 <DoT`> but fights are dangerous
17:21:57 <Cane> Apparently "average" = no first person camera ever.
17:22:01 <Cane> So, Tribes again.
17:22:17 <DoT`> there is but wether this observer uses it
17:22:19 <DoT`> who knows
17:22:39 <Cane> None of the highlight clips used it, so I'm not expecting much.
17:22:49 <DoT`> diffrent observer today
17:22:54 <Cane> Just a bland, static, flat, wide, boring shot of people doing exciting things.
17:23:56 <DoT`> oh, http://battleroyalegames.com/   i didnt realise playerunknown was responsable for the h1z1 one as well?
17:24:16 <Phearlock> This circle is massive
17:24:20 <Phearlock> is there a time limit?
17:24:23 <DoT`> as i said, its arma
17:24:24 <DoT`> haha
17:24:31 <DoT`> the circle shrinks over time
17:24:32 <Phearlock> Because if theres like 4 left
17:24:34 <Phearlock> ok
17:25:02 <Cane> The actual game of Battle Royale is one of those things that sounds amazing and tense.
17:25:13 -!- Halvgud [webchat@ti0043a400-1988.bb.online.no] has joined #tlponies
17:25:13 <DoT`> playing on the edge of the closing circle is dangerous but a very valid strat
17:25:32 <Phearlock> just instagib if you go outside?
17:25:32 <Cane> Because you're dropped in with nothing, you have to choose when and how to deploy your parachute, and then you run, sneak, go for whatever items caches you can.
17:25:38 <Halvgud> You need your healing kits for that tho
17:25:46 <DoT`> damage aevery 15 seconds
17:26:19 <DoT`> normaly you can survive 3 ticks of being outside the circle
17:26:23 <Yolteotl> dot pon
17:26:25 <Phearlock> Parajumping seems dangerous
17:26:29 <DoT`> hardcore it might be 2?
17:26:46 <DoT`> phear, there use to be a glitch where your parachute wouldnt open
17:26:47 <Halvgud> Isn't it every 20s damage?
17:26:53 <DoT`> maybe halv
17:26:59 <Yolteotl> I'm watching pony
17:27:01 <Yolteotl> late
17:27:12 <Cane> Hahah look at that spread.
17:27:19 <DoT`> we want viss dead
17:27:22 <DoT`> he is a jerk
17:27:25 <Cane> Oh okay.
17:27:27 <Cane> Fuck you Viss.
17:27:35 <Cane> I hope you die ingame irl.
17:27:37 <Halvgud> Not a single low open chute. That's hardcore for ya :p
17:27:44 <DoT`> Nutty is in this!  he is one of the main programmers/testers i believe
17:28:18 <DoT`> the guts to go to a military base !
17:28:20 <DoT`> wow
17:28:29 <Halvgud> Shall we root for the great maker? :D
17:28:30 <Cane> Why is that an issue?
17:28:40 <Cane> I mean if you can get there, doesn't those bases have way more stuff?
17:28:47 <DoT`> cane, they are scary, because all the best loot is at military
17:28:52 <DoT`> so normaly its crowded
17:29:00 <Halvgud> Yeah, but then many will go there, so it's a high risk zone to search
17:29:20 <DoT`> and he went to one on a hill, where everyone can see you land/leave
17:29:41 <Phearlock> Do they use one of the great ARMA weapon packs or is this just vanilla loot?
17:29:46 <Cane> So weapons caches and items you can generally find in buildings, right?
17:29:49 <Cane> What tiers of caches are there?
17:29:52 <DoT`> its specific to BR
17:30:10 <DoT`> http://imgur.com/Ge6q87c
17:30:41 <DoT`> calibre rifles compared to shooting types of arma
17:30:43 <Cane> Where can you expect to find what kind of weapons?
17:31:01 <DoT`> all houses can have 5.56 and smaller
17:31:19 <DoT`> 6.5 is very rare but also in most buildings
17:31:32 <DoT`> larger is crate drops only i thnink
17:31:53 <Cane> Different types of scopes?
17:31:57 <DoT`> yea
17:32:03 <DoT`> and silencers
17:32:10 <Phearlock> There's really not much difference between 5.56, 6.5 and 7.62 in arma where just inf is concerned though.
17:32:25 <DoT`> its very complex in arma
17:32:32 <Phearlock> I do play it
17:32:39 <DoT`> due to how hitboxes and arma
17:32:40 <Halvgud> Depends on the amount of defence in gear
17:32:45 <Phearlock> different penetration metric
17:33:16 <Phearlock> But like at least unless you're running some mods, within like 300 meters 2-3 shots of 5.56 from most rifles down a dude
17:33:31 <DoT`> LOL
17:33:33 <DoT`> shame
17:33:36 <Cane> lol
17:33:53 <Halvgud> Sometimes silly ricochets from certain angles when wearing high tier armor
17:33:58 <DoT`> oh damn halv
17:34:01 <DoT`> that circle
17:34:26 <Halvgud> heh
17:34:32 <Halvgud> oh memories
17:34:37 <DoT`> it normaly spawns roughly center
17:34:41 <DoT`> then there are these times
17:34:56 <Phearlock> http://i.4cdn.org/mlp/1460827065869.png dragon waifu
17:35:12 <Halvgud> reminds me of the many times I got good shit at the edge, didn't find a vehicle in time, died. 
17:35:22 <Halvgud> RIP high tier weapon& armor
17:35:25 <DoT`> and the time you drove us OUT the main circle?
17:35:44 <Halvgud> I thought we agreed to never share that shame in public? Dot how could you! :p
17:35:58 <Halvgud> Yeah that was epic fail
17:37:01 <Halvgud> Think the caster will go "pewpewpew" for lack of sound effects? :p
17:37:05 <DoT`> that red circle is a bombardment
17:37:16 <DoT`> EXPLOSIONS
17:37:26 <DoT`> it randomly spawns around
17:38:05 <Halvgud> The epic soundtrack in the background
17:39:04 <DoT`> why do they refuse ti use fisrt person halv
17:39:29 <Halvgud> for the best possible cast? 
17:39:57 * Cane snores
17:40:01 <Cane> Yeah, this is pretty miserable.
17:40:13 <Phearlock> mostly watching CS =P
17:40:21 <DoT`> as i said, the start is low :P
17:41:16 <Halvgud> shame about the sound falling out, really cuts back on the cast.
17:41:39 <Cane> This is what I was afraid of when I asked you what kind of spectator interface and production values the stream has.
17:41:45 <Cane> You could have just said "complete shit" and saved me a lot of trouble. :P
17:42:24 -!- DuB` [DuB@66-219-213-203.dynamic.ip.veracitynetworks.com] has joined #tlponies
17:42:27 <Halvgud> I suspect I don't watch casts enough to be able to give a rating on that. :\
17:42:45 <DuB`> Upon review of the writing topics and my prepared material, I don't think I can actually do much more right now.
17:43:32 <Cane> This is worse than the spectator mode for Tribes: Ascend, and I think that's worth some kind of medal. =P
17:44:29 <Cane> So why do we have Viss?
17:44:49 <DoT`> as i said, he is a bit of a jerk
17:44:52 <Halvgud> He has the skills but not the personality.
17:46:22 <DoT`> arma bugs <3
17:48:05 <Bio> lol
17:48:12 <Bio> tribes was baaaad
17:48:14 <Halvgud> Really hope the sound bug gets fixed for the next round. Exit/restart and avoid playing that music for so long.
17:48:14 <Bio> =)
17:49:20 <DoT`> go Flux!
17:49:28 <Cane> Can players not see where they are on the map?
17:49:29 <DoT`> after such a struggle
17:49:41 <DoT`> only gps that gives co-ords
17:49:46 <Halvgud> Dot, your fav at this point?
17:50:07 <DoT`> then you have to open the map and check your c-ords against that
17:50:32 <DoT`> i recall rooting for him in the regualars halv
17:50:43 <DoT`> and i only recognise vizz in this bracket
17:51:34 <Halvgud> Break used a nifty trick by marking his own position so he knew better where he was moving with the GPS
17:52:04 <DoT`> https://www.twitch.tv/sbiggstv
17:52:09 <DoT`> this has sound
17:52:38 <Halvgud> Just based on names: SirFartalot :P
17:55:53 <Cane> Viss is playing smart. He's got the skills.
17:56:10 <DoT`> he does
17:57:43 <DoT`> bio dub
17:57:45 <Cane> The sbiggstv stream is better, it has sound and he goes third person a lot instead of just this annoying bird's eye view that shows fuck all.
17:58:12 <DoT`> yea, im watchign that one
17:58:32 <Cane> I have three monitors, got a stream on each of 'em.
17:58:41 <Cane> Feels like I have a command center.
17:58:58 <Halvgud> ah luxury

18:00:56 <DoT`> thats some scary open feild to move through
18:01:54 <Cane> Arma is my favorite "bush is made of bullet proof concrete" game.
18:02:11 <DoT`> never trust a bush
18:02:22 <Phearlock> the trees in halo were pretty hardcore
18:02:30 <Phearlock> Idk why the humans just never built their ships out of that

18:21:04 <Cane> Hahah.
18:21:12 <Cane> No, streams are fine for me.
18:21:15 <Cane> Game just ended.
18:21:20 <Phearlock> taht was silly lol
18:21:25 <Halvgud> lost the stream for 30 seconds
18:22:23 <Halvgud> 1st round winner: Mr.camper
18:28:06 <Phearlock> When you start inside the circle and have gear. No reason not to pitch a tent if your pos is good
18:28:29 <Phearlock> Do people find grenades?
18:28:46 <Phearlock> Because those are pretty great at killing things you can't see
18:29:11 <Halvgud> grenades and other items spawn randoml
18:29:20 <Halvgud> One round I found 5 grenades
18:29:33 <Halvgud> Died from bluezoning :\
18:39:16 <Cane> So do you get to pick your suit at the start?
18:39:51 <Halvgud> there's like, 20 different skins/suits
18:40:32 <Halvgud> Nothing apart from the eyecandy about them
18:40:53 <Halvgud> Britain and Germany have country shirts
18:40:56 <Cane> Is there a bright pink one?
18:41:11 <Halvgud> hmmmmno there is a twitch.tv one, does that count?
18:41:46 <Cane> Darn.
18:41:59 <Cane> I feel like in this game, pink would be man mode.
