00:18:46 <motbob> bioshock infinite's still so good
00:19:12 <motbob> also scalia died rip
00:19:30 <motbob> too bad no one here's a lawyer, or in law school, so i can't talk about it
00:20:44 <DoT`> can you explain for someone who doesnt really know 
00:21:01 <DoT`> i see he died and was conservitive from what i gather
00:21:27 <Crisium> now he gets to be replaced by an anti-constitutionalist...
00:21:37 <Crisium> he was really trying to hang on until january to retire
00:21:49 <carcinisation> iirc he was good at trolling?
00:22:27 <motbob> mmm he was influential because he popularized "textualism," which is another way of saying, if the text of a law or the constitutional is unambiguous as to the meaning of the words, that should end the discussion
00:22:57 <DoT`> ah, and the president decides who replaces him?
00:23:21 <DoT`> or at least has a large say
00:23:33 <Crisium> president nominates
00:23:49 <Crisium> congress approves
00:24:00 <DoT`> can anyone else nominate?
00:24:00 -!- Frigo [~Frigo@catv-80-99-5-67.catv.broadband.hu] has joined #tlponies
00:24:10 <Crisium> no
00:24:18 <motbob> which seems uncontroversial but it becomes an interesting issue when you think about things like the 2nd amendment (" the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"), the clear meaning of the twxt is that people can keep guns, but maybe the meaning or purpose behind that amendment doesn't make much sense anymore
00:25:05 <motbob> on one level there is an argument to be made that we should ignore the text and look to intent instead, but textualism says "no" and that's the rule that's basically accepted everywhere now. Because of Scalia.
00:25:34 <motbob> He was also conservative, yeah, and he sort of pioneered the use of dissents for political purposes
00:26:01 <DoT`> is 'textualism' the same as 'originalism'
00:26:03 <motbob> his dissenting opinions are well written and reasoned, so they get published in law school textbooks a lot. Thus influencing a new generation of awyers.
00:26:57 <Crisium> i dont study law of course, but the continued ignoring of the constitution has been an ever increasing trend
00:27:08 <carcinisation> as i understand it this significantly affects balance of supreme court?
00:27:47 <DoT`> So his arguments are used in textbooks for the facts on HOW he argues points, but as its arguments in certain favours it influences new lawyers
00:28:37 <motbob> basically
00:28:50 <motbob> also, his opinions are awesome to read. super entertaining for law students.
00:29:00 <motbob> [18:27:00] <Crisium> i dont study law of course, but the continued ignoring of the constitution has been an ever increasing trend
00:29:15 <motbob> lucky for us, I think
00:30:01 <Crisium> i dont think
00:30:21 <motbob> well you couldn't have child labor laws if you didn't ignore the plain meaning of the constitution
00:30:42 <motbob> or minimum wage laws
00:30:42 <Crisium> sure you could
00:30:47 <Crisium> states
00:30:47 <motbob> explain
00:30:50 <motbob> ya ok
00:31:04 <Crisium> im for small central gov't
00:31:37 <motbob> in practice, states ended up competing with each other for who could have the least restrictive labor laws. It made sense to not have child labor laws because that attracted businesses to your state.
00:31:53 <Crisium> the 10th amendment is shitted on every second of every day
00:32:00 <motbob> The same phenomenon happened with min wage laws, maximum hours, and such
00:32:27 <motbob> if you're not a lower class worker, i guess it's probably better to not have federal labor standards
00:32:36 <motbob> but...
00:33:07 <motbob> wel the tenth amendment doesn't mean anything by its text
00:33:10 <Crisium> Seattle will have over the double federal minimum wage in like a year anyway
00:33:12 <motbob> it's just a truism
00:34:09 <Crisium> i lack the studies to debate with you im afraid
00:34:36 <carcinisation> my question: why not just ammend constitution. there are mechanisms no?
00:34:42 <Crisium> exactly
00:34:55 <DoT`> doesnt that require like 75% approval?
00:35:12 <DoT`> and just gets rejected
00:35:23 <motbob> it's basically impossible to amend the constitution
00:35:27 <Crisium> 2/3 of congress, or 2/3 of states
00:36:09 <Crisium> ah right, 3/4 of states afterwords
00:36:10 <motbob> 2/3rds of congress AND 3/4s of states
00:37:46 <Crisium> thats why i think this is the most important election in many decades
00:37:48 <carcinisation> and i assume amending the process of amending is likewise impossible
00:38:19 <motbob> it probably shouldn't be easier to amend the constitution
00:38:29 <Crisium> its easiest to ignore the consitituion
00:38:34 <Crisium> so both parties do
00:38:44 <motbob> i think that's generally untrue
00:39:21 <Crisium> the size and scope of the federal government is unimaginable to the founders
00:40:00 <motbob> so is the size and scope of the country
00:40:53 <motbob> also, the general structure is basically the same as was envisioned. Congress passes the laws, the Executive sees that they are carried out. It's just that the laws are so complicated that we need a big bureaucracy...
00:42:20 <carcinisation> motbob if it was a matter of size govt would be proportionally the same
00:42:44 <Crisium> the size of the gov't just rises without end
00:42:44 <motbob> is that true? the federal govt has a lot of employees nowadays...
00:43:14 <Crisium> new problems arise, new government attempted solution
00:43:36 <Camail> cris
00:43:38 <Camail> crisssssssss
00:43:41 <Camail> crissssssssssssssssssssssss
00:43:43 <Camail> i need it
00:43:44 <Crisium> preloading now :)
00:43:45 <carcinisation> i would suggest the complication of laws is a major problem, in fact it makes justice impossible when a person cannot know the law
00:43:52 <Camail> its in my computer cris
00:43:56 <Crisium> lol
00:43:57 <Camail> the game is inside my computerrrrrrrrr
00:44:01 <Crisium> tuesday 9am pacific
00:44:13 <Camail> I put it inside and I'm jiggling with antici
00:44:15 <motbob> well that's why we have lawyers like me!
00:44:22 <motbob> i can find out the law, AMA
00:44:32 <Crisium> motbob have you heard "A Time For Choosing" speech before?
00:44:44 <Crisium> its surprisingly relevent for over 50 years old
00:44:59 <Crisium> its not a law speach, just anti-large gov't
00:45:24 <Camail> pation
00:45:31 <carcinisation> iirc certain historic states required a lawkeeper to memorise the entire law. i feel this is a good way of keeping it restrained to a reasonable size
00:45:48 <Camail> thats a waste of cpmuters
00:45:51 <Camail> computers*
00:46:14 <Crisium> whats a waste of computers
00:46:21 <Crisium> ?
00:46:30 <Camail> making 1 person meorize all of law
00:46:38 <Camail> thats why we have computers
00:46:43 <Crisium> oh lol thats impossibl
00:46:51 <Crisium> bills are passed larger than the bible
00:46:59 <Crisium> did anyone even read the TTP
00:47:04 <carcinisation> this was some time before computers cam
00:47:06 <Crisium> like 6 of the senators maybe
00:47:35 <Camail> carcinisation  yea, then you followed up by saying that was a good way of regulating the size of the body of law
00:47:48 <Camail> and I semi-jokingly said that would be a waste fot he possible memory space we have now
00:47:54 <Camail> of the*
00:49:09 <carcinisation> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer
00:49:35 <Crisium> computers are taking our jobs!
00:49:43 <Crisium> herp der der!
00:49:47 <Saurabhinator> :^(
00:49:56 <Saurabhinator> ma jerb
00:49:56 <Camail> human commuter
00:53:33 <motbob> this speech is interesting because it talks about the overhead in social programs and the possibility that maybe it would be better to skip the social program and give direct aid
00:53:42 <motbob> which is basically what the fed govt does nowadays
00:54:11 <motbob> instead of trapping the money behind all kinds of restrictions, they just give it to people via the EITC
00:54:27 <Crisium> glad you're giving it a listen
00:55:05 <motbob> this was the perfect time to give an anti-big-govt speech because it was the high water mark of the pateralistic state
00:55:25 <motbob> paternalistic*

00:56:00 <Crisium> i think if the 2016 election is between, say, sanders and cruz that it'll be a true turning point
00:56:11 <Crisium> radically different ideas
00:56:15 <Crisium> time to choose
00:56:32 <motbob> idk, it's not like a president can really institute any kind of economic policy
00:56:50 <motbob> i wish the sanders lovers would channel that energy into their local congressional election
00:57:11 <Camail> local elections get fucking NO votes
00:57:18 <Camail> ironically its the only time i ever vote
00:57:19 <Crisium> that also part of the problem, people already expect federal gov't to do EVERYTHING
00:57:33 <Crisium> and its a self-fullfilling prophecy
00:57:39 <Camail> but its not
00:58:25 <motbob> the president's important functions are: 1) foreign policy 2) appointment (to the SCOTUS and the bureaucracy) 3) CEO-esque activities 4) being charismatic and inspirational
00:58:26 <Crisium> motbob i think the president can do a lot more than you give credit
00:59:05 <Crisium> appointing judges that legislate thru the bench, as well as his own abilitiy to sign executive orders
00:59:46 <carcinisation> ah i remembered the book i was thinking of
00:59:47 <motbob> the best judges can do is shut down certain attempts by congress to take actions
00:59:54 <carcinisation> The Collapse of Complex Societies by Joseph Tainter
01:00:07 <motbob> the best executive orders can do is to work within frameworks that Congress has already constructed
01:00:19 <carcinisation> very interesting historal review of civilisations
01:00:21 <Crisium> but either way it will take more than a single president to shrink the federal gov't, it would take a transformation of the current expectations of the federal govt
01:00:56 <Crisium> an entire generation would have to not look to washington for solutions
01:01:00 <motbob> well the fed govt shrunk a lot under obama
01:01:13 <motbob> mostly because of military spending but hey
01:01:29 <Crisium> thats open to interpration and you know it lol
01:01:37 <motbob> ok, interpret it the other way
01:01:49 <Crisium> ugh, dont go lawyer on me
01:01:56 <motbob> i'm asking you to make the argument
01:02:01 <motbob> for your position
01:02:02 <Crisium> you cant not be able to acknowledge other view poits without being like that
01:02:30 <motbob> i'm just asking you to explain why you think the federal govt did not shrink a lot under obama
01:02:57 <Crisium> deficit spending is a measurement of the size of government, it has increased to levels now higher than ever, and not by an insignificant amount
01:03:12 <Crisium> the federal gov't spends more now than ever in history
01:03:18 <Crisium> more than in the bush years even
01:03:25 <Crisium> there is no shrinking
01:03:27 <motbob> i think per capita that's untrue
01:03:34 <motbob> and i think per capita is the important metric
01:03:37 <Crisium> what
01:03:49 <Crisium> has the size of the country doubled in 8 years? lol
01:03:58 <motbob> well, let's go dig up the numbers
01:04:10 <carcinisation> where are good stats?
01:05:04 <Crisium> fairly sure obama has roughly doubled the bush years, but someone find the stats :P
01:05:45 <motbob> i will give you $100 if federal outlays under obama have doubled
01:05:48 <motbob> gl
01:07:13 <Camail> http://www.theonion.com/graphic/justice-scalia-dead-following-30-year-battle-socia-52356
01:07:20 <Crisium> looks pretty close to double http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_debt_chart.html
01:08:09 <motbob> this is debt, which isn't the same thing as "outlays" or "spending"
01:09:57 <Crisium> you dont view that as an indicator of the government "not shrinking"
01:10:44 <motbob> well a lot, a LOT, of this figure has nothing to do with the size of the govt. A lot has to do with 1) military spending (wars), 2) medicare (especially Part D)
01:11:30 <carcinisation> 2009 United States federal budget ¬ñ $3.1 trillion (submitted 2008 by President Bush)
01:11:35 <carcinisation> 2016 United States federal budget ¬ñ $4.0 trillion (submitted 2015 by President Obama)
01:11:40 <carcinisation> from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget
01:11:52 <Crisium> youd have to add all yaers
01:12:33 <motbob> you could pass a law that increased the deficit by $1t without affecting what the government's functions are hardly at all. Actually that's kind of what medicare part D did
01:12:35 <carcinisation> inflation accounts for about half they rise if i calc right
01:12:50 <Camail> inflation since the end of each respective presidents terms is around ~10%
01:12:53 <Camail> according to google
01:13:03 <Crisium> the peak of the "war spending" was definitely not in the latter obama years
01:13:46 <motbob> well with inflation and per capita considerations it's pretty obvious that govt spending hasn't increased much under obama
01:13:49 <motbob> if at all
01:13:50 <Crisium> motbob, if the government didnt have so many programs and bureaucracies it would not spend such as this
01:14:03 <Crisium> its not shrinking
01:14:04 <motbob> you can thank the republican congress for that of course
01:14:23 <Crisium> such defensive, brand centric justifications
01:14:33 <motbob> ok, cut a program/bureacracy. go.
01:14:51 <motbob> let's talk about what you're cutting and how much it costs and what it does.
01:14:51 <Crisium> all foreign aid
01:14:58 <Crisium> nasa
01:15:10 <DoT`> cut nasa D:
01:15:11 <motbob> ok, pakistan central govt collapses and now extremists in that country have nukes.
01:15:18 <motbob> what else will you cut?
01:15:26 <Camail> lmao nasa
01:15:41 <Crisium> have you seen the private space companies trying to take off?
01:15:42 <DoT`> they are so small already
01:15:54 <Crisium> oh they are, but every bit counts
01:16:09 <Camail> do you know why?
01:16:10 <motbob> ok, you cut nasa, congrats the fed govt budget is now 0.4% less
01:16:14 <motbob> what else will you cut?
01:16:44 <Camail> kill everyone above the age of 56
01:16:46 <Camail> ez
01:16:52 <motbob> camail i think that's a fantastic idea
01:16:53 <Camail> use bodies as alternative fuel
01:17:04 <motbob> it would definitely solve a lot of problems
01:17:11 <Camail> create jobs for corpse shovelers
01:17:18 <motbob> however, i think we should raise the age a bit and add an exception for people who are still employed
01:17:24 <Crisium> motbob im not running for office
01:17:26 <Crisium> lol
01:17:32 <DoT`> bonecarvers will get a boon of cheap supplies
01:17:46 <motbob> it is true that you are not running for office
01:18:10 <Camail> #handwaving
01:18:16 <motbob> but i don't really understand how that affects your inability to think of a way to shrink the fed govt significantly even though you are so sure it will happen
01:18:17 <carcinisation> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIlJwW4311Q
01:18:17 <Crisium> i dont have a list of the superfluous spending in front of me, nor memorized
01:18:29 <Phearlock> As much as I like it, cut the entire A-10 fleet already.
01:18:38 <Phearlock> It's past its due date for cost effective usefulness
01:18:47 <motbob> i mean just go co-opt a pundit's opinions, it's not that hard
01:19:08 <motbob> why not say "eliminate the EITC"
01:19:15 <motbob> that's a pretty big part of spending
01:19:21 <motbob> why not say "raise ss age to 75"
01:19:31 <motbob> and the medicare age
01:19:43 <motbob> that's where the real money is
01:19:44 <Camail> libertarians haven't been relevant since like 1950
01:19:48 <Crisium> actually i liked chritie's idea on ss even if i didnt like the man
01:20:08 <motbob> what was his idea?
01:21:01 <carcinisation> cam it starts by asking the audience if they want to hear the depressing version of the talk or the really depressing one :p
01:21:06 <Crisium> i think it was his, but basically remove the cap on % ppl pay into the program (i believe you stop paying after making more than 100-200K or so)
01:21:28 <Crisium> and if you have good income already when you retire, you forfeit your SS payments because you dont need them
01:21:39 <Crisium> not sure at what level, but it was upper class only
01:21:55 <carcinisation> it covers how public opinion favours things like smaller govt, 1st ammd until you get to actual examples
01:22:04 <motbob> that's interesting but the way ss works currently, it's basically just an extra tax on the rich. you could do that seperately without tying it to ss specifically
01:22:08 <carcinisation> then they want to keep everthing
01:22:17 <carcinisation> well except foreign aid
01:22:21 <motbob> ss isn't a fund where the money is locked away
01:22:30 <Camail> doesnt that increase gov't  influence by taking in more money isntead of cutting policy
01:22:36 <carcinisation> cause ppl don't realise it's more about buying policy than helping ppl
01:23:19 <carcinisation> ss is a ponzi scheme that works because of the lenght of generations
01:23:34 <motbob> i think we need as many taxes on the very rich as possible so i fully support christie's proposal
01:23:45 <Crisium> what i mean is, someone who makes $1 million a  year only pays SS tax on the first 100K or so, and when they retire they collect payments, with this solution they pay the SS tax on their whole paycheck and they collect NOTHING
01:23:58 <carcinisation> it's gonna fail but no-one wants to be the one to deal with that so it's gonna get kicked down the road
01:24:02 <Crisium> i have no mercy for the super rich
01:24:03 <Crisium> lol
01:24:20 <Camail> i think everyone understands the concept
01:24:25 <motbob> ya, that's just a tax on the rich though right? they lose out on money because they are rich. they have to spend more because they are rich.
01:24:39 <carcinisation> i'm afraid they may not all have too much mercy for you cris :p
01:24:46 <Crisium> its actually a regressive tax now
01:24:54 <Crisium> this would make it flat
01:25:22 <motbob> ss's regressive? i think some ss payments are treated as gross income above a certain amount, so you might be wrong. not sure though
01:25:33 <carcinisation> g'night #tlpolitics
01:25:35 <Crisium> you stop paying the SS tax at 100 some K
01:25:37 <motbob> and the rest of the tax system obvoously makes up for it
01:25:38 <Camail> nn
01:25:39 <Crisium> i forget the exact amount
01:25:52 <Crisium> thats regressive, because the rich pay less % of their income to SS
01:26:06 <DoT`> gnight reif
01:26:13 <Crisium> nn reif
01:26:27 <motbob> well they get less back as well, so the benefit system is "progressive"
01:26:32 <Camail> the US government should declare google as committing treason and take over alphabet inc.
01:26:52 <motbob> you can't really look at social security in the same lens as normal taxes
01:26:55 <Crisium> ya, but the less they get back should be 0 once they are rich enough :P
01:27:33 <motbob> i mean I agree with your general sentiment but I would prefer to just levy a 50% tax on income above $10m instead of changing ss
01:27:39 <DoT`> duuub
01:27:40 <Rawr|Phone> Dub dub dub
01:27:44 <DuB`> Whew!
01:27:53 <motbob> and hike the death tax
01:28:04 <skram> hallo mr. dub
01:28:20 <motbob> OR just lower income tax substantially and institute a wealth tax (that won't ever happen though)
01:28:43 <Crisium> i do take issue with conservatives who do not want a progressive tax
01:28:43 <Camail> mot i dont think the word 'wealth' and 'tax' can be that close in a legal document
01:28:51 <Camail> like magnets
01:28:53 <Crisium> bernie's tax plan is fine for me actually
01:29:04 <motbob> the death tax should be 75% above $4.3m honestly
01:29:09 <Crisium> i dont want bernies other ideas though, except single payer maybe
01:29:52 <DoT`> dub, neeb wrecking http://www.twitch.tv/basetradetv
01:30:00 <DuB`> I like neeb wrecking!
01:30:03 <Crisium> *his income tax plan only, not his corporate tax
01:30:08 <DoT`> http://www.twitch.tv/nathanias
01:30:09 <DoT`> huk
01:30:14 <motbob> what's his corporate tax plan
01:32:12 <motbob> "The business tax code is rigged against small businesses, making it harder for them to compete." I don't think this is true
01:32:46 <Crisium> im trying to find figures, but its so hard to sort through the opinion articles
01:33:29 <Crisium> but his income tax plan is fair i think
01:34:33 <Crisium> oh good, he also want to remove the  $118,500 SS tax cap
01:34:43 <motbob> liberals always bring up the high marginal tax rates under eisenhower but things were quite a bit different then
01:34:48 <motbob> in terms of deductions
01:36:08 <motbob> he wants to raise capital gains taxes, but idk. The economics major in me thinks that the capital gains tax should be 0%
01:36:59 <motbob> "Double the capital gains tax for the wealthiest 2%" LOL that's kind of freaky
01:37:10 <Crisium> he also didn't outline lowering the corporate tax rate, since i think ideally youd would both attempt to eliminate the "loopholes" people spiel about but also lower the rate
01:37:11 <motbob> i've never heard of a progressive tax system on capital
01:39:10 <Crisium> he wants to eliminate the loopholes but it appears he wants to keep the 39% top rate, but that cantbe competetive in a global economy
01:39:50 <Crisium> no one is perfect i guess
01:40:09 <Crisium> i like that cruz is the closest we have to a small govt constitutionalist, but flat tax? are you real?
01:40:14 <motbob> well, i don't really have an opinion on any of that stuff. tax issues are pretty tricky. i think anything short of a wealth tax is unlikely to solve the problem of wealth accumulation
01:40:14 <Crisium> flat tax
01:40:17 <Crisium> why
01:40:42 <motbob> flat tax l o l
01:41:03 <Crisium> but again, no one is perfect, so id hope congress would "lol" him and then we can move on to other issues
01:41:19 <Crisium> bible thumping and flat tax is the bane of the republicans for me
01:41:27 <Crisium> makes us look so dumb
01:41:35 <motbob> well i think it's pretty predictable waht will happen with a republican congress and republican president
01:41:48 <motbob> all the ideals of small govt will go out the window
01:41:55 <motbob> we'll have big govt AND low taxes
01:42:05 <Crisium> aka bush years
01:42:13 <motbob> pretty much
01:42:40 <Crisium> yeah its lose lose all around, but besides cruz' folly on the flat tax he does not stand for a large govt
01:42:45 <Camail> those were fun years
01:43:07 <motbob> they were. thank you bush for making 2006 daily show + colbert report so great
01:44:23 <Crisium> but its alarming that debt has only gone up, i think a conserative vs a neo con which bush was would be more ideal than "4 more years" hillary
01:45:04 <Camail> thats what debt does now
01:45:47 <motbob> debt's been pretty steady after we got out of iraq (mostly) and realized what a money sink medicare part d was
01:46:07 <motbob> the magic happens when congress and the president are not in the same party
01:46:11 <Crisium> that it hasnt decreases since we left iraq is worrisome
01:46:31 <Crisium> something filled that hole
01:46:47 <Crisium> Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton
01:46:51 <Crisium> balance in the force
01:50:09 <motbob> it is shrinking in real dollars per capita :D
01:50:18 <Crisium> but as it stands no one can deny that cruz has crusaded against gov't spending, so outside of his tax plan no one else seems serious to combat it
01:50:46 <Crisium> well ill take any good news then
01:50:52 <Crisium> still needs to lower as % of GDP
01:50:59 <motbob> govt budget cuts are a real hassle because I have to deal with the IRS and basically all of their budget cuts went towards customer service
01:51:48 <motbob> http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/include/usgs_chartSp02t.png that shrunk too
01:52:09 <motbob> gdp is fueled by population so it stands to reason
01:52:32 <motbob> also we had a big recession so maybe this metric is meaningless
01:52:37 <Crisium> well, whatever the hell this is: http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/include/usgs_chartDp12f.png
01:53:11 <motbob> that's just saying we've been running deficits
01:53:29 <motbob> which could be fixed by raising taxes or shrinking the govt
01:54:22 <Crisium> a tax hike alone cant do it
01:54:34 <motbob> mmm
01:54:45 <motbob> i think that's technically untrue
01:55:05 <Crisium> is there enough wealth?
01:55:22 <motbob> oh absolutely
01:55:32 <motbob> i mean
01:55:54 <motbob> at one point you have to strike a balance between hiking taxes and keeping the wealthy in your country
01:56:02 <Crisium> tax hike alone cant turn a surplus based on current spending trends
01:56:23 <Camail> if you take everyones money, sure
01:57:25 <Crisium> thats what i mean lol, even if you did a 90% tax rate on $1 million+ and they some didnt move to another country, would that be enough to eraise 19 trillion
01:57:41 <motbob> not in one year probably
01:58:10 <motbob> BUT if we had a big enough wealth tax, maybe it could happen!
01:58:33 <Crisium> i dont think so
01:59:25 <motbob> why? it's just simple math. at some point there is x for total USA wealth * x = national debt
01:59:43 <motbob> it's not a question of "is this conceptually possible"
02:00:15 <Crisium> theres not enough wealth
02:00:22 <Crisium> good point, theres no conception
02:00:59 <motbob> what do you mean there's not enough wealth
02:01:07 <Camail> cris no one is trying to erase the debt in its entirety today
02:01:26 <motbob> i'm not saying that having a one-time 35% wealth tax would be wise
02:01:38 <DoT`> dub http://www.twitch.tv/nathanias
02:01:46 <Crisium> if you take 100% of all money from $1 million+ earners, we would still run a deficit
02:01:53 <Crisium> not all money, i mean 100% tax
02:01:56 <Camail> until a point
02:02:09 <motbob> you're taxing income instead of capital
02:02:14 <Camail> you'd be decreasing the debt, that's for sure
02:02:21 <motbob> wait
02:02:26 <motbob> [20:01:49] <Crisium> if you take 100% of all money from $1 million+ earners, we would still run a deficit
02:02:43 <motbob> can you explain the difference between deficit and debt just so I know were on the same page
02:03:05 <Crisium> deficit is spending more than you take in, that year
02:03:28 <Crisium> debt is cumulative deficit
02:03:36 <Saurabhinator> woah buddy
02:03:41 <Saurabhinator> whats going on in here
02:03:43 <DuB`> Neeb v polt. :O
02:03:59 <DuB`> We politics tonight!
02:04:00 <CockRoach|42> a civil discussion about politics :o
02:04:00 <motbob> so what would the income be from taking the full income from all $1m or more peeps
02:04:22 <Saurabhinator> it sounds more like economics
02:04:40 <Crisium> this is several years old, http://www.forbes.com/sites/danbigman/2012/04/03/john-stossel-tax-the-rich-the-rich-dont-have-enough-really/#6520d2f7772c
02:04:55 <motbob> actually I think you might be correct in what you're saying. i don't know one way or another because i don't have the numbers. But
02:04:57 <Crisium> "If the IRS grabbed 100 percent of income over $1 million, the take would be just $616 billion. That‚Äôs only a third of this year‚Äôs deficit."
02:05:14 <Saurabhinator> „ÉΩ‡ºº ‚Ä¢ Õú ‚Ä¢‡ºΩÔæâ
02:05:18 <Crisium> spending must be reined in, in addition to taxing wealthy
02:05:22 <motbob> dude
02:05:23 <motbob> that means
02:05:33 <motbob> that we would no longer be running a deficit
02:05:42 <motbob> because the deficit is pretty small right now
02:05:45 <Crisium> if we spend 4 trillion a year
02:05:45 <motbob> wait
02:05:49 <motbob> never mind i fucked up
02:05:56 <motbob> ANYWAY the point I was going to make was
02:06:19 <motbob> above a certain wealth level, you have to worry about taxing capital rather than income
02:06:21 <Camail> "The US government's budget deficit fell to an eight-year low in fiscal 2015, dropping to $439 billion, the Treasury Department announced Thursday." from google
02:06:29 <Camail> http://news.yahoo.com/us-budget-deficit-falls-8-low-2015-194021330.html
02:06:33 <Camail> literally just read the top line
02:06:41 <Camail> so it could mean something else but yea
02:07:17 <Crisium> oh your right
02:07:28 <Camail> but i mean
02:07:29 <Crisium> either way you need both tho
02:07:38 <Camail> does it really matter if you COULD take everyones money
02:07:42 <Camail> thats never gonna work
02:07:46 <Camail> so its purely academic
02:08:00 <Crisium> or technically shrinking the govt alone could solve it if you are... thorough enough, without a tax hike
02:08:08 <Crisium> but ideally id like both
02:08:09 <Camail> just explode the goverment
02:08:10 <Crisium> anyway i gtg
02:08:12 <Crisium> ggs

05:19:09 <Crisium> oh wait no
05:19:13 <Crisium> iv hit the windows key
05:19:16 <Crisium> thats the worst
05:19:23 <Crisium> when windows key minimizes the game
05:20:04 <motbob> no i mean
05:20:20 <motbob> the purpose of it would be to keep people from alt-tabbing to look at solutions
05:20:31 <Crisium> ah
05:20:40 <Crisium> well, grandma

05:25:59 <Crisium> well i didnt get one til late 2013

05:26:38 <Crisium> late comers unite
05:26:50 <Crisium> motbob we are at a pivotal time in history
05:26:57 <Crisium> choices must be made to determine the course
05:27:00 <Crisium> will you choose
05:27:04 <Crisium> apple? or google?
05:27:12 <motbob> whatever's cheapest
05:27:16 <Crisium> google then
05:27:18 <motbob> so probably google i imagine
05:27:43 <motbob> actually if i get a fancy lawyer job it's whatever my firm expects me to buy
05:28:43 <motbob> image is important and I'll already be not living up to the lawyer image because I'll have a relatively cheap car
05:29:04 <motbob> and cheap suits. and a cheap apartment but hopefully people won't see that
05:29:33 <motbob> i hate expensive stuff except to the extent that it buys time for me to do stuf on t h e  i n t e r n e t
05:29:38 <Crisium> have you ever talked to catties, he is in the law business
05:29:51 <motbob> he's in that business but he's not a lawyer
05:29:55 <Crisium> true
05:29:59 <motbob> he's really in the computer science business
05:32:49 <Crisium> i think the technology age is good for low standards of living personally
05:32:56 <Crisium> cars are more reliable than ever
05:33:02 <Crisium> electricity is cheap
05:33:22 <Crisium> computers stagnate thanks to the end of moors law
05:33:31 <Crisium> you dont need to be rich to have a good life
05:33:40 <Crisium> but as a lawyer you will be :P
05:36:05 <motbob> cars are more reliable but they're also a bit expensive historically
05:36:28 <motbob> from the data i'm looking at, they're more expensive than they've been since at least 1990
05:37:18 <Crisium> hmm thats unfortunate
05:37:26 <Crisium> but the reliability is a joke
05:37:49 <Crisium> half a century ago weekly maintaince was the norm
05:38:03 <Crisium> now for at least the first 5+ years you just need periodic work once a year
05:39:09 <Crisium> i know crap about cards but mine is 3 years old and has only had oil changes
05:39:24 <Crisium> tires fine, filter fine, radiator fluit fine
05:39:29 <Crisium> its EZ mode
05:40:50 <Crisium> lol i havent even added an ounce of windshielf wiper fluid in 3 years
05:40:53 <Crisium> nada
05:41:01 <Crisium> and i have a compact car
05:41:15 <Crisium> im so happy cars are EZ
05:41:25 <motbob> electricity prices have been remarkably steady over the past 50 years
05:41:44 <motbob> which is WEIRD considering oil prices
05:41:44 <Crisium> america has it great on electricity
05:42:45 <Crisium> and why is gas like $1.90
05:42:48 <Crisium> what year is it
05:43:35 <Crisium> i could live on minimum wage if i had to
05:43:38 <Crisium> i swear to god
05:43:41 <motbob> rly
05:43:48 <motbob> if you paid off your car maybe
05:43:57 <motbob> lol DO U KNOW HOW LITTLE MIN WAGE I
05:44:07 <motbob> what's your rent dude damn
05:44:07 <Crisium> i could live off $1200 a month
05:44:15 <Crisium> cheap studio
05:44:23 <Crisium> gas only for work and shopping
05:44:34 <Crisium> family is different of course
05:44:37 <Crisium> but im single
05:44:43 <motbob> i think you probably need a roommate to do min wage
05:44:58 <Crisium> studios are $500 month where i live
05:45:05 <motbob> ooo that's pretty good
05:45:09 <motbob> where do you live
05:45:17 <Crisium> pittsburgh
05:45:59 <Crisium> we win most livable city award every other year or so
05:46:55 <motbob> i guess if I was very disciplined about eating in, I could do it
05:47:00 <motbob> but, I am not
05:47:57 <Crisium> ya, food is a huge variable
05:48:07 <Crisium> it takes discipline to keep food costs low
05:48:36 <Crisium> and it sucks that proccessed 90% carb food is the cheapest
05:48:46 <motbob> rice and beans
05:48:49 <Crisium> so if you want to live off scraps you gotta be unhealthy
05:48:50 <motbob> bread and peanut butter
05:48:54 <Camail> rice is so fucking cheap
05:48:57 <motbob> bananas
05:49:12 <motbob> oatmeal
05:49:22 <Crisium> oatmeal is good
05:49:34 <motbob> bananas in the oatmeal
05:49:40 <Crisium> yeah theres healthy food to be found for cheapish, just gotta have the willlpower
05:50:00 <Camail> simple foods that are available in bulk
05:50:06 <Camail> also home mini gardens
05:51:08 <Crisium> my plan for poverty is to alternate free breakfasts at hotels
05:51:19 <Crisium> they wont  catch on if you alternate with a lot of the
05:51:51 <motbob> yes
05:52:03 <Camail> I can eat rice until i die and be happy, so I'd probably be set
05:52:20 <Camail> rice and potatos can sustain me
05:52:25 <Crisium> rice is the main food of an entire continent
05:52:30 <Crisium> good strart
05:53:04 <motbob> as long as you did all the growin' that you're going to do in your life, potatos + rice is fine
05:53:33 <motbob> this is making me hungry
05:53:41 <Camail> yup
05:53:47 <motbob> actually it's making me want to eat out and NOT eat rice and beans
05:53:53 <Camail> really want some corned beef and mashed potatoes right now
05:54:11 <motbob> o damn i ate lunch 8 hours ago, no wonder

05:56:16 <Camail> i fucking hate waking up cold
05:56:20 <Crisium> skram works an odd shift though i know
05:56:22 <Crisium> so i forgive you
05:56:24 <Camail> worst feeling
05:56:30 <Camail> i dont forgive him
05:56:33 <Camail> he needs to earn it
05:56:35 <Crisium> i need the cold to sleep tbh
05:56:45 <motbob> yes
05:56:50 <Crisium> if im hot i just cant sleep at all
05:56:52 <Camail> no like, waking up with chills
05:56:57 <motbob> i bought a comforter and sometimes i wake up because it's too hot
05:57:00 <Camail> I like snuggling up in blankets
05:57:05 <motbob> i think it was still worth it though
05:57:34 <motbob> im so hungry but it's midnight, everything's closed probably
05:57:53 <Camail> hmmm
05:57:58 <motbob> i will go to mcdonalds.
05:58:00 <Camail> gas station food IS a thing
05:58:04 <Camail> that too
05:58:07 <Camail> tho not sure which one is worse
05:58:10 <motbob> gas station food
05:58:18 <motbob> oh, like hot dogs
05:58:27 <Camail> ew not the hot dogs
05:58:32 <motbob> well what then
05:58:33 <Camail> everything else 
05:58:38 <Camail> snacks?
05:58:45 <Camail> its so late you shouldnt ahve a full meal
05:58:47 <motbob> oh, vending machine style stuff
05:58:49 <Camail> ya
05:58:56 <motbob> i skipped dinner what do you want me to do
05:59:00 <motbob> ok peace
05:59:03 <Camail> lol, cya
05:59:16 <Crisium> yes Camail, i go to gastation for mindight and AM runs
05:59:30 <Crisium> they make on the order warm food
05:59:32 <Crisium> its not bad
05:59:52 <Camail> i always try and eat light at night now
06:00:00 <Crisium> get a good toasted sandwich at a gas station
06:00:10 <Camail> i fail sometimes, but its important
06:00:23 <Camail> cuz a full meal before bed is fuckin useless for your body
06:00:36 <Crisium> gotta get the fat for winter
06:00:46 <skram> like a bear
06:00:48 <Crisium> forget new years resolutions
06:00:54 <Crisium> eating right is an April resolution
06:00:58 <motbob> [00:00:26] <+Camail> cuz a full meal before bed is fuckin useless for your body
06:01:04 <motbob> useless in what way
06:01:14 <Camail> your metabolism is much lower when you sleep
06:01:25 <Camail> so its all jsut getting stored up
06:01:37 <motbob> oh that's pretty fantastic for someone like me
06:01:38 <Camail> thats why breakfast should ideally be the most substantial meal
06:02:04 <Crisium> bacon and eggs dear
06:02:11 <Crisium> OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
06:02:17 <Crisium> I SAID BACON AND EGGS
06:02:33 <motbob> now that's not something you can eat on a budget
06:02:36 <motbob> actually
06:02:42 <motbob> i think i will go to dennys
06:03:09 <Camail> now THATS a classic midnight place
06:03:12 <motbob> OH MY GOD THERE IS A NEW DENNYS OPENING

06:09:44 <Camail> (he cant see parenthetical text)
06:09:45 <Crisium> as earily as april
06:09:57 <DuB`> I AM pretty swamped in getting into my uni major program this semester...
06:09:58 <skram> gotta get to sleep before sunrise
06:10:00 <Crisium> glhf skram, sleep is the hard life
06:10:01 <skram> the light burns us
06:10:03 <DuB`> And working.
06:10:08 <DuB`> 5 is a lot of hours.
06:10:11 <DuB`> Even more than 4.
06:10:21 <Crisium> ok
06:10:23 <Crisium> 4.25
06:10:27 <Crisium> thats all i ask
06:10:32 <Camail> (ask him for nudes)
06:10:35 <Crisium> think of the children
06:10:48 <DuB`> I DID also go 2-23 on the day I played in the beta.
06:10:50 <DuB`> Was rough.
06:10:50 <Crisium> they want you to turn away from a life of drugs and crime
06:10:57 <Crisium> and embrace a life of fighting streets
06:10:59 <Camail> wow dub u suck
06:11:03 <Camail> i tohught i trained you better than that
06:11:04 <DuB`> Srs.
06:11:05 <Crisium> dub plz
06:11:12 <DuB`> SRS.
06:11:13 <Crisium> flowchart ken can win 33% of matches
06:11:17 <Crisium> FO REAL
06:11:19 <Camail> ummm
06:11:23 <Camail> flowchart chun you mean
06:11:26 <DuB`> Well I wasn't playing ken!
06:11:26 <Camail> s.hp until they leave
06:11:28 <DuB`> Or chun!
06:11:46 <Camail> i told you to, half way through
06:11:53 <DuB`> That was NOT half way.
06:11:57 <DuB`> I had played 20 by then.
06:12:03 <Crisium> third strike chun can win 50% of matches by pressing 1 button
06:12:08 <Crisium> no joke
06:12:18 <Camail> if you can hit confirm into super, yea
06:12:27 <Crisium> FP, or b.fp
06:12:28 <Camail> also most amtch ups in 3s didnt matter
06:12:29 <Crisium> your choice
06:12:40 <Camail> b.fp is fucking amaizng in this game
06:12:42 <Camail> its safe
06:12:44 <Camail> and crush counters
06:12:49 <Camail> is an anti air
06:13:10 <Camail> and a whiff punish into a combo
06:13:12 <Crisium> Camail even if you embrace a heathen god like mika, i hope you keep chun a steady pocket whore
06:13:14 <Camail> and a screen carry
06:13:19 <Crisium> chun is fun to fight as vega
06:13:24 <Crisium> the battle of normals
06:13:33 <Camail> chun is #1 right now imo
06:13:38 <Camail> from a pure normals perspective
06:13:51 <Crisium> in 3 days Camail we will fight
06:13:55 <Crisium> prepare your body
06:14:05 <Camail> middle of the week i have 0 clue what I'll be doing
06:14:12 <Camail> wish it came out friday
06:14:20 <Crisium> just press buttons that are + on block
06:14:27 <Crisium> thats all that matters on day 0
06:14:32 <Camail> no, i mean i dont know if I'll ahve time
06:14:37 <Crisium> :O
06:14:43 <Crisium> i will give you time
06:14:51 <Camail> I already have an idea of how to play her, watched a ton of jwong and played the last beta only with her
06:15:11 <Camail> i just listed all the things b.fp could do
06:15:18 <Camail> als s.lk anti air? best
06:15:20 <Camail> BEST
06:15:35 <Camail> its basically a knockdown
06:15:43 <Crisium> chun li is a well designed character
06:15:56 <Crisium> good normals, can only invincibility with meter
06:16:17 <Camail> her damage the BEST and her v skill is not PERECT, thats about th eonly thin stopping her from being SS-tier
06:16:23 <Camail> damage isn't*
06:16:44 <Crisium> Birdie will be top tier first few weeks i think
06:16:53 <Crisium> then Karin
06:16:56 <Camail> anyone with full screen moves
06:16:57 <Crisium> this is the era of Karin
06:17:00 <Camail> aka cammy and bridie
06:17:19 <Crisium> Birdie is legit for week 1
06:17:37 <Camail> he's good regardless
06:18:36 <Camail> but yea
06:18:50 <Camail> gah, zangief is so fucking strong
06:18:55 <Crisium> i dunno
06:19:00 <Crisium> he seems balanced
06:19:09 <Camail> v skill that deals with long slow pokes
06:19:22 <Camail> v trigger that threatens vacuum for 22 seconds
06:19:31 <Crisium> i think Birdie, Bison, Mika, Karin are the best
06:20:33 <Crisium> + frames is key to SFV imo
06:20:43 <Crisium> and bison and mika just are out of control
06:21:02 <Crisium> birdie is a zoner who can do serious damage, and karin is karin
06:21:04 <Crisium> thus top 4
06:21:06 <Camail> chun, karin, zangief are the ones I KNOW are crazy good, havent had enough time with the others
06:21:14 <Camail> fang is crazy
06:21:17 <Camail> have you seen his stuff
06:21:24 <Crisium> hes a wildcard
06:21:26 <Camail> his multi hit moves counter hit on all hits
06:21:48 <Crisium> im just not sure about the poisen
06:21:56 <Crisium> poison*
06:22:46 <Camail> it does decent damage
06:23:01 <Camail> its most potent when his zoning apttern is set up
06:23:20 <Camail> his v reversal is a side switch telport
06:23:25 <Camail> which is HUGE
06:23:42 <Camail> and his v trigger isnt even good
06:23:48 <Camail> so he can be using v reversal all day
