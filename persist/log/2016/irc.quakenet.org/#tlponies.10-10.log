21:19:29 <Camail> i have the adblock socket extension as well as adblock, so i dont see an ad even when i turn adblock off
21:19:37 <Camail> so i can kinda just...get bits forever?
21:20:04 <Camail> 10 per minute, haven't hit a cap yet at 25 bits
21:21:25 <Camail> theoretically i can get 6 USD an hour, which is almost minimum wage, especially after tax
21:22:20 <Camail> nvm this is boring and they put questionarres in the middle of the ads so it wouldnt be easy to automate
21:23:32 <Dot`> well, almost free money
21:23:45 <Camail> i'd be interested in seeing if kids do this
21:23:52 <Camail> some old free to paly games i played did something similar
21:23:57 <Camail> but their deals were WAY more shady
21:24:13 <Camail> like signing up for services with a credit card
21:24:33 <Camail> even back then i knew that was not smart
21:25:48 <Camail> but this looks way cleaner, its prominent in the chat menu, and relatively easy to do. I would almost say that a program like this makes me not hate bits
21:26:23 <Camail> if this kind of thing became the primary focus of bits with the very undesirable but possible option of just buying bits, I'm cool with that...kinda
21:26:32 <Camail> good job twitch
21:32:42 <Dot`> i havnt seen it but i do have ad block on
