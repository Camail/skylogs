03:09:52 <ZK> .i like herring
03:09:54 <ZK> its like a trout
03:09:57 <Camail> #Boruto4ever
03:10:07 <ZK> .u boruto
03:10:17 <ZK> oh
03:10:37 <Camail> thats just wrong
03:10:42 <Camail> its literally their son
03:10:45 <Camail> and its not a 'term'
03:10:48 <Camail> its just his name
03:11:09 <ZK> naruto has a son :o
03:11:16 <Camail> thats why urban dictionary sucks
03:11:32 <Camail> yea the naruto manga ended
03:11:42 <Camail> and they did a second timewarp
03:11:44 <ZK> oh, so aftermath?
03:12:05 <Camail> yea, i don't know any actual details
03:12:20 <Camail> i think they're is an anime as well?
03:12:23 <motbob> there was a movie set years in the future featuring boruto
03:12:26 <motbob> is
03:12:41 <Camail> all I know is that sasuke and pink hair girl have a daughter named Salad
03:13:05 <ZK> wait, timewarp to continue writing more, or an aftermath ?
03:13:13 <Camail> what do you mean aftermath
03:13:21 <ZK> where they just say harry married giny and had 3 kids
03:13:26 <ZK> and nothing more
03:13:28 <Camail> no not that
03:13:32 <Camail> its a spin off series
03:13:35 <ZK> oh kk
03:13:39 <ZK> whats that type of thing called again?
03:13:42 <ZK> I'm trying to find it
03:13:48 <motbob> anyway, years in the future, this happens https://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/19439/animated-arifumi_imai-boruto-_naruto_the_movie-cre
03:13:55 <Camail> ova?
03:14:23 <ZK> hm no, i was thinking epitath, really not that
03:14:30 <ZK> epilogue!
03:14:31 <ZK> there we go
03:14:40 <motbob> "harry potter end chapter thing"
03:14:46 <ZK> is an epilogue
03:14:49 <Camail> is that in the boruto movie?
03:15:09 <motbob> probably
03:15:32 <Camail> yea he looks like an adult
03:15:34 <ZK> is the naruto manga worth reading?
03:15:48 <Camail> no
03:15:50 <motbob> yes
03:15:54 <motbob> to a point
03:15:59 <motbob> just read until you get bored
03:16:31 <ZK> thats what ive been doing with the xmen comics, but then it gets boring, but then it gets really good later on
03:16:42 <motbob> i don't think naruto is like that
03:16:47 <ZK> oh kk
03:16:48 <Camail> read until sasuke goes full emo, then the next 98% follows the same patterns, then the last 2% is the ending
03:17:05 <motbob> read until the timeskip
03:17:19 <motbob> at least
03:17:20 <Camail> The fact that rock lee gets so downplayed makes my heart weep
03:17:29 <ZK> is the timeskip the shippuden thing?
03:17:34 <motbob> idk
03:17:41 <Camail> I read his wikipage and I'm like...maaaan
03:17:48 <Camail> just slap a tialed beast in him idc
03:17:51 <Camail> he could handle it
03:17:57 <Camail> tailed*
03:18:36 <ZK> oh yep, its shippuden that the after 2 year timeskip
03:18:46 <Camail> zk you should read bleach
03:18:52 <ZK> oh ok
03:18:59 <Camail> You'll know exactly when to quit
03:19:04 <Camail> its a very easy decision
03:19:08 <ZK> is that before you start?
03:19:33 <Camail> no, its good for a time
03:19:42 <ZK> ok, so something relaly stupid happens
03:20:05 <motbob> there aren't many manga which stay good until the end
03:20:10 <motbob> there's like... 2
03:20:47 <Camail> especially manga that long
03:21:09 <Camail> I've heard good things about pun pun....well...'good'
03:21:41 <motbob> punpun is very good for a long time, but it doesn't wrap things up well at all
03:21:56 <motbob> 20th Century Boys drops off very hard
03:22:06 <Camail> endings are ahrd
03:22:10 <motbob> i'll tell you what doesn't, though: FMA
03:22:55 <Camail> I need to watch the rest of brotherhood eventually
03:23:26 <Camail> I kinda stopped watching serial anime because it wasnt worth the effort of finding out what I liked
03:23:45 <Camail> jesus is aizen still alive
03:23:48 <Camail> bleach pls
03:24:34 <motbob> Boku dake ga Inai Machi is a show that everyone's freaking out about, and I wasn't going to watch it right away, but now I found out that the show is ending at about the same time as the manga
03:25:13 <Camail> yay no filler
03:25:16 <Camail> or minimal
03:34:23 <ZK> is one piece good?
03:35:01 <ZK> also, long serial that stays good, thats dragon ball i guess?
03:36:46 <motbob> the intro to dragon ball is pretty good. I stopped reading it fairly quickly though. The author sort of flailed about for a while before getting to the Z saga.
03:37:21 <motbob> They are doing rereleases of Dragon Ball, with nice-looking ful color pages and stuff, and those are slowly getting released and translated
03:37:28 <ZK> oooh nice
03:37:37 <motbob> I am just waiting for those to be done before I skip to the Z saga and finish it
03:37:51 <ZK> going to space sort of opened stuff up i guess? I just watched the anime when it was on tv
03:38:46 <motbob> idk. It may be that all of it after a certain point is bad, and that I only like the Z Saga stuff because of nostalgia
03:39:10 <motbob> i think that's probably not true though, since reading the beginning made me think that the author is a genius
03:40:31 <ZK> i remember watching both animes, and thinking DragonBall was a much better story
03:40:59 <ZK> but it's probably cause the themes resonate more with me, with dragon ball being more about having a cool adventure and learning new stuff
03:41:18 <ZK> while DBZ was more powering up and growing together
03:41:36 <Camail> this just in: wow fuck bleach, just read the wiki
03:41:51 <Camail> the ultimate deus ex machina
03:52:33 <Camail> some things happen in bleach because the characters really really want them to happen
03:58:42 <ZK> lol what
03:59:53 <Camail> there's a thing, where its power is literally to make desires come true
04:00:05 <Camail> and APPARENTLY it was secretly around the main cast from the very beginning
04:00:17 <ZK> wow
04:00:22 <Camail> so all the random contrivances are hand waved away
04:05:35 <Camail> yea, good series
04:05:53 <ZK> i remember reading death not
04:06:01 <ZK> that was fun, but stopped after a while
04:06:09 <ZK> also read the Gamer for a while, but i think thats korean
04:06:29 <Camail> I watched a decent amount of the anime, then the last episode
04:06:46 <ZK> only read halfway when a thing happens
04:06:52 <Camail> death note is pretty entertaining
04:07:00 <Camail> I'm just not a huuuuge fan of spy vs spy
04:07:08 <Camail> so i got a bit bored, but thats just me
