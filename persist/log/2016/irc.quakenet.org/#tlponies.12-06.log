01:52:38 <Bio> hello
01:53:18 <Camail> the finals of capcom cup were rebroadcast on espn2
01:53:24 <Camail> why does the fgc have these contacts
01:53:49 <Camail> all of a sudden traditional sports broadcasting is so cozy with fighting games
01:55:34 <motbob_> cause fighting games are literally a copy of a real sport
01:55:48 <motbob_> basically MMA except cheaper
01:55:51 <Bio> Especially the magic fire ball thing
01:55:52 <Bio> !
01:56:00 <Bio> =P
01:56:04 <motbob_> oh ya i guess there are magic fireballs and kicks
01:56:27 <motbob_> well if MMA had magic fireballs it would be even better
01:56:38 <motbob_> i bet that was the sales pitch at ESPN HQ
01:57:22 <motbob_> "it's mma... but there are fireballs and shit... and women are viable at a championship level"
01:57:41 <Bio> ITS GENIUS, IT IS
01:58:47 <motbob_> meanwhile counterstrike is a virtualization of an ongoing international tragedy
01:59:27 <motbob_> SC2 is the virtualization of a future galactic conflict in which billions of lives are lost
01:59:59 <motbob_> and Dota is the virtualization of a conflict that probably ends the universe once concluded
01:59:59 <Bio> I cri evri tiem
02:01:13 <motbob> anyway, it's way more palatable to have guys kicking the shit out of each other, is my point
02:02:17 <Bio> prolly
02:06:14 <Crisium> overwatch is accurate prediction of 60 years from now
02:07:52 <Camail> maaan i hope they give juri some nice stuff
02:08:12 <Bio> like costume?
02:08:39 <Crisium> like SF4 fireball pressure?
02:09:04 <Bio> but crisi whens mahvel?
02:09:23 <Camail> marvel is dead 
02:09:52 <Camail> if fireball was +1 on block that'd be nice, but that's boring
02:10:14 <motbob> oh, du won capcom cup
02:10:18 <motbob> that must have been hype
02:10:31 <Camail> it was hype in theory
02:10:36 <Camail> was kinda 8/10 because mika
02:10:42 <Camail> the games weren't very exciting
02:10:46 <Crisium> i was hoping for guile
02:10:57 <Camail> du made amazing reads to get in, then won
02:11:07 <motbob> so just variance
02:11:31 <Camail> he didn't random out, he totally earned it
02:11:43 <motbob> should I go back and watch the vods? i heard there were production problems?
02:11:47 <Camail> he never lost a set, and never went 3-2
02:11:59 <Camail> i dunno if its worth it if you dont know the game
02:12:09 <motbob> i don't know any of the games I watch
02:12:34 <motbob> beyond what I would pick up by spectating
02:12:38 <Camail> also the commentary team on top 8 was awful
02:12:43 <Camail> it was the british guys
02:13:09 <Camail> i dont like their commentary style, and they havent gotten better after an entire year
02:13:17 <Camail> but usa, usa USA
02:13:24 <Camail> we are the victory winners
02:15:03 <Camail> oh shit mika got her bnb removed
02:15:04 <Camail> ahaaaa
02:15:48 <Bio> STAR SPANGLED BEATDOWN
02:16:57 <Camail> oh, all meterless DPs lose to meaties? thats interesting
02:17:04 <Camail> season 2 changes, fyi
02:17:40 <Bio> I recognize some of these words
02:18:46 <Crisium> oh the changes are out?
02:18:54 <Camail> no just the reported ones
02:19:19 <Camail> the irish whip nerf is 100% gonna happen tho
02:19:29 <Camail> these were all in the psx build
02:19:42 <Camail> they made all of sims long limbs +
02:19:57 <Camail> thet'llb e interesting
02:20:17 <Camail> chun can piano legs now for no reason
02:20:30 <Camail> if they make it piano only i am legit changing mains

03:40:50 <motbob> Anime reviews: non non biyori is like that time when I was driving down the pennsylvania turnpike and the most brilliant rainbow appeared in front of all the drivers in the horizon. As I drove further I saw many cars pulled over with drivers getting out just so they could see the sight more clearly. Non Non Biyori is the awe we all felt in sharing that moment condensed into anime form
03:42:25 <motbob> Golden Time is the most uncomfortable anime I've watched in my life, and I think about 75% is intentional on the part of the writer. Answers the question, if you have amnesia, what happens to the "self" that existed before you had amnesia?
03:43:45 <motbob> Log Horizon is a well-executed piece of "trapped-in-a-fantasy-world" world-building, way better than (for example) that dungeon show with the blue ribbon girl
03:43:58 <motbob> Thank you for reading Motbob's Anime Reviews
03:44:23 <motbob> Also, Railgun is an awful show that's only partly redeemed by really good production
03:50:23 <Camail> i heard log horizon was good but never got around to watching it
03:50:30 <Camail> making fun of SAO is fun tho
03:52:12 <motbob> while I'm making weird comparisons, the first 10 episodes of Log Horizon are the most fun parts of learning EVE Online condensed into anime form
03:53:18 <motbob> and... Golden Time is like having a charismatic but mentally unstable gf, but that comparison is cheating because one of the main characters is a charismatic but mentally unstable gf
03:55:15 <Camail> fiction is all a lie so you can make any comparison and its not cheating at all!
