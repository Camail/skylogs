11:56:52 <Dot_> I dont even understand how bitcoin gets its worth
11:58:23 <reification> because it is in certain aspects the best availble money currently
12:00:15 <Dot_> so its worth is based partialy on ease of use?
12:01:23 <reification> yes
12:03:21 <reification> a fair amount of the price of btc is speculative so it tends to be unstable
12:05:32 <reification> the thing that would really kick off btc adoption would be capital controls like cyprus did

20:47:27 <FlutterAi> lemme try that.
20:47:31 <DoT|Phone1> hmm. Will grab the error in a bit. not near pc right now
20:47:36 <Camail> yea
20:47:53 <Camail> the internet is saturated with undertale spoilers
20:48:16 <Camail> and being spoiled ruins what makes the game great

20:58:25 <DoT|Phone1> cam. How's you D3 going
20:58:29 <FlutterAi> damn nope, that didn't fix it
20:59:04 <FlutterAi> I've run into a problem in D3. too many friends.
20:59:08 <Camail> very slow
20:59:12 <Camail> was away all weekend and monday
20:59:15 <Camail> also it hurts to play
20:59:21 <Camail> its the only game that ir eally cant play  whole lot
20:59:22 <FlutterAi> XD I bet you're higher paragon level than me tho.
20:59:28 <Camail> because for some reason its the mouse mouse-intensive
20:59:35 <Camail> sc2 isnt even as bad, not even close
20:59:38 <DoT|Phone1> :(

21:00:17 <BioPhone> Pony
21:00:17 <FlutterAi> :c oh
21:00:24 <Camail> the problem is i dont really WANT to play, because it hurts
21:00:29 <Camail> its not a game i seek out
21:01:19 <DoT|Phone1> I have a friend I might try get back into cs with
21:01:34 <DoT|Phone1> so I can disappoint you again
21:01:40 <Camail> thats good
21:01:47 <Camail> are they new as well
21:01:52 <DoT|Phone1> yea
21:02:16 <Camail> perfect
21:02:21 <Camail> also you'll derank SUPER quick
21:02:29 <Camail> because 1. ranke degredation
21:02:30 <DoT|Phone1> someone to be bad with
21:02:35 <Camail> 2. new ranking system
21:02:56 <DoT|Phone1> Oh they fixed to many high ranked ppl?
21:02:59 <Camail> you'll probably go down to like gold nova 1 once you get reranked
21:03:11 <Camail> yea they didnt change the MMR system but they changed public ranks
21:03:23 <Camail> so the average was forced back down to gn4
21:03:32 <DoT|Phone1> cool
21:03:42 <Camail> its purely cosmetic in a way
21:03:50 <Camail> its helps psycologically i guess
21:04:51 <Camail> there are a million ways to practice csgot hat aren't MM so its really just good for the masses

21:46:35 <FlutterAi> yes :c
21:46:42 <DoT`> then reinstalled

21:47:26 <FlutterAi> my problem would be that I've already played for hours >_> and now I'm getting this problem
21:47:33 <BioPhone> Still alive
21:47:37 <FlutterAi> uninstalling would... undo all that
21:48:00 <Camail> uninstalling doesnt do anything to save data
21:48:12 <Camail> save info is in different locations
21:49:07 <Camail> disabling anti-virus, running as admin, I dunno, it seems like a BEX error is not a usual undertale error
21:49:13 <Camail> will keep looking
21:49:45 <FlutterAi> Camail: I was told uninstalling is the only way to get a true reset
21:50:12 <FlutterAi> I assumed it'd mess me up if I tried that ;p
21:50:13 <Camail> 1. shush
21:50:16 <Camail> dont spoil
21:50:21 <Camail> and also no

21:50:37 <Camail> for any game

21:51:18 <FlutterAi> :o this may be the answer! :D
21:51:44 <Camail> it seems like this is a problem on 32 bit systems
21:52:08 <DoT`> mines 64 bit
21:52:14 <FlutterAi> same >_>' 
21:52:43 <Camail> ah
21:52:46 <DoT`> i tihnk i broke sometihng
21:52:49 <Camail> well, this should work
21:53:08 <Camail> while following the video?

21:59:48 <Zounds> is that a reference to something cr
21:59:58 <Zounds> cuz I think ponies are the size of ponies
22:00:43 <DoT`> those are some pretty large cats 
22:00:43 <Rawr|Fone> Ponies are definitely not the size of cats
22:01:12 <DoT`> rawr sized cats
22:01:19 <Rawr|Fone> :o
22:02:28 <Zounds> unless everything in equestria is proportionately smaller
22:02:36 <CockRoach|42> it's a reference to the name of the fic
22:02:45 <CockRoach|42> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/176021
22:02:50 <DoT`> it might be bigger zounds!
22:03:23 <Zounds> everything is proportionately chubbier
22:04:20 <DoT`> didt work cam
22:04:26 <DoT`> did not
22:05:40 <Phearlock> I should read that fic
22:05:43 <Phearlock> It looks cute
22:05:58 <Phearlock> probably a dead fic though
22:06:00 <Phearlock> oh well
22:06:13 <Phearlock> Oh wait, not a story fic
22:06:19 <Phearlock> so standalone-y chapters, cool

22:37:12 <CockRoach|42> .roll d20 to sleep
22:38:30 <FlutterAi> maybe... maybe this is why most of my friends have less than 10 hours in undertale ._.

23:28:54 <Camail> DoT`  are you using the steam beta?
23:29:44 <Camail> its might be the game
23:29:47 <Camail> DuB`  you there?
23:30:13 <Camail> DoT`  maybe try opting out of beta, FlutterAi  too if you are using it
23:31:40 <Camail> there might've been a steam update that broke undertale
23:31:47 <Camail> today
23:31:55 <Camail> which would explain the lack of documentaiton about this problem
23:32:17 <FlutterAi> opting out :p
23:32:17 <Camail> there's only one google result where the fault module was undertale.exe for a bex error
23:32:29 <Camail> and the person said thats how they fixed it
23:32:51 <FlutterAi> are there any steam features only in beta, anyways?
23:32:58 <FlutterAi> I was opted in for no particular reason
23:34:20 <Camail> no
23:34:23 <Camail> not anymore at the moment
23:34:25 <Camail> i dont think
23:34:42 <Camail> did it work?
23:36:18 <FlutterAi> Camail: lemme see if download finished :p
23:36:25 <FlutterAi> still installing
23:36:39 <FlutterAi> it had a small download to opt out, but I have slow internets
23:37:09 <Camail> ah
23:38:59 <FlutterAi> Camail: fixed
23:42:02 <Camail> ok good
23:42:05 <Camail> thats the reason, then
23:42:09 <Camail> DoT`  we figured it out
23:43:03 * FlutterAi gives steam beta the finger >:C
