14:05:30 <DoT`> today is proving otherwise
14:06:08 <Rawr|Fone> That is definitely not true
14:13:02 <DuB`> Dot!
14:13:07 <DuB`> I have been so productive!
14:13:21 <DuB`> I can play for a while tomorrow, and maybe some today. :)
14:13:25 <DoT`> oh?
14:13:30 <DoT`> yay
14:16:24 <DuB`> Will we brave the horrors of duo queue with strangers?
14:16:52 <DoT`> uhm
14:16:58 <DoT`> this seems a big step
14:17:15 <DuB`> It'll be the only way I get rank before... may? :P
14:17:29 <DuB`> Cam gave up on us for a while, you know!
14:17:45 <DuB`>  We have to be independent!
14:17:54 <DoT`> abandond!
14:18:04 <reification> you should stream it
14:18:29 <reification> then i can give helpful advice like ‚Äúshoot them before they shoot you‚Äù
14:18:46 <DuB`> :D
14:19:06 <DuB`> I could strim.
14:21:14 <DuB`> But I dunno if I should willingly trasmit such bad and salt and sad to other people unnecessarily.
14:22:04 <reification> but that is what streaming is for!
14:22:58 <DuB`> Kappa
14:26:35 <DuB`> Ooooooh.
14:27:10 <DuB`> Uni has a program where if you're taking certain  language classes you can live in the foreign langauge student housing.
14:28:21 <reification> and are you taking those certain classes?
14:28:47 <DuB`> Possibly next semester, depends.
14:29:01 <DuB`> If I make it into the program I WANT after this semester, then no.
14:29:30 <DuB`> If I don't make it and have to start on some other requisites then I could fit it. :T
14:29:35 <DuB`> Darn.
14:29:50 <DuB`> So... it would be like a consolation prize.
14:29:58 <reification> well it‚Äôs good to have backup plan
14:30:00 <DuB`> Or wait until senior year.
14:30:11 <DuB`> Yah.
14:30:22 <DuB`> Honestly, if I don't make it then I have some serious rethinking to do.
14:30:38 <DuB`> Like, at least another year of school to get set up for a different program. :(
14:30:49 <reification> i got extra uni housing cause i was a work placement student
14:31:04 <DuB`> :O ?
14:31:15 <reification> sounds expensive and annoying dub
14:31:47 <reification> my degree had a year of work placement in the middle
14:31:56 <reification> very useful for ¬£¬£¬£
14:32:21 <DuB`> Oh, interesting.
14:32:29 <DuB`> That's pretty cool.
14:33:04 <reification> also over summer break but that was extra cause i got sponsored
14:33:13 <DuB`> The financial accounting program I'm aiming for (and SO FAR on track for) is like, top 3 in the world consistently.
14:33:16 <DuB`> And hard. :P
14:33:30 <DuB`> I'd not have much free time for the next year and a half or so...
14:33:40 <reification> :/
14:33:52 <DoT`> most course i see nowdays are you can choose like 3 year, 4 year, or 3 year with an extra year in the middle as work placement
14:33:57 <DuB`> What major is that by the way, reif?
14:34:08 <reification> you already left us for about that long dub! :(
14:34:17 <reification> elec eng

20:11:00 <Camail> whyyyy is emily gonna be an option...
20:11:14 <DoT`> its so wrong
20:11:29 <Camail> how about instead of spending time making more romance scene, we advance actual character development and respect the NPCs at all
20:11:36 <Camail> i have a legitimate problem with this one
20:12:15 <Camail> if you become friends with clint before romancing her this is especially fucked up
20:12:39 <DoT`> and i didnt realise ppl liked shane and hated the smith so much :/
20:13:38 <Camail> i wish he would focus on making the game better, not bigger
20:13:45 <Camail> but i dont think he can
20:13:57 <Camail> both because i dont think he's a good enough writer and i tihnk he's way too close to the game
20:14:09 <Camail> and all he can rely on is fan feedback
20:14:17 <Camail> which reduces to 'LOLSO ADDICTING GIVE MORE'
20:14:54 <ZK> emily... who is she again?
20:15:00 <DoT`> Blue hair
20:15:05 <ZK> oh bar girl?
20:16:19 <DoT`> yes
20:18:16 <Camail> both
20:18:24 <Camail> er, ignore that
20:31:48 <DoT`> ok

20:37:34 <Camail> maaaan dot, i wish there was a game we could play
20:37:56 <Camail> I'm reeling close to a gn4 demote
20:38:02 <Camail> feeling*
20:38:14 <DoT`> pff please drop further
20:38:25 <Bio> freefall pon
20:39:05 <Camail> omg i played soloq at mg1 last night
20:39:08 <Camail> it was THE WORST
20:39:21 <Camail> first team completely gave up after going 0-7
20:39:40 <Camail> second team had a toxic guy that made everyone tilt
20:40:33 <Camail> its way less shitty at LE
20:40:36 <Camail> and that's saying something
20:40:59 <Camail> because at LE it still sucks, but i wouldn't even play csgo if i had to climb the ranks now
20:41:45 <skram> soloq to global is nearly impossible
20:41:58 <DoT`> :/
20:45:09 <Camail> soloq to supreme is impossible, now
20:45:29 <Camail> i have a friend whose been trying for a few weeks and he is very capable of doing it
20:45:46 <Camail> but hackers and assholes
20:46:25 <skram> Most "serious" players and stacks have moved to faceit anyway
20:46:52 <Camail> in NA its all esea
20:46:58 <Camail> which I'm gonna have to buy soon
20:47:01 <Camail> if i want to play this game
20:47:06 <skram> :(
20:47:10 <skram> atleast faceit is free
20:48:02 <Camail> I'd be fine playing faceit with tlp, no rank restrictions, true smurfing
20:49:57 <Camail> also dont need 5
20:49:59 <Camail> which helps
20:50:26 <skram> well true but always better with 5
20:50:36 <skram> lotsa toxic fuckers on faceit too
20:52:09 <Camail> yea but 3 stack vs not playing at all
20:52:22 <skram> fair enough
20:52:46 <Camail> i dont really mind playing with randoms if i have at least 1 person to complain to on steam chat
20:53:13 <Phearlaptop> I remembered it was a long time since I had anything really spicy
20:53:30 <Phearlaptop> So I had some spicy sauce and was reminded why I rarely eat really spicy stuff.
20:53:35 <Phearlaptop> <3 milk
20:53:59 <Golly> ?silly
20:54:04 <Phearlaptop> Very
20:54:45 <carcinisation> won 3 twisters in a row, too bad they were only 2x multiplier
20:57:21 <ZK> when you say twister, you do mean that game with the four colors where you stretch and place yourself in awkward positions right?
20:58:28 <carcinisation> if i was doing that i wouldn't be in irc
20:58:33 <carcinisation> poker ofc
20:58:48 <carcinisation> with the wheel of fortune at the start to determine payout
21:04:24 <carcinisation> anyway i start hike early tomorrow so
21:04:26 <ZK> its funnier if i imagine you playing twister
21:04:30 <carcinisation> g'night all
21:04:36 <ZK> are you hikinh up to DoT`?
21:04:38 <skram> good night reif

21:04:55 <carcinisation> dot is a bit far away
21:05:15 <carcinisation> actually hike trail ends in france but i'm not going that far
21:06:26 <ZK> gnite reif
21:08:44 <DoT`> weird 
21:08:50 <DoT`> my cs jst closed
21:08:57 <DoT`> no crash report
21:09:48 <ZK> i take credit for that crash
21:12:34 <DoT`> the onyl thing that occured was a dns ping timed out >.>

22:46:09 <Camail> you cant get less than 8 hours of sleep at that point
22:48:14 <DuB`> You forget the reason I do that in the first place.
22:48:19 <DuB`> Which would be 4:30 work.
22:52:10 <skram> quit job get credit card
22:53:40 <Camail> ^
22:58:20 <DuB`> Quit job, quit school, go full time games and buy knives and keys.
22:59:23 <skram> get fat and annoying and you too can be shit at CS and lose all your money on gambling
23:03:13 <DoT`> and go live with skram, he will support you

23:13:10 <Camail> because mm is super inconvenient for us
23:13:15 <Camail> forces us to play with full stacks
23:13:27 <skram> i dont mind losing all my mmr on faceit too
23:13:46 <DoT`> i dont really understand this faceit, is it just another MM? how does it link?
23:14:36 <skram> you go to a website and it matches you against another team and then it gives you an ip for a server that runs a script for your match
23:15:08 <DoT`> not tonight, but im happy to try it
