05:34:49 <Camail> .tell dot` PENNY GETS EVEN MORE DEPRESSING LATER, WTF
05:35:04 <Camail> .tell dot` SHE A LIVING BREATHING VERSION OF THE EPISODE WITH FRY'S DOG
05:45:45 <motbob> Crisium, you should have taken an introductory business finance coursse
05:45:57 <motbob> otherwise, you won't have a good sense of which crops to buy
05:46:18 <Crisium> well im an american
05:46:23 <Crisium> so im inclined to grow corn
05:46:29 <motbob> specifically you should be familiar with how to calculate a rate of return
05:46:30 <Crisium> because it will be subsidized
05:49:10 <Camail> cranberries for life
05:52:12 <Camail> though the idea of scaling up preserves jars in year 2 or 3 seems really appealing
05:52:20 <Camail> especially if you can get like 50
06:01:24 <Camail> my cucumber is 31 in. long
06:01:30 <Camail> so alpha
06:03:27 <Crisium> also like my real life
06:04:26 <Camail> Not me, I'm more of a 3 footer
06:05:00 <Camail> fishing in this game is relaxing... everything else is stressful, always doing something
06:05:28 <Camail> fishing is waiting, strategic placement, and a simple and direct mechanic to learn
06:05:54 <Camail> to the point where after 1 day of fishing in a single area you can know which fish you are catching depending on how the fish moves
06:06:04 <Camail> or at least narrowing it down to 2
06:06:17 <Camail> a lot of lake fish have similar difficulty
06:06:55 <Camail> my favorite are tuna and bigmouth bass, just difficult enough to be interesting but not gonna fail you
06:11:26 <motbob> new strat: no upgraded tools until winter
06:11:52 <Camail> makes sense
06:11:57 <Camail> investing in what, then
06:12:34 <Camail> honestly its super easy to make a shit ton of money in this game if thats all you want to do
06:12:56 <Camail> it takes me 2 hours to to maintain what i ahve, the rest of the day is socializing or mining or fishing
06:13:25 <Camail> a person could easily support 200 crops with the basic equipment if they cut out all socializing except birthdays
06:13:34 <Camail> and all mining unless its raining
06:14:13 <Camail> having 60 crops each season is gonna net me 100k int he first 3 seasons
06:14:27 <Camail> you could double that
06:14:32 <Camail> fairly easily
06:16:35 <motbob> investing in socializing basically
06:16:58 <motbob> make nothing but parsnips
06:17:06 <motbob> give people parsnips for the whole year
06:17:28 <motbob> LOL is this actually my strat? I sure am making a lot of parsnips but I don't think that was a conscious decision
06:18:38 <Camail> are parsnips really the best option in spring? the other seasons to take kindly to quick turnover crops.
06:18:42 <Camail> i guess 1st spring
06:19:09 <motbob> it's the best rate of return
06:19:43 <motbob> you just upgrade to potatos when the size of the farm tires you out
06:19:52 <motbob> potatoes are almost as good. Kale too.
06:20:21 <motbob> Cauliflower sucks, beans suck
06:20:39 <Camail> is it only 1 bean per harvest
06:20:44 <motbob> tulips are good and cheap and you can give them to abigail
06:20:53 <Camail> many of the other stalk crops have 3 per harvest
06:20:54 <motbob> it's 1 bean but you get more beans every 4 days
06:20:58 <Camail> ew
06:21:07 <Camail> blueberries give you 3 per harvest
06:21:23 <motbob> i didn't calculate summer crops yet but blueberries HAVE to be the best
06:21:53 <Camail> strawberries look to be the best
06:21:59 <Camail> for spring
06:22:07 <Camail> provided you plant day 1
06:22:23 <Camail> which is basically useless when you can only plant 5
06:22:32 <Camail> spring crops fucking suck
06:22:58 <motbob> well
06:23:03 <motbob> you can't buy seeds
06:23:09 <Camail> oh right
06:23:12 <Camail> all the intro stuff
06:23:18 <motbob> i mean
06:23:23 <Camail> parsnips are the best option for 1st year, yea
06:23:25 <motbob> you can't buy them until egg festival
06:23:38 <Camail> hm?
06:23:45 <Camail> i dont recall why
06:23:52 <motbob> well they're not in the store
06:23:56 <Camail> ohhh right
06:23:57 <Camail> yea
06:24:08 <Camail> guess you gotta stock up for the next year
06:24:13 <Camail> bleh
06:24:15 <motbob> well that's like saying
06:24:16 <Camail> so not worth it
06:24:25 <motbob> let's not have 1000g for 1 year
06:24:36 <Camail> and that 1k turns into so much more over a year
06:24:41 <motbob> right
06:24:46 <Camail> so its totally not worth it year 1 or 2
06:24:51 <Camail> which means its a year 3 optimal crop
06:24:58 <Camail> which is w/e
06:25:11 <motbob> let me calculate the rate of return if you buy strawberries a year in advance actually
06:25:14 <Camail> the second house upgrade costs 50k, so who knows how expensive stuff gets
06:25:32 <Camail> the opportunity costs is immense
06:25:59 <Camail> you could use that money to make more profit on parsnips, then use that all on blueberries
06:27:31 <motbob> parsnips rate of return is 15%/day, strawberries a year in advance is 2%
06:27:32 <motbob> lawl
06:27:51 <motbob> potatoes and kale are 12% FYI
06:28:14 <motbob> no i'm sorry, potatoes and tulip, kale is worse
06:29:42 <Camail> but tulips have like, no profit margin
06:29:50 <Camail> 6 days, 30g per flower, 20g seeds
06:31:22 <motbob> oh they're 30? i had them writetn down as 40
06:31:31 <motbob> my b
06:31:38 <motbob> that changes it obviously
06:32:06 <motbob> sothe only crops that aren't in the dumpster are parsnips/potatoes
06:33:09 <Camail> if you fund everyone with parsnips, gus will be your best friend
06:33:14 <Camail> he like them more than everyone else
06:33:43 <Micen> today is a sad day. Just leanred that Everquest Next has finally, offically been axed. 
06:34:03 <Camail> awww
06:34:05 <Micen> i mean i knew it for awhile, but sitll sad to see something i was keeping on my radar killed
06:34:17 <Camail> rip everquest
06:34:31 <Micen> but hey http://pantheonmmo.com/ is in production
06:34:32 <motbob> i got pam to 6 hearts on spring 18
06:34:35 <motbob> with parsnips

06:34:53 <Camail> fuck pam, she sucks
06:35:08 <Camail> oh shit, apaprently pam loves parsnips
06:35:11 <Micen> wow Cam, maybe some people like Pam. 
06:35:17 <Camail> no one likes pam
06:35:24 <Camail> thats why she's drunk and alone
06:35:36 <Camail> lmao she likes parsnip soup
06:35:41 <Camail> this bitch is 1 dimensional as fuck
06:36:35 <Camail> I FOUND HIS PANTS MOT

06:48:51 <Camail> joja
06:49:18 <motbob> ohhhhh

06:50:46 <motbob> i talked to her in joja
06:50:54 <motbob> she said, "I could go for some parsnips"

09:42:00 <motbob> camail peppers are better than blueberries
09:45:34 <motbob> but, seeing as how you have to water them both throughout the season, and blueberries pack more value into one square of watering, for sanity's sake it may be better to go with blueberries
09:46:26 <motbob> also, wheat's better than everything
09:47:00 <Camail> the wiki says  10g per day trough an entire season of peppers
09:47:06 <Camail> you et 40g per pepper
09:47:17 <motbob> fuck the wiki listen to me
09:47:25 <motbob> g/day is a garbage stat
09:47:35 <Camail> why
09:47:53 <motbob> because of the reinvestment issue
09:48:05 <motbob> opportunity cost
09:48:38 <Camail> ah
09:49:14 <motbob> you can say cauliflower is higher g/day than parsnips but you can a) buy more parsnips and b) buy new parsnips after you made profit on your old parsnips, meanwhile the cauliflower is still growing
09:49:30 <Camail> yaya, got it
09:49:36 <Camail> its just 4 am so not quite thinking
09:50:02 <motbob> i guess on two crops where they both grow all season the only issue is whether you want to water twie as many crops for slightly better return
09:50:12 <motbob> the answer to which may be "HELL NO"
09:50:14 <Camail> or if you can
09:50:18 <Camail> depending on your upgrades
09:50:37 <motbob> so I may just plant blueberries with some peppers to give to shane
09:50:48 <Camail> and lewis
09:51:04 <motbob> idk what to grow as cheap gifts
09:51:30 <motbob> corn is beyond garbage in terms of return
09:51:40 <motbob> can't give wheat
09:51:50 <motbob> camail, what do you usually give as gifts
09:52:33 <Camail> i dont do mass gift giving, I'm focusing on 10-ish people for the first year
09:53:02 <Camail> it would pobably be more efficient to do it that way
09:53:07 <Camail> but too mcuh walking
09:53:18 <Camail> i barely have a manageable route through town as it is
09:53:48 <Camail> but as far as i can tell, honey is a generally good choice
09:53:49 <motbob> i might have to start maintaining friendships instead of growing them without the Parsnip Factor
09:54:09 <Camail> flowers are good generally
09:54:25 <Camail> for women
09:54:31 <Camail> dont really know any particulars about guys
09:54:51 <motbob> actually during summer you can just forage
09:54:59 <Camail> you could try planting the cheapest crop again and seeing how it goes
09:55:14 <motbob> that's wheat. don't try to gift wheat.
09:56:25 <Camail> going into the mines is useful, as many people like or love gems
09:56:51 <motbob> i have money now
09:56:57 <motbob> maybe i can raise animals finall

11:48:43 <Camail> everything else is really common

20:22:37 <Camail> mannnnn, i feel like I'm having a character crisis
20:22:41 <Camail> but its pixel art romance
20:22:45 <Camail> fuck this game
20:23:21 <Camail> the worst part is that whoever i pick is just gonna...be there. Like, I'm gonna be spending a shit ton more time in this game and they'll just always be hanging around
20:23:23 <DoT|Phone> game is srs
20:23:35 <Camail> I feel like that is the smallest glimpse into actual marriage
20:24:15 <Camail> I'm starting to do a utilitarian analysis on this shit
20:24:19 <Camail> and i dont even like those!
20:24:58 <Camail> abigail confessed her love via a fucking spirit board dot
20:25:03 <Camail> she is at most 12 years old
20:25:06 <Camail> that's what 12 year olds do.
20:25:15 <DoT|Phone> hahaha
20:25:47 <Camail> ok thats a spoiler my bad, but i am distracted!
20:26:03 <Camail> maybe i sohuld just pity marry penny
20:26:11 <Camail> if i cant decide between 2, take the third
20:26:22 <DoT|Phone> that scene glitched and skipped for me
20:26:27 <CockRoach|42> .tell Rawr|Phone http://imgur.com/gallery/bxu1DN9
20:26:33 <Camail> aw, that sucks
20:26:36 <Camail> it was a charming scene
20:26:40 <Camail> well, you'll see it again
20:26:46 <Camail> since your so adamantly team pedo
20:27:32 <DoT|Phone> nah. it was a tough choice between her and Leah. but I think Leah this time. the goth thing annoys me
20:27:44 <DoT|Phone> and that ginny pig
20:27:56 <Camail> see, i like the aesthetic  but not the shitty poems
20:28:03 <Camail> and those are just inseperable for goths
20:30:30 <DoT|Phone> Leah is nice and practical
20:30:48 <Camail> yea she fits really nicely into your lifestyle
20:30:55 <Camail> but in a way so does abigail, if you like the mining
20:31:12 <DoT|Phone> she cowers from a bat
20:31:18 <DoT|Phone> so 12
20:31:37 <Camail> there's nature,mining,family; which is leah,abigail,penny
20:31:44 <DoT|Phone> but as I said. tough choice
20:31:55 <motbob> penny seems like the best choice in terms of what marriage in this game actually is; that is, a cage
20:32:02 <DoT|Phone> lol
20:32:20 <Camail> I mean, there is growth for the characters in some cases
20:32:41 <Camail> like, you help support leah and allow her to express herself through her art to the public
20:33:08 <Camail> without the MC's interventiont hat wouldn't happen
20:33:53 <Camail> now, after the actual marriage maybe its kinda...limiting
20:34:10 <Camail> i imagine that's where the game content ends
20:34:33 <Phearlock> That's often how shipfics end too.
20:34:46 <Phearlock> Yay they got together, story is over, lived happily ever after
20:35:11 <Phearlock> Only a few manage to put content AFTER the shipping happens.
20:36:29 <DoT|Phone> what about the second house upgrade?
20:36:48 <Camail> what about it

21:21:29 <Micen> i would guess snow
21:21:47 <Camail> micen, half this game's worth is its nature sprite art
21:21:53 <Camail> if i were to deprive myself of the reveal
21:21:56 <Micen> i know
21:21:59 <Camail> kinda lessens the experience
21:22:06 <Camail> for me,a t least
21:22:14 <Micen> i need to get back to playing
21:22:24 <Camail> its strength certianly isnt character sprites
21:22:25 <Camail> god no
21:22:44 <Micen> agreed
21:22:51 <DoT|Phone> lol
21:24:06 <motbob> [15:16:43] <+Camail> are there any spoilers

21:38:35 <Camail> abigail is the only one who just straight up says she likes you, I'm getting nothing from leah
21:38:46 <DoT|Phone> ruude
21:39:37 <DoT|Phone> what about Haley
21:39:41 <DoT|Phone> Haha
21:39:50 <Camail> I don't hate her anymore
21:39:54 <Camail> that's as good as it gets for her.
21:41:15 <Camail> ok so i think i have to say no to abigail, on the count of her being a baby goth teen girl
21:41:21 <Camail> everything about her screams teen phases
21:41:36 <Camail> desire to explore, get out of the house away from parents, being a goth in general
21:41:50 <DoT|Phone> "im not in a good mood right now"
21:41:52 <DoT|Phone> lol
21:42:09 <Camail> i feel like you don't actually know who she is or what she stands for because she isn't old enough to figure it out
21:42:46 <Camail> so its between leah and penny now. I've officially struck abigail off the list
21:43:10 <Camail> the MC can be abigails first lost love
21:43:19 <Camail> maybe a mistress once she hits 20
21:44:22 <Camail> if she had one of her earlier deisgns with blue hair this would be more difficult to decide
21:44:23 <Camail> http://stardewvalleywiki.com/File:Abigail_Timeline.png
21:45:55 <DoT|Phone> wow she looks young in some of those
21:46:54 <Camail> YUP

22:08:48 <yolteotl_> Ubisoft Micen. You shound never buy a ubisoft gamr
22:08:53 <Micen> The thing that sold us on it was The Dark Zone pvp area. 
22:09:06 <yolteotl_> Or just if it is a Anno game
22:09:21 <Micen> I thought itr was going to be more wild west loot hunting in NYC there
22:09:39 <Micen> but its just more PVE where you occasionally might see someone else. 
22:10:09 <DuB`> OOOKAY. 
22:10:18 <DoT`> cam, i got a diamond and fossil and the same fishing chest! the gods where kind

22:10:31 <Micen> Now farm dub!
22:10:55 <DuB`> Nu.
22:11:01 <DoT`> micen, i played the open beta and the dark zone was packed
22:11:08 <DoT`> full of bastards
