00:46:23 <Micen> Dot snela.
00:51:09 <Camail> that was interesting dot
00:51:13 <Camail> 4 sirens would be funny
00:51:19 <Dot_> no one moves
00:51:21 <Dot_> ever
00:51:21 <Camail> ever
00:51:59 <Dot_> wonder how mutch damage 4 sirens do with that on things that cant be lifted
00:52:03 <Dot_> if its noticable
00:52:47 <Dot_> i want to see where the res skill is
00:54:26 <Dot_> im getting longer phase lock and the skill that causes it to pul things in
00:54:43 <Dot_> then will either get the reduced cool down or work on the center tree
00:55:15 <Camail> i have 0 clue what i want with the siren
00:55:24 <Camail> i dont think i will ever love a class as much as assasin tho
00:55:36 <Dot_> on the siren i feel each has good stuff but also uselss stuff
00:55:37 <Camail> because the guns in this game are all just amde so much better
00:55:40 <Dot_> its a bit annoying
00:55:48 <Camail> yea i tried the healing thing
00:55:52 <Camail> but i kinda dont like it
00:55:56 <Camail> healing int his game is kinda meh
00:56:41 <Dot_> besides the res there isnt much in the center skill tree
00:56:48 <Dot_> the final thing might be good
00:56:59 <Dot_> but i actually dont think i will bother with that tree
00:58:16 <Dot_> i think a fair number of cataclysm skills work nicly with the skill that pulls in 
00:58:27 <Bio> nerd
00:58:30 <Bio> pons
00:58:35 <Camail> i was hoping that there was a way to be a strong support, but i guess its shootbangs all the way down
00:58:53 <Dot_> well im leveling my phaselock, its support
00:58:53 <Bio> best zapport prevents dmg by killing enemy
00:58:59 <Dot_> bioNerd
00:59:05 <Camail> also if we level up on our main group dub will have a problem
00:59:09 <Bio> um
00:59:11 <Camail> he doesnt have any of the dlc that raises level cap

01:36:35 <DuB`> SeemsGood
01:37:06 <Bio> why the fuk do you have a final on a saturday
01:37:12 <Bio> sue ur skool
01:37:18 <DuB`> :(
01:40:32 <DuB`> Dot_
01:40:49 <DuB`> I just took down the #2 26k snek as a 100 length snek.
01:40:58 <Dot_> :P
01:41:03 <DuB`> Immediate mass bloodshed and mayhem.
01:44:38 <Camail> did you scrap out of it on top
01:44:58 <Camail> also fuck you
01:45:02 <Camail> you are part of the problem
01:45:07 <Camail> you harpy!
01:45:17 <DuB`> I see myself as a lamprey.
01:45:27 <DuB`> I just stick to the side of a bigger organism.
01:45:33 <DuB`> ... and then stab it in the face, but hey.
01:45:40 <Camail> so evil
01:45:48 <Camail> parasitic snake
01:47:33 <Dot_> i circles a snake that was far larger than me but trying to contrict another
01:47:44 <Dot_> it hit me then so did the one he was contricting
01:47:59 <Dot_> so 2 snakes larger than me ded all mine
01:54:18 <Camail> the game gets so terrifying when its nothing but small snakes risking everything with nothing to lose
01:54:36 <Camail> people like dub
01:59:45 <Camail> omfg
02:00:03 <Camail> ramming headfirst into other snakes makes no sense
02:00:07 <Camail> why does the boosting one die
02:00:14 <Camail> thats a sack of bullshit
02:00:34 <Camail> i need to stop boosting so much
02:00:48 <Camail> especially once your like 8k+ its just...the worst
02:01:36 <Dot_> i got first and held it a while
02:01:38 <Dot_> im happy
02:01:50 <Dot_> yjtough 450 off 30k
02:01:52 <Dot_> damn
02:02:14 <Camail> omfg why
02:02:18 <Camail> there was a huge lag spike
02:02:21 <Camail> and everyone was dying
02:02:23 <Camail> i almost made it out
02:02:30 <Camail> but the snake lagged out and wouldnt turn
02:02:47 <Camail> I'm too impatient for this game
02:03:01 <Dot_> i play very aggressivly till im in top60 or so
02:03:07 <Dot_> notihng to loss till then really
02:03:13 <Camail> you are part of the problem
02:03:21 <Camail> which there was like a 2 miute respawn cooldown
02:03:23 <Dot_> i dont ram
02:03:47 <Dot_> and i make it to 60 about three quarters if the time
02:04:09 <Camail> i dont really pay attention to rank as much as size
02:05:02 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/geekandsundry
02:05:58 <Camail> put down the snakes
02:10:56 <Micen> well so much for arting after i ate

08:16:31 <Rawr|Phone> Hi cr
08:16:33 <DoT`> <3
08:17:22 <Rawr|Phone> <3
08:18:38 <Camail> dot people in slither are fucking insane at night
08:18:49 <DoT`> lol
08:18:54 <Camail> so many <500 guys just 100% boosting all the time
08:19:22 <DoT`> actually now you mention that i saw a few of those in my last 2 games last night
08:19:27 <DoT`> NA sneks
08:19:34 <Camail> died to one of those randos after being +1 for awhile, me and another blank name were 1 and 2 for like a minute before he died
08:19:56 <Camail> #1*
08:20:20 <DoT`> nice
08:20:25 <DoT`> what length?
08:21:13 <Camail> it was a super low pop server! like 20k 
08:21:23 <Camail> only like 300 people so there wasn't much to eat
08:21:33 <Camail> and so many crazy drivers
08:25:17 <DoT`> i died from a worm appeareaing in front of me
08:26:27 <Camail> git gud, i guess
08:29:03 <DoT`> i have woken up with a massive pain in my lower right back, i would greatly appreciate it easing up
08:29:51 <Camail> slither the pain away
08:31:25 <Camail> dot did you ever start watching critical role
08:31:43 <Camail> they're in a nice arc right now
08:32:50 <DoT`> now, there is so much to catch up on now, im not sure
08:33:42 <DoT`> no*
08:35:18 <Camail> I'd suggest it
08:35:44 <Camail> they're really starting to improve, clear story progression is happening
08:35:51 <Camail> the cntral arc of the campaign is happening
08:36:37 <Camail> and you have the freedom to skip through the videos instead of having to watch all of it live
08:36:54 <Camail> which cuts out like 30% of it if you are strict about it
08:37:16 <Camail> where did you last leave off
08:37:38 <Camail> did you watch the entirety of the underdark
08:38:02 <DoT`> I mean i never got anywhere with it, i got partway through the first ep once and had to afk, thats as close as ive gotten
08:38:09 <Camail> lol
08:38:18 <DoT`> there is a lot to watch
08:38:20 <Camail> theres like 160 hours of content 
08:38:32 <Camail> yup
08:39:12 <Camail> you kinda can start in medias res because the plot is simple
08:39:33 <Camail> but if you dont have the desire to watch the vods i dont think you would want to watch to begin with
08:40:52 <Camail> there was a funny development though, the druid notoriously misreads her spells and misunderstands them so like...everyone doesnt trust her anymore and kinda backseat drives her just a LITTLE bit
08:41:02 <DoT`> lol
08:41:04 <Camail> it was really obvious tonight
08:41:16 <Camail> its happened like every session
08:41:38 <DoT`> i think im just kinda daughnted by the number of players to keep track of and how much i would have to watch to catch up
08:41:46 <Camail> like yea these are busy people but god damn they have spent like 160 hours IN SESSION to learn this stuff
08:42:52 <DoT`> like i couldnt just open on the side and do other things while watching, i need to learn so many names and voices
08:42:56 <Camail> the number of player are easy to understand, angst twins, a pervert, a meathead, an airhead, a posh brit, and the occasional naive cleric
08:43:26 <Camail> after 1 episode its extremely easy
08:43:51 <DoT`> lol
08:43:57 <Camail> to the point where i point out the characters they VO for in games i play
08:44:02 <DoT`> i tihnk skram watches it
08:44:29 <Camail> like, its an audio book
08:44:37 <Camail> but its easier
08:44:42 <Camail> because each character has a diffeent voice

08:46:35 <DoT`> lol
08:46:40 <Camail> i should change the syntax for that command
08:47:20 <Camail> 'name,name,name msg' would probably be the most elegant way
08:47:30 <Camail> considering you cant put a , in a name
08:47:35 <Camail> at least i dont think you can
08:47:52 <Camail> yea you cant
08:48:02 <Camail> it just ignores the , and everything else after
08:49:12 <CockRoach|42> and that's also a correct way of using PRIVMSG
08:49:38 <CockRoach|42> at least for the nicknames
08:50:21 <motbob> tell'em
08:50:28 <Runbunny> Camail is still up? O:

08:51:41 <Runbunny> I found bullets that exactly one better than normal bullets.

14:59:31 <DoT`> when is strema
15:00:49 <Cane> DoT`, I wanted to get my TrackIR to work properly with Arma 3 before I got into it too much.
15:00:59 <Cane> It's the only game where if I use TrackIR, the game flickers in some instances.
15:01:11 <DoT`> hmm, annoying
15:01:30 <DoT`> arma is made of bugs, its all that holds it together
15:01:52 <DoT`> i love arma
15:02:12 <Cane> I adore Arma, I just want TrackIR to not be bugged.
15:03:14 <DoT`> you have 3 svreens right? you using it with that
15:03:55 <DoT`> actually im not sure how trackIR works
15:03:56 <Cane> I play most games on only one monitor, especially FPS titles.
15:03:59 <DoT`> ive never seen it
15:05:59 <Cane> TrackIR is a flight sim enthusiast piece of hardware. It offers headtracking in-game.
15:05:59 <DoT`> it tracks head motion
15:05:59 <Cane> Right.
15:05:59 <DoT`> yea, but i see that being annoying in an fps
15:05:59 <DuB`> Science-y.
15:05:59 <Cane> And it works in every other game I have.
15:05:59 <Cane> It WORKS in Arma, but in some special instances when I try to move my head, the game starts "flickering".
15:05:59 <Cane> Basically what it does is, instead of staying at the angle my head is tilted, every other frame it "flickers" back to neutral, frontal view.
15:05:59 <Cane> It's rare, but it's so annoying when it happens.
15:08:16 <Phearlock> ugh, yes
15:08:17 <DoT`> som soon you halv and i shall battle royale and die to lovly glitches!
15:11:10 <DoT`> i think me favourite BR glitch is early on when everyone was parachuted in, your parachute wouldnt open
15:12:20 <DoT`> reeds being bulletproof is a close second though

23:21:02 <ZK> shoot ppl, run. Free aim
23:21:08 <DuB`> He is the cod-hero.
23:22:45 <Bio> his shots are almost hitscan, so its good vs mobile heroes and flying heroes like pharah

23:22:57 <ZK> whats hitscan?
23:23:07 <Bio> pull trigger hit where cursor is
23:23:28 <Bio> as opposed to something like a rocket

23:23:31 <ZK> oh ok most others weapons arc down?
23:23:32 <Bio> that has a travel time
23:23:34 <DuB`> Nono

23:23:53 <Bio> tracer his hitscan, yeah
23:23:56 <Bio> is
