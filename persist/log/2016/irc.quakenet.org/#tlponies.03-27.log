13:45:56 <Yolteotl> !
13:46:35 <Yolteotl> almost back in business
13:46:59 <carcinisation> firefox working now
13:47:44 <carcinisation> your stack looks ok yolo
13:47:51 <Yolteotl> I was at 95k
13:47:57 <Yolteotl> then went down to 11k
13:47:57 <Yolteotl> :P
13:48:18 <Yolteotl> so... yes, now it is ok
13:48:46 <carcinisation> oh nice comeback
13:48:47 <Yolteotl> 77 players, 69 players paid places
13:49:39 <carcinisation> ah i assume that is why you are limping
13:49:48 <carcinisation> not that i approve still :p
13:50:25 <Yolteotl> you know I forgot almost every stuff you learned to me
13:50:27 <Yolteotl> I'm bad
13:51:04 <carcinisation> well based on these two hands game is very passive
13:51:20 <carcinisation> so not such a big mistake if ppl aren't gonna pressure you
13:51:20 <Yolteotl> yes, quiet table
13:51:58 <Yolteotl> nooooo
13:52:18 <carcinisation> ah that's sad
13:52:33 <Yolteotl> that was a lot to pay
13:52:35 <carcinisation> but a good fold i think
13:52:42 <Yolteotl> for the 70th place ::p
13:52:55 <carcinisation> you won't flop top 2 pair very often
13:53:13 <carcinisation> and he has you covered
13:53:16 <Yolteotl> this guy is verry aggressive
13:53:37 <carcinisation> indeed. i approve :p
13:54:43 <carcinisation> i would have overjammed the ATs vs this dude
13:55:13 <Yolteotl> at least
13:55:15 <Yolteotl> paid place
13:55:16 <Yolteotl> :P
13:55:18 <carcinisation> only given how active he has been
13:55:38 <carcinisation> oh right that does change things if still bubble
13:56:11 <carcinisation> but is bounty tourney so regular pay is less, maybe half.
13:56:47 <Yolteotl> I killed 2 players already
13:56:56 <Yolteotl> so i got my 5€ back
13:57:04 <Yolteotl> at least :)
13:57:30 <carcinisation> the ATs is a good shove generally in that spot i think cause you're gonna get called by a lot of hands you dominate as well as the times you pick up free chips
13:59:23 <carcinisation> vs a more standard player you may not be in such good shape tho
13:59:43 <Yolteotl> ok
13:59:45 <Yolteotl> :D
14:00:30 <carcinisation> oh no table move
14:00:48 <carcinisation> and you were just covering the guy with big bounty D:
14:02:47 <Yolteotl> ahah
14:03:00 <Yolteotl> 8.25€
14:03:09 <carcinisation> allin the TT
14:04:13 <carcinisation> hmm if you're only gonna raise then go smaller and fold that kind of flop imo
14:04:33 <Yolteotl> yes, I was a bit bored :P
14:04:37 <carcinisation> KQx is likely to hit at least one of the players and then you're pretty ded
14:04:53 <carcinisation> well you made profit :D
14:04:55 <carcinisation> gg
14:05:09 <carcinisation> it's sunny now here. back in a bit
