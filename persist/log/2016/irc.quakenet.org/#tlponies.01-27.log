00:32:27 <Camail> Cane if you ever plan on doing the pinkie pie cathedral, you can use my diamond blocks, so if you ever need me to log on and dump some stuff
00:32:36 <Camail> holla
00:32:54 <Camail> I should get back to that thing tho
00:33:14 <Cane> I need to update my scripts and do some bug squashing for the latest version of Minecraft before I start building again, will be a couple days.
00:33:28 <Cane> After that I did want to ask you if you wanted to find a good spot for the Pinkie cathedral.
00:33:35 <Cane> 'Cause that thing is awesome.
00:33:42 <Camail> well its not going anywhere, we've got all the time in the world
00:34:15 <Camail> I would feel obligated to help gather/build/polish the design
00:34:43 <Cane> It needs a nice, semi-secluded spot at least so that there's room for a nice big garden.

13:12:12 <Micen_> starcraft was all laggy for me, i stopped watching partway through creator game,.
13:13:29 <DoT`> :(
13:13:48 <Micen_> also, found out things are not so bad with my drive
13:14:45 <Micen_> they really lowballed the life of the SSDs the year mine came out and it still has like 4+ ish years of useable life yet before i have to panic
13:15:29 <DoT`> that makes no sense micen? so you said your drive was dying becuase thats what it said its life was on the box?
13:16:20 <Micen_> the datasheet is coded into the SSD, it hit 0% on its counter. 
13:16:36 <Micen_> its reporting wrong basically. 
13:20:33 <DoT`> I forgot SSD's have that silly system
13:21:02 <Micen_> yeah. it silly. 
13:21:10 <Micen_> i think a swede designed it
