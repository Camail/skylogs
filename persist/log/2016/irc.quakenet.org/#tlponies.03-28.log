00:41:03 <Camail> dot, dub got super sad last night after street fighting
00:41:12 <Camail> because he realized he was bad at everything
00:41:15 <Camail> grim days
00:41:51 <DoT`> why where you so mean to poor dubbles
00:46:24 <Camail> i cant help it
00:47:56 <DoT`> bio said he cant play till friday probably :(
00:58:35 <Rawr|Phone> üëªüëªüëª
01:00:37 <DoT`> and rawr doesnt play cs
01:01:21 <Rawr|Phone> I don't like fps games dot
01:01:26 <Camail> we could get zk 
01:02:35 <DoT`> but do we want zk
01:03:03 <Camail> no but its not about what we want
01:03:07 <Camail> this is life
01:03:10 <Camail> we make compromises
01:03:26 <DoT`> sacrifices*
01:04:10 <DoT`> but the question is, wil dub fail us
01:05:46 <Camail> is that a question
01:05:49 <Camail> or a certainty
01:06:04 <DoT`> i like to try optimisim now and then
01:06:08 <DoT`> so i can be dissapointed

01:51:58 <Camail> holy shit
01:52:01 <Camail> that conversion tho

02:12:49 <DoT`> hi moocen
02:20:03 <motbob> Camail, do street fighter tournaments always put the boring commentators on top 8
02:20:44 <Camail> ultrachen is great
02:20:55 <Camail> vast majority of people like them
02:21:01 <motbob> i'll defer to your judgment
02:21:29 <Camail> marvel commentary is just hoodmonkey noise
02:21:34 <Camail> this is actual commentary
02:21:41 <motbob> LOLLLLLLLLLL
02:21:44 <motbob> cmon
02:26:58 <Camail> I'd be interested to know why you think its boring, aside from the lack of screaming
02:28:55 <Camail> jesus tokido is so good
02:28:55 <motbob> idk
02:29:04 <motbob> yesterday i was watching mike ross and zhi
02:29:20 <motbob> what am i supposed to do when I get commentators that aren't that
02:31:02 <Camail> those two bring a lot of energy but not a lot of commentary
02:31:28 <Camail> it takes a lot of practice to be able to translate fighting games into english
02:33:23 <Camail> james chen just explained why shimmy's work, you'd never get that from any other pair
02:33:29 <Camail> magus1234 is good like that sometimes
02:33:36 <Camail> but again, he doesn't commentate much
02:34:40 <Camail> shimmies*
02:44:20 <motbob> ricky has the best gameface in esports i think
02:46:05 <Camail> ricki mad is best
02:46:09 <Camail> ricki and tokido
02:47:48 <Camail> get fukt marn
02:48:10 <Camail> lmfao
02:48:13 <Camail> the GG shirt
02:49:10 <motbob> what's the shirt
02:49:48 <Camail> in dust we trust
02:49:54 <Camail> theres a thing in guilty gear called dust
02:50:03 <Camail> also its more about him removing clothing
02:50:09 <Camail> and no one wanting to see him half naked
02:50:19 <Camail> buts its just funny to me to see him wearing a gg shirt
02:52:51 <Camail> please ricki...please
02:54:26 <Camail> he needs to shimmy way more
02:57:14 <Camail> fuck me
02:57:36 <Camail> marn's guesses were insane
02:57:58 <Camail> like holy shit he guessed every defense option right, and guessed every offense option right
02:58:06 <Camail> you can't beat that

03:22:25 <Camail> wtf
03:22:28 <Camail> are you doing
03:24:25 <Camail> YOU KNEW IT WAS A JUMP
03:24:59 <motbob> since SFV is a new game, hundreds of new players will see Marn's run and have it be part of their formative experience
03:26:33 <Camail> those players were gonna suck regardless
03:26:46 <Camail> if you've ever played online you would know it wont change anything
03:27:50 <Camail> I'm more disappointed with du than anything
03:28:09 <Camail> lots of sloppy positioning
03:30:47 <Camail> loooooool
03:38:47 <Camail> justin
03:38:49 <Camail> save america
03:38:58 <Camail> from this Vietnamese devil
03:39:20 <motbob> but we need the vietnamese to save us from the japanese and korean
03:39:59 <Camail> no the korean and the japanese will body the us regardless right now
03:40:17 <Camail> what we cant have is marn eliminating 3 of 4 americans

03:55:39 <motbob> look
03:55:54 <motbob> if you just erase your memory of past events and your knowledge of the game
03:56:04 <motbob> marn magically becomes someone you can root for
03:56:20 <Camail> that takes a lot of effort for me
03:56:22 <motbob> note that that's basically me
03:56:36 <Camail> fuck marn, tho
03:57:54 <Camail> yesssssssss
03:57:57 <Camail> yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
03:58:13 <Camail> a real meaty timing
03:58:17 <Camail> omg marn's face
03:58:20 <Camail> jwong's face
03:58:49 <Camail> YESSSSSSSS
03:59:39 <Camail> ahahahahahaha
04:00:08 <Camail> GTFO HARRY POTTER FUCK
04:00:33 <Camail> AAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
04:01:11 <motbob> it was probably nice that justin had a week of marn practice or w/e
04:01:28 <Camail> its not that
04:01:43 <motbob> i mean yes
04:01:46 <Camail> jwong is using basic month 1 tech
04:01:52 <Camail> that's why we hate marn
04:01:58 <Camail> because ricki and du shouldn't ever lose
04:02:02 <Camail> to this
04:02:09 <Camail> gg
04:03:01 <Camail> every time ricki got a combo he should have had free pressure
04:03:12 <Camail> other than grab, chun gets a meaty jab after
04:04:04 <Camail> which beats everything mika does
04:06:43 <Camail> i wanna see jwong vs infil
04:06:47 <Camail> that would be interesting
04:09:38 <motbob> is being in the corner in SFV worse than in other fighting games?
04:10:18 <Camail> no it's bad in every fighting game
04:10:32 <Camail> takes away half of your space control
04:10:53 <Camail> and also changes the distance you're opponent is pushed away after you block/get hit
04:11:10 <motbob> the second thing is what I noticed
04:11:22 <motbob> i never noticed the pushback in other fighting games
04:11:38 <Camail> the biggest thing is that you can't move out of you're opponents optimal ranges
04:11:45 <Camail> the pushback exists in sf4
04:12:09 <Camail> games treat the corner differently in a lot of little ways
04:12:23 <Camail> wooooow
04:12:26 <Camail> just do it

22:02:46 <Wikt> lol rip
22:03:01 <Wikt> idk i think the arguments probably kinda sound 
22:03:06 <Wikt> but they said they'll change it
22:03:17 <Wikt> maybe the change will be somewhat reasonable
22:03:26 <skram> what argument
22:03:28 <Wikt> i think it's still within her character
22:03:39 <Wikt> the one the OP gave in the sticky where kaplan said they'll change it
22:03:45 <Wikt> that was the whole reason for the discussion
22:03:50 <Wikt> and it turned into SJW vs GG of course
22:03:55 <carcinisation> i'm sure the debate will be reasonable and in proportion
22:04:19 <Wikt> it won't be
