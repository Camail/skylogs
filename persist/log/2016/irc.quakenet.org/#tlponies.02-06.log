00:39:05 <DuB`> Though I haven't had any headphones for 3 days so anything at all sounds like a relief. :P
00:39:26 <skram> whats the sound profile like
00:39:32 <skram> do they make your teeth rattle
00:40:19 <DuB`> My old headphones were known as some of the bass-heaviest around. It'll take some time to get used to not having my head shake at every beat. :P
00:40:38 <DuB`> These are far more even, but still plenty strong (more correct) bass response.
00:41:10 <DuB`> And I feel like I'm hearing more in songs whereas before I just ended up FEELING bass.
00:41:23 <skram> I guess most headsets that arent for studio use tend to be more top and bottom heavy

00:42:39 <DuB`> Bottom HEAVIEST.

01:11:45 <Rawr|Fone> Suuuuuuure
01:12:00 <DuB`> It's also the dumbest name for a group of music genres ever.
01:12:10 <skram> intelligent dance music
01:12:24 <DuB`> "Intelligent Dance Music" is by no means inherently intelligent and is largely un-danceable. 
01:12:26 <DuB`> ...
01:12:32 <DuB`> But it's coolstuff! :D
01:12:50 <skram> Its pretty interesting though

01:29:53 <Camail> in what context
01:29:56 <Camail> normal day?
01:29:59 <DoT`> playing cs go
01:30:07 <Camail> depends ont he player, some have shit habits
01:30:12 <Camail> and are like 4-6 inches
01:30:40 <skram> This is weird as hell, DuB`.
01:30:41 <Camail> but normal might be .5 meters max?
01:30:54 <DuB`> Well, yeah.
01:31:10 <Camail> anywhere from .3 to .5, rarely .6
01:31:23 <Camail> I'm about 18 inches, aka .5 meters
01:31:35 <Camail> i dont ahve contacts in right now so i cant tell for sure
01:31:41 <skram> I dont understand how that has any value as anything else than an excersise in making weird shit.
01:32:11 <DuB`> Hahahahah.
01:32:30 <Camail> things being different for difference's sake is super common
01:32:42 <Camail> I mean, most art int he 20th century
01:32:46 <Camail> literally the modern movement
01:33:00 <Camail> eventually you get to...this
01:33:11 <DoT`> ok, mines at about .6-.7
01:33:26 <Camail> that's fine
01:33:28 <Camail> it doesnt matter
01:33:31 <Camail> whatever makes you comfortable
01:33:32 <DoT`> i was curious becuase i cant see ppl in pit from a site really, they are about a pixel
01:33:34 <Camail> also whats your fps
01:33:54 <Camail> this mgiht also help http://vibrancegui.com/
01:33:56 <DoT`> and coming oput tunnel to back plat
01:34:05 <Camail> turn your brightness up as well
01:34:12 <Camail> turn brightness to max
01:34:17 <Camail> which is .6
01:34:20 <DoT`> oh?  ok
01:34:22 <DuB`> ... I should probably install csgo, huh? :P
01:34:24 <DuB`> Whooooops.
01:34:28 <Camail> dub u fuck
01:34:44 <Camail> also use a crosshair without a dot int he middle
01:34:57 <DoT`> no dot? oh.. well
01:35:01 <skram> D:
01:35:01 <Camail> pit is ahrd to see tho
01:35:03 <DoT`> i actually meant to ask you about that too
01:35:27 <Camail> I use no dot, croshair gap 1, size 3, green, draw outline 1
01:35:29 <Camail> i think
01:35:35 <Camail> classic style
01:35:44 <skram> http://tools.dathost.net/#alpha=200/color=5/color_b=50/color_r=50/color_g=250/dot=0/gap=0/size=5/style=4/usealpha=1/thickness=0.5/outline=0/outline_draw=0
01:36:00 <Camail> ew
01:36:04 <Camail> that looks horrible
01:36:11 <Camail> oh wait
01:36:12 <Camail> it bugged out
01:36:17 <Camail> so that the horizontal lines didnt exist
01:36:20 <Camail> it doesnt look as bad
01:36:24 <Camail> i would still never use it though
01:36:30 <Camail> it also depends on your screen resolution
01:36:43 <Camail> also dot if you get less than 100 fps you need to pay on a lower res
01:36:50 <Camail> not only for visual smoothness
01:36:57 <Camail> but for playability if smokes are out
01:37:06 <Camail> smokes drop your fps by 50 all the time
01:37:17 <DuB`> HuK time!
01:37:25 <Bio> what res to use
01:37:31 <Bio> so many to choose
01:37:51 <skram> whatevers more comfortable and/or gives you enough fps?
01:38:04 <skram> i mean a lot of pros do 4:3 res because of reasons
01:38:08 <DoT`> i dont see the drawoutline option in this skram
01:38:31 <skram> below the gap slider
01:38:35 <skram> press the button
01:38:51 <DoT`> oh
01:38:53 <DoT`> >.>
01:39:02 <ZK> bio, did you make me?
01:39:12 <Camail> skram  being comfortable matters but fps matters so much more, especially at his skill level
01:39:16 <Camail> he isnt comfortable with anytihng yet
01:39:19 <DuB`> ZK: You're a chick.
01:39:22 <DuB`> With a huge pink gun.
01:39:26 <Camail> dildo*
01:39:29 <skram> yes of course
01:39:51 <Camail> DoT`  how much desk space do you have
01:39:57 <Camail> for mouse movement
01:40:07 <Camail> because lowering your sens is also gonna be a thing
01:40:29 <DoT`> my res is lowish, from when we started and you had me set it down
01:41:03 <Camail> res is easy to change, imho, so you do w/e best suits the computer
01:41:15 <skram> DoT` have you enabled console yet
01:41:19 <DoT`> sry, i ment sense
01:41:26 <Camail> err
01:41:26 <DoT`> yes skram
01:41:30 <Camail> do you remember your sens
01:41:33 <Camail> or your mouse dpi
01:41:35 <DoT`> nope
01:41:43 <Camail> those are good things to know
01:42:00 <skram> there are maps designed to figure out what sense you should play on that works ok-ish
01:42:20 <Camail> honestly, when it comes to aim you just need to play more, determine if your are overshooting or undershooting flicks, then change accordingly
01:42:30 <Camail> i kinda think those are bullsiht?
01:42:36 <Camail> like, fi you're bad at aim, you're bad at aim
01:42:48 <Camail> there is no 'right sense' for anyone
01:42:57 <Camail> unless you ahve hpysical issues or injuries
01:43:11 <Camail> this game rewards low sense tho
01:43:20 <DoT`> sense in game is 2
01:43:30 <Camail> because you have greater amrgins of errors and difficulty of shots is reduced by pre aiming
01:43:41 <Camail> do you ahve any idea what  dpi your mouse is
01:43:45 <Camail> what model is it
01:43:51 <DoT`> im looking now
01:43:53 <ZK> oh wow, innovation didnt advance :o
01:44:01 <Camail> ZK  ironic, no?
01:44:08 <skram> worked well enough for me cam
01:44:13 <Camail> thats typically what innovations do
01:44:15 <ZK> well, stork is really pretty good
01:44:22 <Camail> zk is joke
01:44:27 <ZK> zk is obtuse
01:44:35 <Camail> zk is dumb
01:44:41 <ZK> zk is canadian
01:44:47 <skram> its not fuckin rocket science though, its just a starting point and you adjust up or down if you run out of mousepad or have trouble aiming accurately or whatever.
01:44:47 <Camail> zk is redundant
01:44:50 <ZK> poutine week is almost over guys :o
01:44:58 <ZK> aint it sad?
01:45:07 <Camail> make poutine month
01:45:44 <Camail> I mean yea, those tools exist but if you need to adjust anyway there's no difference from jsut picking an aribtrary number in a range
01:45:56 <Camail> the people who learn high sense aiming didnt do it on purpose
01:46:19 <Camail> so its like, the tools encourage a perspective on sens that i disagree with
01:46:29 <Camail> which is why I view them negatively
01:47:02 <skram> its just a way to help make adjustments without playing 40 hours of deathmatch
01:51:26 <Camail> eh, on one hand it doesnt matter and I'm totally fine with it, but on the other, it promotes the concept of a goldilocks sensistivity that fits they way a person currently aims, and that current aim is most likely riddled with bad habits and mistakes. I'm torn between not caring because its just a little tool that inconsiquential over the long run and caring because of what it represents 
01:52:22 <Camail> there is sucha  thing as a sensitivity crisis, I've had one, but what resolved it wasn't my chaning sens, it was changing the way I aimed, fundamentally
01:52:31 <DoT`> well awkward, my mouse seems to be sittign at 2300, it use to be 1600-1800
01:52:35 <Camail> and I'm not convinced I'm special at all
01:52:40 <Camail> ok so
01:52:44 <Camail> 2 at 2300
01:52:55 <Camail> is 12 at 400
01:53:03 <Camail> I'm 2.4 at 400
01:53:07 <Camail> so your sense is fucking insane
01:53:19 <Camail> thats basically unplayable
01:54:24 <DoT`> I was finding it odd today, but it was UNplayable
01:54:37 <Camail> so set it to 1600 first of all
01:54:54 <Camail> and like set your sensitivity to 1
01:55:30 <DuB`> I've seen bad things about the razer software, but I can't do much dpi adjustment without it. I've just been on a mid-default setting. :O
01:55:34 <DoT`> i have just more than 30 cm square of mouse space atm
01:55:40 <DoT`> will it be enough
01:56:05 <Camail> at that sense, yes
01:56:11 <Camail> 100%
01:56:25 <Camail> I use like 40cm and my sense is almost half that
01:56:48 <DuB`> Cam, you're on razer right?
01:57:00 <Camail> DuB`  razer software is fine?
01:57:01 <Camail> er
01:57:03 <Camail> dot
01:57:07 <Camail> tab correct pls
01:57:16 <Camail> i use razer
01:57:19 <Camail> and i have the program
01:57:30 <Camail> its annoying to force dpi settings on a cloud
01:57:33 <Camail> but its usable
01:57:39 <DuB`> Mkay.
01:58:12 <DoT`> i have a razer
01:58:30 <Camail> DoT`  i know I've said this before but to also make sure to set raw_input 1
01:58:38 <Camail> just in caseyou use mouse accel out of game
01:58:41 <Camail> which i dontt hink you do
01:58:43 <Camail> but I do

04:02:21 <Camail> ewww
04:02:23 <Camail> well
04:02:28 <Camail> I mean 9/11 had an internet thing
04:02:40 <Camail> it was the dirty side of the internet tho
04:02:44 <Camail> no fancy aggregater
04:03:00 <Camail> but we got to see what it would probably look like
04:03:31 <Camail> hell, there probably is a subreddit for it right now
04:03:57 <Camail> quesiton is how  different it would look with more people
04:04:17 <Camail> which is actually a potentially interesting question if the answer isn't "exactly the same"

04:28:38 <Dot_> hahaha, fail surround
04:34:51 <motbob> drama in the anime fansubbing community:
04:36:09 <motbob> there was a gentleman being a total moron and antagonizing people. his shtick was to do OCR rips of funimation's hardsubs. Which means, he would run a program to take a video file and spit out a text file that represented the hardcoded subtitles in that video
04:36:38 <motbob> a lot of people got pissed at him for various reasons and reported him to an anti-piracy lawyer group representing funimation
04:36:51 <motbob> this led to a nuclear war of everyone reporting everyone else's twitters
04:37:06 <motbob> now all the fansub twitter accounts I know of are taken down by twitter
04:37:33 <motbob> https://twitter.com/xythar?lang=en this guy protected his twitter to keep it from happening to him ROFL

07:08:08 <motbob> here is a useless piece of information
07:10:58 <motbob> usually when you slow down a song, it loses quality. that's because music files have a "sample rate," usually 44.1 khz. if you were to slow the song down by 50%, it would only be able to use 22.05 khz of samples. But if you render at a higher sample rate you can slow a song down no problem. Turns out that you can render things like chiptunes at high sample rates using 3rd party chiptune players. So if there was ever a song from the N
07:10:59 <motbob> ES or SNES that you ever wanted to hear twice as slow and one octave down, you can hear it in perfect quality!
07:12:55 <Phearlock> nice

13:03:04 <Camail> which is pretty fun
13:03:21 <DoT`> you mastermind you
13:04:00 <Camail> it doesnt take much on smurfs, tbh
13:04:11 <Camail> like a mge going down to silver 5
13:04:31 <Camail> this guy was an mge tho, kept talking trash, I said wihch site iw as going to
13:04:40 <Camail> and really played the asshole
13:08:04 <DoT`> well he asked for it then
13:08:42 <Camail> nah i did a bad thing
13:09:19 <DoT`> yay protoss
13:09:49 <DoT`> well halv wants to play in a bit, hopefull get him further throguh casuals
13:26:53 <Camail> well, amke sure to play together and ideally flash for him
13:27:01 <Camail> his kills matter the most
13:29:27 <Camail> aww i cant watch
13:29:28 <Camail> unfair
13:30:26 <DoT`> :P
13:30:35 <DoT`> getting use to lower sense again
13:33:19 <zkay> lower sense?
13:34:20 <zkay> drogo or hyun?
13:34:58 <DoT`> Drogo!
13:35:03 <DoT`> lower mouse sensitivity
13:35:10 <zkay> ech
13:35:17 <zkay> i cant play with that
13:35:27 <zkay> but pengu told me to play like that
13:35:37 <Camail> we talking csgo
13:36:02 <zkay> omg drogo
13:36:14 <zkay> im sure low mouse sensitivty is same per game
13:36:24 <Camail> eh
13:36:32 <Camail> you dont move your mouse that much in csgo
13:36:39 <Camail> much more in sc2
13:37:03 <zkay> oh ok, yea i  guess, so you wouldnt kill your wrist like in sc2
13:37:15 <Camail> i think higher sens would be good for sc2
13:37:22 <Camail> you dont need to be that accurate
13:37:24 <Camail> comapred to csgo
13:37:48 <zkay> well, hitting individual units is pretty useful
13:37:55 <Camail> yea but even then
13:38:03 <Camail> the target is still big
13:38:07 <Camail> comapred to csgo hitboxes
13:38:10 <zkay> true
13:38:27 <Camail> thats why people in csgo NEED a decently low sensitivity
13:38:43 <Camail> you need to be able to aim efficiently and control spray efficiently
13:38:50 <Camail> so you extend the margin of error
13:39:03 <Camail> but in sc2, clicking a unit is easy compared to that
13:39:08 <zkay> oh right, i forgot about the spray
13:39:12 <Camail> so you can decrease the amrgin for error
13:39:28 <Camail> and give yourself extra speed by sacrificing uneeded accuracy
13:39:57 <Camail> also you ahve more time to micro in sc2 than you do to aim
13:40:14 <Camail> you have maybe 2/5ths of a second 
13:40:55 <Camail> just a lot more mouse precision things in csgo that lean towards lower sensitivity
13:41:06 <Camail> but penguin is pretty good at sc2
13:41:14 <Camail> so i would like to know why he thinks it would be worth it
13:41:16 <Camail> or maybe its just relative
13:41:25 <Camail> maybe a low sense to him is much higher than i expect

14:00:46 <zkay> twi?
14:00:50 <Camail> cane gave me the ones i have
14:00:51 <zkay> i know wikt had logs
14:00:55 <Camail> which are 2013-2016
14:00:57 <zkay> i dunno how far back
14:00:59 <DoT`> Raelcun
14:01:04 <Wikt_> i think i have deleted them
14:01:29 <DoT`> Hey wikt
14:01:33 <Wikt_> i believe i have no more logs laying around
14:01:40 <Wikt_> that would be this old
14:03:37 <zkay> hmm, was worth a try
14:03:39 <DoT`> the list is short of ppl that where always logged on and are the type to keep logs safe that long
14:03:47 <zkay> so only twi left
14:03:52 <zkay> that we can hope for
14:04:29 <zkay> ?zkfanfics
14:04:59 <Camail> that entire year of 2012-2013 was by far the most active
14:05:07 <Camail> wich explains why so many are missing
14:09:02 <DoT`> hmmm
14:09:42 <DoT`> zkay might be right, twi might have them, or original sweetie, whatever happend to her
14:09:47 <Cane> Camail, I should still have them somewhere.
14:10:10 <Camail> this doesnt need to be a priority, but if you happen to find them sometime that would be nice
14:10:14 <Camail> for posterity
14:10:31 <Cane> Found logs from before we had Sweetie.
14:10:33 <Cane> Does that help?
14:10:52 <zkay> a time before sweetie... man thats far away
14:12:19 <Cane> I see Zounds and Lynda and GMarshal and DuB and Gary and Zephirdd and Frek and whoever Jhazrun was.
14:12:30 <Twi> hi i'm alive
14:12:42 <Cane> Bingo.
14:12:52 <Camail> lol cane i just looked at the logs and the conversation we ahve right before the end are eerily similar
14:12:52 <Cane> Found some stuff from 2011.
14:12:56 <DoT`> heyo twi
14:13:00 <Cane> Hahahah
14:13:01 <Cane> I bet.
14:13:03 <Cane> Hi Twi. <3
14:13:11 <Camail> pre sweetie logs are slightly useless
14:13:14 <zkay> hi twi
14:13:25 <Twi> i made a quote site
14:13:26 <zkay> jhazrun... nope no bells
14:13:41 <Twi> https://quotes.greedo.xeserv.us/
14:19:03 <Cane> Found all of the 1.0 Minecraft stuff, so at least I have that.
14:19:45 <Camail> i happened to click to all 4 times where we had this same problem
14:19:48 <Camail> creepy
14:20:04 <Camail> well we talked about it a lot after sweetie 1.0 died

14:21:40 <Camail> i didnt really ahve a technical stake in it until sweete 2
14:21:52 <Camail> which was a big gap
14:23:33 <Camail> ugh the back up server is only payed untilt he end of the month
14:23:44 <Camail> i dont want to re-up it if i dont ahve to
14:23:47 <Cane> I think the logs might be gone.
14:23:51 <Camail> but the good server is being shitty still
14:23:56 <Camail> meh thats fine
14:23:56 <Cane> Sucks, I'm usually good at keeping them but I did have a nasty crash.
14:24:13 <Cane> 2013 is the right time frame.
14:24:40 <DoT`> what kind fo server you need cam? I dont know how it works'
14:25:26 <Camail> its just a bare bones ubuntu vps

14:28:05 <Camail> i just went to the main site, boltvm.com
14:28:09 <Cane> Yeah, chat logs from before 2013 aren't on my external hard drive, so it's unlikely to still exist.
14:28:10 <Camail> and none of the servers are in stock?
14:28:16 <Camail> so like...maybe the company jsut fucking died
14:28:24 <Cane> I'll check some old DVDs this weekend but I won't find anything.
14:28:34 <Camail> meh, whats gone is gone
14:28:45 <zkay> all gone
14:28:46 <Cane> I know, not a big deal, I just want them.
14:29:46 <Cane> I think this was right around the time I lost a year's worth of progress in Diablo 2 single player.
14:29:53 <Cane> 2013, a year of many heartbreaks.
14:30:06 <Camail> lmao
14:30:14 <Camail> ok no the company is liquidated
14:30:21 <Camail> everyone is aying their server died in january
14:30:24 <Cane> lol
14:30:47 <Camail> but they still pay for hosting the site
14:30:51 <Camail> weird
14:31:02 <Cane> Man, do you remember when NationVoice exploded?
14:31:16 <Cane> That was the VoIP thing StarDragon was paying for.
14:31:28 <Cane> Paying for--what a quaint idea now.

14:48:15 <Cane> I keep hearing conflicting things about X-COM 2.
14:48:54 <Cane> Like TB really likes it a lot, but tons of people are complaining about mechanics, timed missions, civilian rescue missions being bugged, etc etc.
14:48:58 <DoT`> ppl on the internet are silly
14:49:02 <Cane> Wondering how much of that is just people being whiny bitches.

14:49:45 <zkay> i think banes might actually work really well
14:51:20 <DoT`> cane, i normaly weigh positive reviews on the internet with far more weight as people will go on the internet to complain as soon as anything doesnt meet what they have in thier head, im sure you find the same
14:51:42 <DoT`> games not perfect, but from what ive seen its well finished off 
14:52:42 <DoT`> ai could use some work :P  i saw a guy want to reset, ran his last guy out into the open between 3 xenos
14:52:58 <DoT`> they spent 2 turns running betwen cover and reloading rather than shoot him
14:53:37 <DoT`> thats the closest ive seen to a bug
