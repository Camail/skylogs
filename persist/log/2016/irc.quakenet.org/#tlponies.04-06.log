22:37:51 <carcinisation> somewhere i have dot picture
22:37:56 <carcinisation> with zk and me
22:38:05 <ZK> i have a few pictures of DoT`
22:38:32 <DoT`> justa few
22:38:43 <Micen> im just curious as to how what I think dot looks like compares to the real thing.
22:39:27 <Camail> dot is a baby
22:39:32 <Camail> a 2 month old baby
22:39:45 <DoT`> i cant even recazll if i had a haircut when i saw zk
22:39:54 <ZK> i dunno
22:39:57 <ZK> you had hair tho
22:40:00 <DoT`> that makes my cs seem not bad cam
22:40:01 <carcinisation> zk was more unlike what i expected him to look like
22:40:19 <ZK> whats that supposed to mean :o
22:40:34 <carcinisation> you were tall
22:40:34 <Camail> no one who saw me at agdq would recognize me now
22:40:46 <Camail> beard + like 6 more inches of hair
22:40:50 <DoT`> there was no berret
22:41:07 <Camail> zk looked exactly like i expected, tbh
22:41:19 <Camail> when i pictured an air-headed asian THAT was it :P
22:41:19 <ZK> thats good?
22:41:29 <ZK> :D
22:41:37 <ZK> oh wait, we had played DnD so you already seen me
22:41:42 <Camail> true
22:41:53 <Camail> its hard to remember the exact order of it all
22:42:12 <Camail> those sessions really didnt happen enough to really get it ingrained in my memory
22:42:27 <ZK> eh, enough that if you saw me you'd think oh yea saw him once
22:42:47 <Camail> though we did get to lvl 3-4 so i suppose we did play a bit
22:42:56 <Camail> 4e is miserable
22:43:01 <Camail> wish we did pathfinder
22:43:17 <Camail> though i really did enjoy my character, glad i could make her
22:43:26 <Camail> and the three other characters i made for failed tlpdnd
22:43:46 <ZK> you made 3 other chars?
22:44:01 <ZK> well, i liked my autistic ranger
22:44:25 <Micen> tlpdnd
22:44:25 <Camail> hmmm, maybe it was two?
22:44:36 <ZK> we made one for scint, one for catties?
22:44:43 <Camail> one for gmarshal's which had one pseudo session
22:44:45 <Micen> This sounds like fun
22:44:47 <Camail> that burned down really fast
22:44:57 <ZK> on right GM's board one died after not even one turn
22:45:03 <Camail> the second was from scint during 3.5e before catties took it over
22:45:19 <Camail> then the third was the flip to 4e
22:45:28 <Camail> i enjoy taking mechanics and making a character out of them
22:45:58 <Camail> but it kinda sucks when the game dies because i get attached tot hem and feel like some f the energy i put into that character goes away forever
22:46:14 <ZK> roleplaying game id like to try is either dungeon world or star wars edge of empire
22:46:27 <Camail> i dont think I'd ever do a sci-fi rpg
22:46:41 <Camail> just not into that visual
22:46:58 <ZK> ive been listening to a podcast of that, and i'd really like to try tit
22:47:05 <Camail> maybe if i could have a sword
22:47:14 <Micen> ZK, if you want a player i would be down
22:47:17 <ZK> yea, you can have a vibro-sword
22:47:17 <Camail> you can try tit if you want zk, but you have to ask her first
22:47:24 <carcinisation> you could play paranoia
22:47:41 <ZK> oh.
22:47:45 <ZK> just realized my spelling
22:47:57 <Camail> shrekt
22:48:01 <Phearlock> We were politely ignoring it
22:48:04 <Camail> i wasnt
22:48:07 <ZK> it's camail
22:49:23 <ZK> legend of the 5 rings also seems cool
22:49:34 <ZK> east-asian culture fantasy world
22:49:36 <DoT`> what you benn watching zk?
22:49:50 <ZK> the podcast? it's called Campaign
22:50:05 <Micen> Thats a ttrpg? I only know 5 rings as a card game
22:50:12 <ZK> yep, same world micen
22:50:21 <Camail> I'd be willing to play another rpg if we had interest, it'd be the same difficulties, especially if we tried doing a global group
22:50:24 <ZK> i like the podcast since it's improvisers so it's really good
22:50:29 <Camail> and the problem is always gonna  be playerbase
22:50:34 <ZK> heh yea.
22:50:35 <Camail> because EVERYONE always want s to play
22:50:50 <ZK> we would  need to have a smaller group of some sort.
22:50:50 <DoT`> being eu is hard
22:50:50 <Camail> even if it was more of a problem when we had 20 active members, it still matters now
22:51:28 <ZK> i mean, interested is me dot Camail reif micen dub
22:51:41 <ZK> bio phear possibly??
22:51:41 <Camail> who would GM
22:51:46 <Camail> thats getting huge
22:51:54 <ZK> Yea, you don't gm that huge
22:52:03 <ZK> max ive GMd is groups of 5
22:52:14 <Camail> 6 is the highest i would go
22:52:19 <Camail> anything else is just too slow
22:52:27 <ZK> 6 players is kinda too much too
22:52:33 <ZK> 6 with GM pretty much
22:52:33 <Camail> especially if we're trying a new system
22:52:54 <ZK> lol if we tried star wars, it would be amazing, but the system can be difficult to grasp
22:53:19 <Camail> I've become competant at learning new gaming systems, but i haven't even glanced at it yet
22:53:32 <Camail> JUST LET ME BE DARTH REVAN AND I'LL DO IT
22:53:40 <Camail> i need to justify my head canon
22:53:49 <Camail> HE'S REAL TO ME, DAMNIT
22:54:01 <carcinisation> reboot time
22:54:04 <ZK> yea, im having fun at looking at them from all over, this one is probably the best i found that has the best player interaction
22:54:07 <Phearlock> He'll say you can't. Then you discover 3/4 of the way through that you actually are.
22:55:07 <DoT`> how sneaky
22:55:19 <ZK> that system is just so good because it's all about creating an amazing story
22:55:28 <ZK> instead of usual pass/fail
22:56:22 <ZK> and DoT`, tell me if you end up listening to podcast :)
22:56:32 <Camail> idc what system it would be honestly, I think they are all good for stories
22:56:48 <Camail> good writers and creative people know how to use results from game mechanics to create a story
22:57:11 <ZK> for sure, but the interaction with users can really be helped by a cool system
22:57:18 <Camail> numbers are just numbers, you provide all of the context anyway, so you can embellish all you want
22:57:27 <Camail> yea you can use the mechanics to reinforce
22:57:30 <ZK> ah you see, this system doesn't have numbers :)
22:57:49 <Camail> yea, and I'm saying that with or without i doesn't actually matter
22:57:51 <ZK> but it does amount to the same
22:58:08 <Camail> it will help new players, i bet
22:58:11 <ZK> for sure

22:58:19 -!- mode/#tlponies [+v reification] by Q
22:58:24 <Camail> though i do recall the shut up and sit down guys talkinga bout this system
22:58:31 <ZK> telling them that they have to create story elements to reinforce instead of just "Well, you hit him, Gjob"
22:58:39 <Camail> and how they kinda liked it but became bored with it? i can't honestly remember
22:58:44 <Camail> but they had a rather subtle opinion
22:58:57 <Camail> so its ahrd to remember the exact mood, but i know for certian the initial impression was very good
23:00:02 <Camail> its just a shame i dont really care about sci-fi
23:00:14 <Camail> i grew up with medieval stuff and .hack//sign
23:00:26 <Camail> never really watched star trek or cared for starwars
23:00:55 <Camail> kotor is great because it hits my "ancient empire unsurfaced" boner
23:01:02 <Micen> when i was like 12 i got the entire TNG series on dvd. Sci-fi is my thing.
23:01:25 <Phearlock> I love awesome machines, so sci-fi is an easy win there.
23:01:29 <ZK> actually, it's the same for me pretty much. Never cared for star trek or star wars
23:01:39 <ZK> only watched star wars for the first time 4-5 years ago
23:01:42 <Phearlock> And semi-realistic technobabble is super fun xD
23:01:43 <ZK> about when i joined TLP
23:02:30 <Emily_zzz> gnite pones!
23:03:10 <Micen> Good night!
23:03:12 <Camail> maaaan I'm never gonna be able to play my drunkard dual wielding pirate cleric

23:03:17 <DoT`> gnight homm!
23:03:25 <Camail> first thing i did in scint's campaign is get us kicked out of a bar
23:03:38 <ZK> eh, i would also do another fantasy one with dungeon world.
23:03:42 <ZK> But i have too many world i wanna try
23:04:00 <Phearlock> My favorite sci-fi moment recently was using a heliostat (giant mirror satellite to provide sunlight to crops 24/7) as a giant solar beam death ray.
23:04:02 <ZK> basically dont want DnD is my only thing atm
23:04:12 <Phearlock> Well, I didn't, happened in some pony fanfiction.
23:04:18 <Phearlock> But it was awesome
23:04:40 <ZK> haha
23:05:25 <Micen> sounds like it!
23:05:54 <Micen> I kinda want to try something in a cyberpunk setting.
