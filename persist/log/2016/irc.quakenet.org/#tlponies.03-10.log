01:29:17 <Phearlaptop> ?hug
01:29:26 <Phearlaptop> thank you sweetie
01:30:03 <DuB`> I have trouble.
01:30:11 <DoT`> oh dear dubs

01:30:22 <Bio> i am plej wow
01:30:25 <Bio> and pizza
01:30:31 <DuB`> The tests for this class are always much more difficult/involved than all of the textbook and inclass content we do, to force us to stretch.
01:30:32 <DuB`> But.
01:30:40 <DuB`> That makes them reaaally hard to study/prepare for.
01:30:56 <DoT`> that sounds normal
01:31:08 <DoT`> maji
01:31:14 <DuB`> I dun even know what to do!
01:31:18 <DoT`> a problem is when your leg drops off
01:31:20 <DuB`> More than normal, dawt!
01:31:57 <DoT`> actually a leg dropping off might be a bother but no worse
01:32:05 <DoT`> what you have is an annoyance
01:32:18 <DuB`> What if it's a very important test.
01:33:15 <DoT`> then its a nuisance
01:35:01 <DuB`> Hm.
01:35:26 <DuB`> Bio how many wowbossthings have you done?
01:35:42 <DuB`> Dunno if I ever saw you beat purplegreen firedude.
01:36:27 <Bio> we beat fire dude 2 times
01:36:33 <Bio> now we on giant demon guy
01:36:52 <Bio> the second to last boss before gianter demon boss guy
01:37:04 <DuB`> I see.
01:39:33 <DuB`> Don't forget to doroppu za beeto.
01:43:41 <Phearlaptop> They actualyl had some bass (the fish) at the store recently, pretty rare aroud town so.
01:43:52 <Phearlaptop> I made sure to pick it up and drop it while making quiet wub noises.
01:43:58 <Phearlaptop> Simple fun
01:44:01 <Phearlaptop> Was a good day
01:44:08 <DuB`> Well done. 
01:44:19 <DuB`> Hahahah.
01:44:24 <skrma> is that abbor ferlok
01:45:07 <DuB`> Abbor seems to be a European Perch, skarm.
01:47:15 <Phearlaptop> I am not good with fish skram
01:47:33 <skrma> havabbor is a bass apparantly dub
01:47:44 <DuB`> Ok.
01:48:16 <DuB`> I could tell you more fish names in japanese than in english.
01:48:58 <skrma> they are entirely different species
01:49:00 <skrma> stupid language
01:49:57 <DuB`> Wat.
01:50:04 <Phearlaptop> Yes lol
01:50:16 <Phearlaptop> I did some searching too
01:50:37 <Phearlaptop> havabbor (ocean-abbor basically) and abbor are pretty much not the same fish
01:50:52 <Phearlaptop> Or like, close to being the same fish
01:51:20 <skrma> that guy who decided the name saw one fish and thought it looked like that other fish he saw that also lived in the ocean
01:51:40 <Phearlaptop> Wikipedia says the source of this is from 1792 skram
01:51:50 <Phearlaptop> this was before we invented oil and became smart.
01:52:57 <Phearlaptop> We should ask CR or Rawr if sweden is smarter at fish
01:53:11 <Phearlaptop> And runbunny! I wanna compare now
01:53:26 <skrma> what an odd dick measuring contest
01:53:35 <Phearlaptop> "who is worst at naming fish"

02:35:06 <DuB`> I'll only have contact with a small portion of the class before the test, unfortunately.
02:36:26 <Camail> i guess
02:36:29 <Camail> just git gud
02:36:56 <Camail> if you cant study for it then the best you can do is be calm so you dont fuck up things more than you have to
02:37:40 <DuB`> Yah.
02:38:49 <DuB`> It's all about combining concepts/processes that we've never really put together before, while not missing any of the tricky nuances involved in all of them.
02:39:19 <DuB`> It's actually kinda fun in a challenging puzzley kind of way.
