10:20:12 <Micen> is that many?
10:42:43 <DoT`> NO
10:42:50 <DoT`> you need 300 parsnips
10:43:03 <DoT`> drown them in parsnips

18:03:30 <skram> and also other people
18:04:03 <DoT`> other ppl?!
18:04:05 <DoT`> rude
18:04:46 <skram> Yolteotl, what does comptine d'un autre ete, l'apres-midi mean
18:05:04 <Micen|Droid> Hai Skram
18:05:15 <skram> i may have missed some `_^`?\`\+\-es
18:05:26 <DoT`> skram, probably "i eat frogs and ponies"
18:05:37 <DuB`> Mmmmm horsemeat.
18:05:39 <skram> mm yes
18:05:53 <DoT`> i forget you are all heathens
18:06:00 <DuB`> DoT`:
18:06:01 <DuB`> Raw.
18:06:02 <DuB`> Horse.
18:06:03 <DuB`> Heart.
18:06:04 <skram> I ate some horse this morning with my cow juice
18:06:07 <skram> Very tasteful.
18:06:10 <Yolteotl> song of another summer, the afternoon ?
18:06:37 <skram> I dont know? Im asking you, silly.
18:06:43 <DoT`> you all need to be more british, eating horses is bad
18:06:45 <Yolteotl> it's this
18:06:53 <skram> Its from the Amelie soundtrack so that makes sense
18:07:04 <Yolteotl> amelie?
18:07:30 <skram> la fabuleux destin d'Amelie
18:07:33 <skram> The movie?
18:07:37 <Yolteotl> ah :d
18:07:43 <Yolteotl> I did not watch it
18:07:47 <ZK> i didnlt like the movie
18:08:01 <ZK> or maybe its cause i watched it in ethics class
18:08:04 <skram> Love that movie. Soundtrack is excellent too.
18:08:34 <Yolteotl> french movies are different :d
18:09:02 <DoT`> like the french
18:09:07 <skram> Dunno, french movies seem to be kinda slice-of-lifey
18:09:19 <Camail> or very, very not
18:09:25 <Camail> no in between
18:09:36 <ZK> tanguy was weird
18:09:44 <DuB`> Oh look a caimal.
18:09:49 <Camail> shut ur face
18:09:51 <Camail> or fight
18:09:58 * Camail  punches dub in the dick
18:09:58 <ZK> is tanguy a real name?
18:10:10 <skram> I think ive only seen like 4
18:12:31 <Yolteotl> My favorite french movie is
18:12:45 <Yolteotl> Love me if you dare
18:12:57 <Yolteotl> with Guillaume Canet and Marion Cotillard :d
18:13:49 <skram> did she play in la vie en rose?
18:13:54 <Yolteotl> yep
18:14:02 <Yolteotl> and batman 
18:14:02 <Yolteotl> :P
18:14:06 <ZK> la vie en rose, thats an old song
18:14:11 <Yolteotl> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtzjUjVQe9Q
18:15:13 <Yolteotl> la vie en rose is the main songg of this movie too :D
18:16:00 <skram> well it is a love song
18:16:02 <skram> i think
18:16:10 <Yolteotl> it is
18:16:18 <Yolteotl> o
18:16:19 <Yolteotl> oh
18:16:20 <Yolteotl> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfqPmTxD-IY
18:16:22 <Yolteotl> full movie :d
18:17:33 <skram> i watched the hateful eight last night
18:17:36 <skram> it was kinda meh
18:18:31 <Yolteotl> I don't like Tarantino :p
18:19:04 <skram> I do like tarantino, but it was kinda boring
18:19:34 <skram> its like 3 hours long and there is probably 2 hours and 30 minutes of dialog
18:19:44 <skram> and another 30 minutes of silly closeups and wacky camera angles
18:21:57 <Yolteotl> and if you want another awesome french movie, we are also very good at depressing movies. You can watch "Don't worry, I'm fine" :D
18:22:27 <Yolteotl> with Melanie Laurent
18:23:28 <skram> I cant find it on imdb D:
18:24:10 <Yolteotl> hmm
18:24:22 <Yolteotl> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485241/
18:25:06 <skram> imma torrent it and go make some dinner
18:26:24 <carcinisation> depressing is one of the adjectives least likely to make me watch a film
18:27:11 <DuB`> Movies are for enjoyment!
18:27:13 <DuB`> Sad is not happy!
18:27:20 <carcinisation> amelie was a nice french film
18:28:53 <Camail> DuB`  sad movies are for middle class white girls who like crying
18:29:20 <Camail> or anyone who doesn't have anything  to be sad about
18:30:23 <Runbunny> Sounds like you Camail.

19:27:17 <Camail> how do you have 2g
19:27:19 <Camail> how
19:27:51 <Camail> they really need to make animals more profitable
19:28:29 <DoT|Phone1> they did
19:28:37 <DoT|Phone1> don't know how much
19:28:38 <Camail> there is no incentive to have animals after you get the CC bundles
19:28:49 <Camail> yea but like...never enough
19:29:33 <Camail> pigs cost 16k , they take a whole season to make a profit
19:29:50 <DoT|Phone1> but also. Who would pick Elliot
19:29:57 <Camail> yea he's easily the worst
19:30:14 <Camail> like...not gonna lie the writing in this game is bad
19:30:17 <Camail> but elliot is just awful
19:32:41 <ZK> what are cc bundles?
19:34:02 <DoT|Phone1> community center
19:34:45 <ZK> ohhh, you can still get those after your first collection?
19:37:42 <Camail> DoT|Phone1  apaprently the skull cavern walls have a cipher that people translated
19:37:54 <Camail> no zk
19:38:03 <Camail> but if you want to get them at all you need to get animals at least once
19:38:09 <Camail> I immediately sold most of mine
19:38:14 <Camail> other than the fun ones and the pigs
19:38:23 <Camail> though i should sell those too if i ever play on that save again
19:45:19 <carcinisation> i played a new type of poker called 6+ as part of a promo
19:45:32 <DoT|Phone1> you gm?
19:45:34 <carcinisation> playing a game where the hand rankings and odds are different
19:45:40 <carcinisation> and it's short handed
19:45:52 <carcinisation> oh and way above my usual stakes
19:46:06 <carcinisation> it's a bit stressful
19:46:25 <carcinisation> dot, i lost half a stack then won it back
19:47:17 <carcinisation> now i've played enough for my free shot at 1000 euros on tuesday
19:48:07 <skram> But what are you gonna do with euros in england? they are the wrong monies!
