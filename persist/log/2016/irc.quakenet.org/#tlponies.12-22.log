18:16:31 <Bio> hmm
18:16:33 <Camail> i thought this arc would be the final one, but I'm not so sure now
18:16:52 <Camail> turns out mercer really likes playing with big toys
18:17:08 <Bio> are they getting to the point where they aren't getting challenged as much? or are the players just getting gud
18:17:25 <Camail> he's been modding monsters for months now
18:17:42 <Camail> they will never git gud, they aren't minmaxing at all
18:17:45 <Camail> and likely never will
18:18:10 <Bio> gotcha
18:20:09 <Camail> they kinda minmaxed for this last fight because they really didnt want to die
18:20:31 <Camail> but there's still plenty of stuff to do for VM

18:50:36 <Bio> lunch
18:50:39 <Camail> i would've one 3 days ago
18:50:49 <Camail> though my internet still hates livestreaming
18:51:11 <Camail> my speed tests are good e-penis material, but practically still kinda shit
18:51:15 <Dot`> here i am one 1 screen
18:51:24 <Dot`> that sucks cam
18:51:36 <Camail> at least its better
18:52:01 <Camail> i can watch 1080 videos, at least
18:52:12 <Camail> just twitch seems to be the problem
18:57:04 <motbob> i haven't had systematic buffering problems on major sites for at least a year
18:57:42 <motbob> three years ago the internet in general was total shit for me. Youtube, Twitch, etc... no matter how low I turned the resolution, it buffered
18:58:27 <motbob> i haven't noticed that at all. I guess netflix stopped clogging the tubes so much. Or they built bigger tubes.
18:59:14 <Bio> the internet is not a big truck
18:59:20 <Camail> or tyhe ISPs let them buy bigger tubes
18:59:44 <Camail> TW and comcast are known to hold random on netflix 
19:00:16 <Camail> my guess is google payed the fees and twitch didnt for verizon in my area
19:00:18 <Camail> or something
19:01:10 <Camail> because i just tested for 40 down while watching a 1080p youtube video, I really REALLY shouldn't have trouble doing a 2.5kbps twitch steram
19:01:24 <Camail> like, say what you want about how steramlined testst data is...thats a margin
19:03:23 <Dot`> lol probe, so many nice disrupter shots
19:06:27 <motbob> "hold ransom on comcast" or force them to pay their share of the network load
19:06:45 <motbob> "on netflix"*

23:39:42 <Rawr|Fone> I beat the elite four and then there was a 40 minute credits sequence
23:40:19 <Dot`> sounds like a good reward rawr
23:40:30 <Rawr|Fone> It was nice
23:41:07 <Dot`> was it a good game?
23:43:01 <Rawr|Fone> I think it was pretty meh
23:43:25 <Rawr|Fone> Pokemon games are very linear, but this one was extremely linear
23:44:00 <Rawr|Fone> You had a flag on the minimap, you went to the flag and a cutscene played and you got a new flag to walk to
23:44:08 <Rawr|Fone> That was the whole game
23:44:40 <Rawr|Fone> I didn't lose a single trainer battle, because my pokemon got super overleveled 
23:44:48 <Rawr|Fone> Even without xp share on
23:45:14 <Dot`> :/
23:45:19 <Rawr|Fone> No puzzles or secret areas either
23:45:33 <Dot`> thats a bit dissapointing
23:46:22 <Rawr|Fone> I liked some of the things they did though
23:46:29 <Rawr|Fone> Like getting rid of hms
23:47:11 <Rawr|Fone> It was still a pokemon game though
23:47:17 <Rawr|Fone> It was enjoyable
23:49:10 <Rawr|Fone> I expect there is some end game content too
