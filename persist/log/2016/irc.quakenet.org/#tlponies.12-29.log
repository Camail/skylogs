00:19:12 <DuB`> I might do the whole Endless Legends pack for $30 instead of steep for $40.
00:19:32 <DuB`> It's a bit less of a game I can just play for 20 minutes when I'm busy with school, but it looks so gooood.
00:26:15 <skram> quit school and help me become grandmaster
00:27:05 <DoT|Phone> it's a worthy goal
00:31:04 <DuB`> I'mma just get a nice job in 2 years and BUY a gm account. ;D

00:31:28 <DuB`> Comes with the perk of actually being able to buy christmas presents for people, too.

00:33:56 <DoT|Phone> but the story and art of that game are so great
00:34:00 <DuB`> Yes.
00:34:50 <DuB`> After wanting to break my laptop when  playing meatboy 4 years ago I swore off platformers. :P
00:34:57 <DuB`> I will break that vow for Ori only!

21:28:57 <DuB`> That was incredible.
21:34:36 <Bio> that was a meme and a half
21:37:29 <Bio> So a big change that's planned for the scoreboard is that you can now see who is playing worse on your team, so that you can very politely tell the person, you know, "Hey dude, maybe you should choke on my Lijiang Tower and then fucking kill yourself." So that should be a lot better.

23:38:30 <Camail> i would watch a last guardian speedrun 
23:38:41 <Camail> as long as they dont cutscene skip
23:39:09 <Camail> also if they could get the run to sub 4h
23:39:46 <Camail> oh its already at 4:30 so that shouldn't be an issue
23:41:15 <Dot`> with no cutscene skip?
23:42:20 <Camail> i dont think you can skip them
23:42:23 <Camail> which is great
23:42:34 <Camail> and i seriously doubt they can glitch a ctuscene skip
23:43:09 <Camail> that requires extensive knowledge about the cutscene triggers and other glitches to avoid them but still trigger progression triggers
23:43:11 <Camail> vaguely
23:47:05 <Dot`> cool
23:51:26 <Yolteotl> The last guardian is awesome!
