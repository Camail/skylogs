01:06:04 <Crisium> street fighter v beta, or: do you know this is a frametrap? time to guess what's plus on block
01:11:19 <Crisium> ya i think at least early on the best characters will be those with plus buttons
01:15:56 -!- BioClass [~Bio@108-72-10-1.lightspeed.stlsmo.sbcglobal.net] has joined #tlponies
01:19:00 <Camail> karin is such a bitch
01:19:04 <Camail> her frame traps
01:19:08 <Camail> are dumb
01:19:29 <Crisium> agree
01:19:39 <Runbunny> best character.
01:21:33 <Crisium> mika and bison also have good plus button
01:22:39 <Crisium> vega vs zangief fun matchup
01:22:40 <Camail> i need to learn mika
01:22:45 <Camail> but only whent he game comes out
01:22:50 <Camail> chun is easy to learn
01:22:56 <Crisium> chun vs vega is fun too
01:22:58 <Camail> super good neutral game
01:23:03 <Camail> her anti airs are so bad i hurts tho
01:23:18 <Camail> but if you can get them the other guy is DONE
01:23:54 <Camail> gief is fucking annoying
01:24:06 <Camail> the gief chun match up is looking not so great
01:24:13 <Camail> its certainly not in chun's favor
01:24:29 <Camail> i need to take a break
01:24:37 <Camail> i dont wanna got below 1000 points, as well >_>
01:24:47 <Crisium> beta has a few hours left lol
01:24:49 <Crisium> pts dont matter
01:25:06 <Camail> I'm palying better than i thogut i would, considering i ahvent taken a fighting game really seriously for well voer a year now
01:25:18 <Camail> pts matter because below 1000 is a bunch of idiots wasting my time
01:25:33 <Crisium> oh lol
01:25:42 <Camail> if i ahve to face one more ken that DPs after a failed tatsu I'm gonna kill myself
01:25:52 <Crisium> ya iv only fought good players today cause iv been abpove 100
01:25:54 <Crisium> 1000*
01:26:10 <Camail> also
01:26:13 <Camail> crossups on wake up
01:26:15 <Camail> are so strong
01:26:22 <Camail> because reversal dont hit behind
01:26:23 <Camail> like, ever
01:26:30 <Camail> and if they do its only one hit
01:26:38 <Camail> thats one good thing chun has
01:26:46 <Camail> for meter she can make you gtfo if you jump
01:27:17 <Camail> it costs so much, but i resets neutral and gives you the advantage if you fireball
01:27:29 <Camail> also i just found her overhead like 20 minutes ago
01:27:31 <Camail> its so weird
01:27:38 <Crisium> ok fuck this game
01:27:49 <Crisium> just played a rashid that spammed light tornado
01:27:50 <Camail> k
01:27:52 <Crisium> now THAT is safe as fuck
01:27:56 <Crisium> AS FUCK
01:28:05 <Camail> yea but it goes up
01:28:15 <Crisium> i dont mean projectile
01:28:24 <Crisium> whatever the other one is called
01:28:25 <Camail> I bet you 1000 buck you can slide under it to get closer to him
01:28:31 <Camail> oh
01:28:33 <Camail> like the cody thing?
01:28:35 <Crisium> where he physically spins
01:28:43 <Camail> i only faced one rashid
01:28:44 <Camail> and he suckes
01:28:46 <Camail> d*
01:28:47 <Crisium> im not sure what vega could do
01:28:55 <Crisium> i have nothing with invincibilty
01:28:56 <Camail> hit him with your giant normals
01:29:02 <Camail> thats how vega solves problems
01:29:03 <Camail> all of them
01:29:07 <Crisium> its an upclose move
01:29:11 <Camail> block?
01:29:16 <Crisium> its plus on block
01:29:19 <Camail> ok
01:29:21 <Crisium> doesnt knock down, doesnt push back
01:29:23 <Camail> so then block the next thing
01:29:25 <Crisium> he stays in your face
01:29:28 <Camail> defense exists
01:29:30 <Crisium> he can keep doing it
01:29:31 <Crisium> forever
01:29:41 <Camail> i doubt that
01:30:11 <Camail> use your new DP
01:30:18 <Crisium> ??
01:30:21 <Camail> the motion
01:30:24 <Crisium> ??
01:30:30 <Camail> vegas dp
01:30:33 <Crisium> ???
01:30:34 <Camail> whats the ?? about
01:30:38 <Camail> just fuckin reversal
01:30:44 <Crisium> what
01:30:45 <Camail> its literally a part of every fighting game ever
01:30:45 <Crisium> what dp
01:30:57 <Camail> every game with assists has 1000 more problems to deal with than that moves
01:31:06 <Camail> did they removed his flash kick?
01:31:10 <Crisium> yes
01:31:12 <Camail> haha
01:31:19 <Camail> well then block like a real boy
01:31:23 <Crisium> dude i did
01:31:28 <Crisium> 3 teams in a row then he throws me
01:31:30 <Camail> i know!
01:31:37 <Camail> ok then tada, you're out
01:31:58 <Crisium> i think all i could do is the V Reversal thing that pushes back for V meter
01:32:06 <Camail> thats a possibility
01:32:13 <Camail> it probably jsut straight up counters
01:32:16 <Crisium> or MAYBE vegas v skill which does have SOME invincibility
01:32:25 <Camail> do you ahve any reversals at all?
01:32:35 <Crisium> no
01:32:52 <Crisium> only move with any kinda invincibility is v skill
01:32:52 <Camail> trowing you is good tho
01:33:00 <Camail> because he resets neutral and you are way better in neutral
01:33:13 <Crisium> yeah true
01:33:17 <Camail> anyway I'm hungry as fuck, need to find food
01:35:36 <Crisium> now im playing the laggies player in the world
01:36:15 <Runbunny> I had a match which didn't lag :D
01:36:21 <Crisium> what a disgusting human being
01:36:23 <Runbunny> and I still lost because bad.
01:36:23 <DoT`> luxury
01:36:30 <Crisium> who can possibly have a 5 connection to me and lag that bad
01:36:33 <Crisium> terrible
01:36:40 <Runbunny> Indeed Dot.
01:36:48 <Crisium> truly a horrible person to play when his internet is like this
01:36:54 <ZK> BioClass, John Scott is NHL all-star MVP
01:36:55 <ZK> lol
01:37:11 <Crisium> of course
01:37:12 <Runbunny> I had a 100 LP but I lost them all again :/
01:38:31 <Runbunny> The map thingy in the background has my local time wrong :/
01:38:57 <DoT`> rude
01:39:29 <Runbunny> I just pretend to be in your cage Dot. Then the clock would be correct.
01:39:45 <Crisium> ya karin is the most annoying character for sure
01:39:54 <DoT`> its yours angel, we give it to you
01:40:29 <Camail> Runbunny  did you set it to pc only and 5 only
01:40:34 <Runbunny> nope
01:40:37 <Camail> do that
01:40:41 <Camail> in entwork settings
01:40:43 <Crisium> ya do it
01:40:51 <Camail> or at least 4-5
01:40:56 <Runbunny> but then it will take me even longer to find a match
01:40:59 <Runbunny> I did 4-5
01:40:59 <Crisium> its much better now, altho some assholes still sneak thru with their soviet internet
01:41:08 <Camail> thats fine roon
01:41:11 <Camail> you get trianing room

02:56:17 <Crisium> i have this and its OK, but i could do better http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKLFES8
03:02:23 <motbob> in the end, the NHL came out way ahead here. Look at all this publicity!
03:03:36 <ZK> definitely, all the controversy made all the fans and players band behind john scott
03:04:45 <BioSC> though man, the 3v3 allstar game was waaaay better than last years 5v5
03:04:48 <BioSC> hope they keep that
03:06:01 <ZK> i hope they keep the voting
03:06:13 <ZK> so next year we can have 4 captains that have no place there

03:14:53 <Camail> motbob doesnt it kidna depend on what you mean by nhl, the organization seems to ahve gotten a lot of bad press
03:15:11 <Camail> and I'm not convinced that all publicity is good publicity
03:15:15 <motbob> mmm
03:15:28 <Camail> but like
03:15:31 <Camail> the teams and the palyers yea
03:15:31 <motbob> let's imagine the issue that brings publicity is match-fixing
03:15:34 <Camail> really good for them
03:15:38 <motbob> that's purely negative
03:15:46 <Camail> aka sc2 right now?
03:16:02 <motbob> the integrity of the league is comprimised, the games are less enjoyable to watch
03:16:34 <motbob> that's an example of publicity being bad publicity... but look at all the positive emotion being generated by this. Positive emotion associated with hockey.
03:16:42 <Camail> positive towards whom
03:16:47 <Camail> towards the people supporting scott
03:16:48 <motbob> towards The Game
03:16:55 <Camail> outwardly negative towards the league itself
03:17:21 <ZK> still good for hockey
03:18:04 <Camail> I love the story, but it definately hurts the people who made the decisions
03:18:08 <Camail> which is good
03:18:10 <Camail> cuz fuck those guys
03:18:17 <ZK> http://www.theplayerstribune.com/a-guy-like-me/
03:18:32 <ZK> that story might sink him with the nhl, but brought all hockey fans to him
03:18:33 <Camail> i know
03:18:55 <Camail> if he never makes it out of the minors he's gonna get lost
03:19:05 <Camail> I hope that doesn't happen
03:19:13 <ZK> he's gonna have to fall back on his engineering degree
03:19:37 <Camail> we still need to see the fallout from the all start game
03:19:48 <Camail> who knows
03:20:06 <ZK> hes probably gonna stay in the minors of my team for the rest of the season
03:20:06 <Crisium> doesnt montreal have room on their 4th line? :(
03:20:17 <Camail> and really old degrees arent as strong as you might think
03:20:34 <Camail> he's 33 now, how old is that degree
03:20:41 <Camail> how much does he actually remember
03:20:51 <Camail> i hope someone picks him up
03:21:13 <Camail> either way, probably wont go back to engineering

03:21:57 <Camail> that was a guess i had, or maybe he'll take something else sports related

03:54:52 <DoT|Phone1> gnight all
03:58:17 <Camail> no
04:00:48 <Crisium> good night dote
04:28:03 <Micen> hello
04:31:12 <Crisium> hi
04:34:52 -!- Micen_ [~Micen@h20.49.55.139.dynamic.ip.windstream.net] has joined #tlponies
04:34:56 <Micen_> What you up to Crisium?
04:36:12 <Camail> not palying sf5
04:36:19 <Camail> because he a bitch
04:36:58 <Camail> Crisium i almost ended the beta on a loss so i played a few mroe and won then just left
04:37:10 <Camail> if i dont taste sf5 until launch i dont want the aftertaste to be salty
04:37:12 <Crisium> i ended on a 5 game winstreak for a reason
04:37:14 <Crisium> lol
04:37:30 <Camail> the match making hung up and i thought it was over
04:37:33 <Camail> but my game jsut bugged out
04:37:37 <Camail> it felt so bad
04:37:48 <Camail> it was a close game with a laura and i have 0 idea how to fight her
04:37:56 <Camail> s.hp seems pretty good
04:38:19 <Crisium> im super clueless about everything, mostly i try to test everyone's buttons on block to see who has + lol
04:38:41 <Camail> i didnt even try to figure anything like that out
04:38:45 <Camail> not enough time
04:38:54 <Camail> i jsut went with footsies and the occasional combo
04:39:07 <Camail> i actually did a crush counter combo, so i was super hype
04:39:19 <Camail> i didnt finish it, but i did two parts of it
04:39:27 <Crisium> vega has a really good crush counter anti air with meter
04:39:45 <Camail> isnt cruch counter int he air useless?
04:39:47 <Crisium> s.hk into EX FBA and then you can finish with V Trigger
04:39:47 <Camail> they just spin out
04:39:50 <Camail> oh right
04:39:52 <Camail> air stuff
04:40:13 <Camail> maybe chun can do something with her v skill
04:41:15 <Camail> the best part about sf5 so far is the way jump ins work
04:42:02 <Camail> a lot less hit stun
04:49:56 <BioSC> nn horses
04:50:12 <BioSleep> nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
04:50:35 <Crisium> nn
04:51:51 <Camail> crissss wanna shoot? I'm pretty sure I'm like 100% done with sf4
04:51:54 <Camail> sf5 is so pretty
04:54:15 <Crisium> not in a good condition for shoots
04:54:22 <Crisium> also im not even in a league
04:55:13 <Crisium> we'd have to do casuals lol
04:55:29 <Crisium> which is like 10v10 or such nonsense

22:01:40 <Yolteotl> that Kespa president as to do official stuff to say they can't do lot of stuff againt this. It looks like a big issue for Korea :/
22:01:46 <Yolteotl> *has
22:01:59 <DoT`> no, im not bothering to read all the drama till ppl actually know whats happening
22:02:47 <Yolteotl> it is very bad for Sc2 in Korea
22:02:51 <DoT`> there is no threat at all to the scene from this, it happens in sport and it sucks
22:03:02 <DoT`> it might hurt but they get over it
22:03:20 <DoT`> im going to enjoy this wcs change news
22:03:22 <Yolteotl> if SKT doesn't follow Sc2
22:03:30 <Yolteotl> it will be a huge issue
22:04:10 <DoT`> yea, and sc2 would be nothing this year if blizzard wasnt throwing money at it, but oh well
22:04:21 <DoT`> just have to wait and see
22:08:54 <Yolteotl> and play starcraft!
22:08:55 <Yolteotl> snela :p
22:09:14 <DoT`> well you need top 16
22:10:49 <Yolteotl> THEN. As bunny says on Twitter. Top 16 is kind of weird
22:11:31 <Yolteotl> it's something that change almost every day, some pro gamers are blocked in top master because no more place in GM
22:11:40 <DoT`> aaannnd you find the one person not happy
22:12:11 <DoT`> there are other ways to qualify as far as im aware
22:14:57 <Yolteotl> yes of course, but that doesn't mean that some can be well thought, balanced and smart and one be dumb :P  Imagine if I got a little better, and get GM!
22:15:21 <Yolteotl> Then Nerchio or Lilbow were lazy too play first days and did not access to GM
22:15:34 <Yolteotl> that would not be fair.
22:16:13 <DoT`> lilbow is really bad right now
22:16:18 <DoT`> as far as pros go
