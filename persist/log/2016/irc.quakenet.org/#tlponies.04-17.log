10:59:45 <reification> actually i saw there are cheap flights to canada via iceland/murica
10:59:49 <reification> is tempting
11:00:33 <DoT`> by cheap you mean like 10 pounds? because then i will go
11:02:29 <reification> maybe visiting yolo or skram is closer to your budget
11:02:49 <ZK> can you get there for 10 pounds?
11:02:56 <reification> i said closer
11:03:02 <ZK> oh yea
11:03:13 <ZK> cause does 10 pounds even coverthe fare to get to the airport?
11:03:21 <Micen> You could come to kentucky and visit ZK. 
11:03:31 <reification> megabus can get me to france for about £10
11:03:34 <ZK> you stil offer lots of donuts?
11:03:51 <Micen> i would have to buy them, but i mean i guess. 
11:04:02 <Micen> its like 50 cents a donut
11:04:09 <ZK> well last time we talked, you said I'd get a lot of krispy kreme donuts
11:04:24 <ZK> i think you were working there back then, right?
11:04:32 <Micen> i was working at a local shop
11:04:36 <Micen> not a big chain
11:05:03 <Micen> and they are cheap so I could buy a bunch.
11:05:31 <ZK> do they taste better than krispy kreme?
11:05:37 <Micen> Yes
11:06:03 <reification> i can get train to london gatwick airport for £5 zk
11:06:17 <ZK> so, 5 pound flight for DoT` :P
11:06:40 <reification> so he’s not coming back :p
11:06:53 <ZK> i even doubt that plane can leave the ground
11:07:01 <ZK> it's probly more a skateboard
11:07:05 <ZK> those really cheap ones though
11:08:38 <Micen> Montreal isnt all too far of a drive... ive considered driving, or taking a bus farther. 
11:09:26 <DoT`> LOL, i tihnk i cut and paste my documents folder instead of copy/paste when i was backing up 2 days ago
11:11:15 <Phearlock> lol

11:15:08 <Phearlock> Could be worse!
11:15:13 <Phearlock> You could have lost the backup

18:48:54 <DoT`> he is so far
18:50:13 <Halvgud> ABcamper you mean? He just hid in the center of circle and waiting for a good placement.
18:50:42 <Halvgud> Smurf with the marathon medal this round
18:50:47 <DoT`> why is he playing unamrmed? lol
18:51:03 <Halvgud> dropped in the mountains
18:51:12 <Halvgud> too far from buildings
18:51:17 <Rawr|Phone> Beep beep
18:51:21 <Halvgud> Guess he just took his chances and lucked out
18:51:34 <DoT`> ah, i tohught he might be some odd joke player
18:51:55 <Halvgud> He does not have the skrott30 vibe
18:52:22 <Halvgud> Smurf making the circle lol
18:52:58 <Halvgud> he must have used all the boosts and medkits for that
18:53:19 <DoT`> hhaha
18:53:38 <DoT`> wtf nutty
18:54:36 <Halvgud> if nutty gets a car and manages to get inside, I will be very impressed
18:54:58 <DoT`> or just keeps medded all game form looting
18:55:13 <Rawr|Phone> Street fighter is very fun game
18:55:29 <Halvgud> oh god the amount of medkits he will need
18:55:34 <DoT`> your fun rawr
18:55:51 <Rawr|Phone> No you
18:56:23 <DoT`> i tihnk the lack of overwatch has killed dub
18:56:46 <DoT`> break just chilling all game
18:56:53 <skram> He is listening to Enya while crying DoT`.
18:57:54 <Halvgud> I imagine Nutty listening to Another One Bites The Dust while looting and boosting :p
18:58:00 <DoT`> when do preorder beta start?
18:58:14 <DoT`> nutty with best strat
18:58:25 <DoT`> oh damn, 2 hp
18:58:29 <carcinisation> so i am confused. i turn on stream and there is dude way outside the circle
18:58:34 <Halvgud> avoid all fights, get mad loot
18:58:34 <DoT`> nuytt is going to make it!
18:58:49 <carcinisation> don't you die super fast?
18:58:52 <DoT`> reif, thats nutyy who we are talking about
18:59:00 <Halvgud> 20-25 hp each hit
18:59:02 <DoT`> you take damage every 20 seconds
18:59:40 <DoT`> so he has been using medkits 40 seconds or so
18:59:45 <Halvgud> on the third hit your legs get broken and you must use kit
18:59:57 <DoT`> medkits are genrally a not so common item...
19:00:07 <DoT`> i wonder how many he has used, lol
19:00:15 <Halvgud> Must ask him after the game :p
19:01:13 <DoT`> nutty top 15! thats almopst garenteed through to finals
19:01:39 <Halvgud> Nutty still going strong! Imagine him making a speech about the value of medkits and multiple boosts
19:02:04 <Halvgud> Nice kill by break, such spray
19:02:27 <DoT`> nice spray control
19:02:31 <Halvgud> oh no nutty vs break

19:08:02 <Halvgud> no armor
19:08:12 <Halvgud> afaik
19:08:30 <Halvgud> ABCamper tho
19:08:50 <Halvgud> no gun, no gear, top 10
19:08:54 <carcinisation> do they know where the circle will close to or is it random?
19:09:01 <Halvgud> it's random
19:09:38 <Phearlock> yay sweden
19:09:40 <Phearlock> 1-0
19:10:09 <Halvgud> basically, so far I have seen, it's first circle random, then a 360 random angle inside the first circle that goes down to a central point.
19:10:23 <DoT`> awww
19:10:25 <DoT`> camper
19:10:27 <Halvgud> Not bad for ABCamper
19:10:44 <Halvgud> Nutty tho, come on

19:54:48 <Halvgud> Grand Final
19:55:16 <Phearlock> I'm watching the CS:go final
19:55:17 <Halvgud> https://www.twitch.tv/battleroyalegames
19:57:07 <Halvgud> Break with 11 mags for his M4
19:57:18 <DoT|Phone> the guts pig that driver
19:57:22 <Runbunny> I'm with phearlock then.
19:57:27 <Halvgud> He's ready to kill a loooot of ppl
19:58:07 <Phearlock> Good win for NIP map 1, looking like it's going to map 3 considering how map 2 is going
19:58:11 <DoT|Phone> or to get one shot
19:58:38 <Halvgud> oh, Mk16 SV. Nice
20:00:41 <Halvgud> Miniment down
20:01:23 <skram> Phearlock: cbble is such a boring map >_>
20:01:25 <Halvgud> The swamp is getting thick with campers
20:01:32 <skram> Do you know what the 3rd is?
20:01:38 <Phearlock> good thing it's going to map 3 then
20:01:43 <DoT|Phone> where I'd nutyy
20:01:49 <Halvgud> He ded
20:01:53 <DoT|Phone> aww
20:02:02 <Phearlock> Map? No
20:02:04 <Halvgud> he ded at place 45
20:02:10 <Phearlock> Mirage maybe
20:02:11 <Halvgud> :(
20:02:18 <skram> hmm
20:02:19 <Halvgud> after the legendary run last round
20:02:39 <skram> I didnt see the bans but i'd guess that train was banned out by nip and navi banned cache
20:02:45 <skram> so mirage or inferno id assume
20:03:52 <Camail> i wanna point out something really cool
20:04:05 <Camail> forest had his teamate from connector flash out
20:04:08 <Camail> so that he could scope
20:04:14 <Camail> without giving away his new position
20:04:21 <Camail> that flash wasn't even to blind anyone
20:05:13 <skram> thats pretty clever actually
20:05:20 <DoT|Phone> I can't see break halv
20:05:48 <Phearlock> The grenade misdirection stuff is really cool
20:05:54 <DoT|Phone> oh there he ifs

20:10:43 <Camail> he got the kill
20:10:47 <Camail> should've waited for the plant
20:10:50 <Camail> thne 2v1's
20:11:12 <Camail> also those nades that do 15 damage are very important from ct's
20:11:16 <Camail> even though they dont look like it
20:11:27 <Camail> because  a headshot with a ct rifle does 91 in one
20:11:53 <Camail> meaning that if they can do 10 health od damage with nades they are evening the playing field for raw duels
20:12:04 <DoT`> such spray
20:12:27 <Halvgud> Break vs FLux 
20:12:36 <DoT`> Break goig to kill flux
20:13:04 <Halvgud> narrow avoid there

22:07:53 <ZK> oh cool, new tlmc for new ladder maps!
22:09:28 <ZK> bio, you won! :D
22:09:37 <Bio> yeh
22:09:46 <Bio> we had a really tough 2nd period
22:09:57 <Bio> they put up 20+shots
22:10:01 <Bio> but damn
22:10:08 <Bio> Elliott is playing out of his mind
22:11:25 <ZK> so, you gonna be riding elliott through this?
22:11:55 <ZK> in my mind, jake allen was always the better goalie for some reason
22:12:16 <Bio> I honestly can't see how we wouldn't
22:12:20 <Bio> he's playing super well
22:12:32 <Bio> like... Halak with the habs good
22:13:50 <ZK> um, halak with the habs was him litterally alone vs two of the top teams. Blues at least have a good system with great defensemen :P
22:14:17 <ZK> If you guys win, it won't be only cause of Elliott I'd think, with your team doing well in game 1, and fuck game 2
22:14:47 <Bio> yeh, ells can't score the goals, but he's doing his part to keep us in it for damn sure
22:16:07 <Bio> we haven't won a playoff game at united center since 2002 
22:16:14 <Bio> yikes
22:16:17 <Bio> good sign
