00:55:34 <DoT`> thats good
00:55:42 <Micen> oen of my coworkers swapped me hours saturday
00:55:49 <Micen> so i get to see new pony live
00:55:56 <DoT`> skram, i just use pirate bay because lazy with books
00:56:03 <DoT`> nice micen!
00:56:09 <Micen> use kat.cr
00:56:37 <DoT`> kickass torrents is back?
00:56:41 <DoT`> they went down for a while
00:56:48 <Micen> they have been up for awhile
00:57:02 <DoT`> i dont pirate much since first world
00:57:43 <DoT`> its sad
00:58:02 <Micen> .choose art time,  wait a few minutes and stream time
00:59:18 <skram> any tips for epub/mobi reader?
01:00:09 <DoT`> read the comments on the torrent
01:00:16 <DoT`> oh for a reader
01:00:43 <Micen>  I use this
01:00:43 <Micen> https://calibre-ebook.com/
01:00:55 <DoT`> uhm i have a kindle from my bro i use, i use to use my laptop but its ded
01:01:08 <DoT`> thats the program i used, ty micen, couldnt recall the name
01:01:09 <skram> imma try that micen
01:01:45 <Micen> Glad I could help. I like it, also plays nice with phones/tablets for syncing e-books as well
01:01:57 <ZK> oh yea, i used calibre all the time
01:02:05 <ZK> well not as much since kickass has most of them in epub
01:02:21 <ZK> wait, why dont you pirate anymore DoT` :po
01:02:46 <DoT`> not much atm
01:03:02 <DoT`> i shoudl pirate more but i really have no idea how strict they are in uk
01:03:08 <DoT`> and am poor
01:03:41 <ZK> ohhhhhh
01:03:45 <ZK> cant you just proxy?
01:04:23 <DoT`> i can but am paranoid
01:06:40 <DoT`> i do miss the no worry piratinng in south africa, so third world
01:07:55 <DoT`> we also had OC, a 2000+ ppl LAN every month, where it was pretty much just a weekend of copying stuff on thier file sharing program
01:08:18 <DoT`> yfirst world has such ncie intenret you dont need to copy form other ppl, but its monitired, completly ruins it
01:09:56 <ZK> so paranoid
01:10:00 <ZK> nothing better than pirating!
01:12:49 <DoT`> so many games i  can never recomend to ppl because i dont get to try them
01:13:00 <DoT`> so its really just hurting the market
01:13:28 <Camail> you only ever get hit with pirating charges if you seed
01:32:05 <ZK> plus, proxies

18:07:41 <Runbunny> I don't want spoilers.
18:09:20 <DuB`> DoT` I decided that I DON'T want oberwaj yet because I wouldn't even have time to play and that would be even MORE agonizing.
18:09:46 <DoT`> well you dont get a choice in a weeks time or so
18:10:06 <DuB`> That's not for a month, still!
18:10:15 <DuB`> May, not April.
18:10:20 <DoT`> i tohught it was the 4th or 9th or something
18:12:56 <DuB`> Of may.
18:13:05 <DuB`> :(
18:14:03 <Yolteotl> pones!
18:14:16 <Yolteotl> I'll get my BSO tomorrow \o/

18:28:32 <Yolteotl> Liberator ability radius reduction from 5 to 4
18:28:34 <Yolteotl> nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
18:29:05 <carcinisation> but freedom...

18:31:58 <DoT|Phone> you pon
18:32:28 <carcinisation> at least there is ravager nerf
18:35:34 <DuB`> Yolt :P
18:36:01 <Yolteotl> hi    dub
18:36:23 <DuB`> -1 freedom
18:36:33 <DuB`> 20% less freedom.
18:38:58 <carcinisation> dub snela
18:39:07 <DoT|Phone> 20% less cool
18:39:18 <carcinisation> 20% less radius
18:39:33 <carcinisation> and how do you calc area of circle?
18:40:16 <Yolteotl> it's even worst
18:40:25 <Yolteotl> yes reif is right
18:40:27 <Yolteotl> and smart
18:40:59 <Yolteotl> pi*(.8*R)^2 = pi*(.64*R^2).  Compute the percent of the new to the old:   (pi*.64R^2)/(pi*R^2) = .64  The decrease then is 100 - 64 = 36%
18:41:00 <carcinisation> i seem to remember bliz getting it wrong once when nerfing mines before :/
18:44:14 <DuB`> Let's just remove 100% of the freedom and give them squirt guns.
18:44:47 <Rawr|Fone> Excellent idea

23:30:37 <carcinisation> http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Arkanoid
23:31:29 <DoT`> weird maps
23:32:27 <ZK> looking at the 8 player map, not all spawn configurations are possible. The 3 closest are blocked.
23:32:29 <ZK> so not that bad
23:32:34 <ZK> still scary, but ya know
23:36:10 <ZK> Ya know what? I feel like i should play terran for a bit
23:36:18 <ZK> timings and stuff are fun
23:37:17 <DoT`> now that freedom has been nerfed?
23:37:37 <ZK> wut?
23:37:40 <ZK> freedom was nerfed?
23:37:53 <DoT`> 20% less cool
