00:53:13 <Dot`> Skram
00:53:57 <Dot`> i want to know why "please" is 3 words in norwegion
00:54:35 <skram> because it has no direct translation in that context?
00:55:57 <DuB`> Rude.

01:05:45 <skram> jau
01:05:54 <Dot`> I have another dum question
01:06:15 <Dot`> du vs dere?
01:07:10 <Dot`> this example has "Snakker dere norsk?" and "Snakker du engelsk?"
01:07:15 <skram> du singular dere definitive plural
01:07:20 <Dot`> why change "you"?
01:07:29 <DuB`> You v yous
01:07:34 <DuB`> ;D
01:08:07 <Dot`> those sentences are the same! just a diffrent pronoun
01:08:21 <Dot`> this is why i failed afrikaans
01:08:49 <skram> no, dere is a specific plural
01:08:58 <skram> wait hold on
01:09:08 <DuB`> skram pls.
01:09:25 <DuB`> Hesten skram
01:09:25 <Dot`> snela
01:10:15 <Dot`> i also could not tell you what a definite pronoun is even in english
01:10:22 <skram> no me neither
01:10:49 <Dot`> im positive the only reason i  speak english is becuase i speak english
01:11:00 <DuB`> SeemsGood
01:11:01 <skram> well dere is a 2nd person pronoun
01:11:06 <Dot`> otherwise i would just have to point at everything
01:11:23 <DuB`> < ^ v >
01:11:41 <skram> as in
01:11:43 <skram> you guys
01:11:43 <skram> right
01:11:48 <Dot`> yes
01:12:02 <skram> and have you in the 1st person
01:12:17 <skram> no wait hold on
01:12:18 <skram> ugh
01:12:41 <skram> you is 2nd person singular and dere is 2nd person plural
01:12:42 <skram> there
01:12:54 <skram> there's also subjective and objective forms
01:12:59 <Dot`> skram, also how much of a country accent you have? are you like a norwegion yorkshireman?
01:13:08 <Dot`> :P
01:13:15 <skram> uuh probably
01:14:10 <Dot`> good to know
01:15:36 <DuB`> Redneck viking?
01:15:55 <skram> yes
01:15:58 <Dot`> please, redneck is like yorkshire cross east londoner
01:16:29 <DuB`> England is so small, how can you have such regional differences!
01:16:35 <Dot`> wars
01:16:46 <DuB`> D:
01:16:47 <Dot`> and scandanavian raids
01:17:02 <DuB`> ... so it's SKRAM'S fault!
01:17:25 <Dot`> Ja
01:17:42 <skram> My ancestors were all peaceful woodsmen
01:17:45 <skram> far removed from the sea
01:17:57 <Dot`> you supplied the wood that made the boats
01:18:26 <Dot`> litrally the root of the problem
01:18:27 <DuB`> MY ancestors were... swiss, mostly.
01:18:31 <skram> No, we burnt the wood to create fertile soil
01:19:31 <Dot`> on one side of my family i have english peseant farmer, on the other something danish
01:20:45 <skram> very exciting
01:20:51 <Dot`> indeed
01:21:01 <Dot`> very peseant
01:21:26 <skram> I've traced my dads family back to the mid 1600s
01:21:35 <skram> all peasants and poor people
01:21:53 <Dot`> woohoo
01:22:43 <DuB`> My mom found some assassin named "Pepin" in our ancient genealogy.
01:22:47 <DuB`> Heh.
01:23:15 <skram> thats pretty cool
01:23:25 <Dot`> ah, we now see why the genji dub
01:23:36 <Dot`> you cant help it
01:23:50 <DuB`> >_>
01:23:51 <skram> A fair few of my ancestors did move to america because they were tired of potatoes though
01:24:01 <skram> lots of them probably starved there too
01:25:26 <DuB`> Wee!
01:25:57 <Dot`> DUB
01:26:02 <DuB`> "That's it, mom! I'm tired of potatoes, I'm moving to america!"
01:26:03 <Dot`> hows studies
01:26:11 <DuB`> *He happens to arrive on thanksgiving day*
01:26:22 <DuB`> "Here, pass the mashed potatoes to our new friend over there."
01:26:30 <skram> FFFFFFFFUUUUUU
01:26:39 <Dot`> haha
01:26:41 <skram> america was a mistake

04:13:59 <Camail> you need time to wake up so you wont be retarded
04:14:07 <Camail> everyone is retarded when they wake up
04:23:31 <skram> some people are retarded all day too
04:24:04 <Camail> yea but you aren't taking any tests
04:24:13 <Camail> (zing)
04:24:36 <skram> shut the fuck up camail
04:24:39 <skram> your jokes are shit
04:24:43 <skram> your face is shit
04:24:46 <Camail> no u
04:24:50 <Camail> (zing)
04:25:08 * skram slaps Camail around a bit with a large trout
04:25:14 <Camail> ow
04:25:44 <skram> u deserve it
04:25:56 <DuB`> Such rude.
04:26:32 <skram> I am telling him WHERE THE CABINET IS TO BE PLACED.
04:27:10 <Camail> i dont get that reference
04:27:43 <skram> You know how torbjørn has voicelines that doesnt really make sense? its like that
04:28:22 <Camail> oh
04:28:26 <Camail> you get santa skin yet?
04:28:32 <skram> yeah boii
04:28:39 <Camail> oh, buy it?
04:28:45 <skram> drop
04:28:48 <Camail> nice
04:29:22 <skram> I dont think im gonna buy any skins until right before it ends
04:29:33 <Camail> yea especially legendaries
04:29:36 <Camail> that shit is brutal
04:29:52 <skram> because spending 3k monies on a thing and then getting duplicate drops would be aggraveting
04:29:57 <DuB`> 3k witch mercy. T_T
04:30:13 <Camail> rip dub's wallet
04:30:37 <DuB`> I have 2k now though, so I can get reaper skin, widow intro, mercy pose for sure.
04:30:44 <DuB`> Er no, 3k now.
04:30:44 <DuB`> ez
04:30:54 <DuB`> If they don't drop~
04:30:58 <Camail> but you dont use reaper
04:31:07 <skram> i already have half the stuff i want
04:31:15 <skram> need elf tracer tho
04:31:20 <DuB`> Meh.
04:31:25 <DuB`> Scarf tracer still #1.
04:31:26 <Camail> i might get elf tracer, i like that one
04:32:52 <Camail> i kinda want more skins that are true to character and not just seasonal
04:34:21 <skram> what do you mean?
04:34:30 <skram> like relevant to a characters backstory?
04:34:39 <skram> because there is not a lot to go on :p
04:35:28 <Camail> like, character design characterization
04:35:59 <Camail> all the vanilla costumes are well designed and have a lot of personality in them
04:36:13 <Camail> having more of that would be nice
04:36:32 <skram> hmm
04:36:51 <skram> i mean, its consistent with their very very limited backstory
04:36:56 <skram> which is probably part of it
04:37:11 <skram> dont know how they would go about it
04:37:41 <Camail> we have all the fundamental parts of each character's personality, design based off that and not the story
04:38:01 <Camail> I don't dress based on my backstory, but on my general outlook on life and personality
04:38:25 <Camail> some people dress to be seen, some people dress to hide, to conform, plenty of stuff like that
04:38:36 <Camail> tracer being british and shit
04:38:39 <Camail> slap a flag on her face
04:38:42 <Camail> so much character
04:38:45 <skram> haha
04:38:57 <skram> tea based skin
04:39:01 <skram> instantly british
04:39:02 <Camail> but really, the pose fiasco is a good comparison
04:39:02 <skram> SORTED
04:39:19 <Camail> give her a tea bag emote
04:39:27 <Camail> then make soldier push her into some water
04:39:35 <skram> i like it
05:31:04 <DuB`> MISTLETOE MERCY
05:31:16 <skram> GOOD NIGHT DuB`
