00:21:10 <Dot_> true pinkie fashion?
00:22:05 <Camail> oh, no
00:22:28 <Camail> it must have been one of those server bugs where the client says a diff block is there
00:22:43 <Camail> its all supposed to be one color
00:22:45 <Dot_> cam just trying to avoid getting stabbed
00:23:01 <Camail> I'm unstabbable, but thats besides the point
00:31:09 <motbob> website idea: provide people with a historical calendar of anime airdates. Let them watch anime as it aired in history, with filters for MAL rankings and popularity
00:33:31 <ZK> That does sound like a cool idea
