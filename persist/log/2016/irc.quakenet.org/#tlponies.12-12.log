01:37:24 <DuBwork> Though I think my favorite words are katt and melk.
01:37:35 <skram> my favorite word is katt too
01:43:33 <DuBwork> Can't wait to get to tenses and conjugationstuff.
01:46:21 <skram> You're gonna be so confused if you learn all this stuff and then try to speak with someone who has a weird dialect
01:46:33 <DuBwork> ...I will just avoid those people.
01:46:45 <skram> But I thought we were friends!
01:46:49 <DuBwork> ... oh.
01:46:56 <DuBwork> HMMM.
01:47:05 <Dot`> is halv one of those ppl skram?
01:47:45 <DuBwork> Oh shoot, C9 v CoL OW right now.
01:47:47 <DuBwork> Nooooooooooooooooooo
01:48:19 <skram> Hah. Yes Dot`.
01:48:35 <skram> Thought I suppose weird is all relative.
01:48:47 <Dot`> oh boy
01:49:12 <Dot`> im busy comfirming to myself that i suck at laungages
01:50:00 <skram> first you need to become a nerd dot
01:50:31 <DuBwork> Crucial step.
01:50:33 <Dot`> i am a nerd!
01:50:39 <Dot`> just not a language one
01:50:58 <DuBwork> If you can't think to yourself "OH BOY, PRONOUNS", you are missing step one.
01:51:56 <skram> You're not missing anything, this match is terribly boring
01:51:57 <Dot`> i do think "OH BOY DIGITAL SYSTEMS" and "OH BOY 320 TONN THING SPINNING AT 60 TIMES A SECOND"
01:52:21 <DuBwork> Dat tank meta.
01:52:22 <DuBwork> Yuck
01:53:00 <DuBwork> Dot` I'm pretty sure things that big don't spin that fast.
01:53:01 <DuBwork> Lies.
01:53:41 <skram> Wow. CoL had 6 ults and C9 had like 2 and still managed to lose the point on Well
01:53:54 <DuBwork> I saw that! 
01:54:00 <Dot`> They probably shouldnt, especialy with only a few millimeters clearance
01:54:02 <Dot`> fun stuff
01:54:03 <DuBwork> Not sure how they got out of that blizzard, hah.
01:54:13 <DuBwork> WEW
01:54:28 <Dot`> dub work is lies, he doesnt work
01:54:30 <skram> would a boat propeller weigh 320 tons Dot`
01:54:41 <skram> for like a emma maersk class ship
01:55:07 <Dot`> it was a Hydroelectric dam skram, for peak hour 
01:55:17 <skram> neat
01:55:33 <DuBwork> No skram.
01:55:41 <DuBwork> Biggest ship propeller is 113 tons. ;D
01:55:57 <Dot`> dub with the google
01:56:02 <DuBwork> Yah.
01:56:08 <skram> In 2006, MMG produced the world's largest ship propeller for the Emma Maersk, which at 1,302 feet (397m) is one of the longest container ships ever constructed.
01:56:47 <skram> neat
01:56:50 <Dot`> 320 tons a a lot
01:57:09 <skram> said ship also has the most powerful ICE created
01:57:23 <skram> MECHANICS ARE FUN
01:57:32 <DuBwork> BIG MANLY MACHINES
01:58:11 <Dot`> RAWR
01:58:29 <skram> 70MW of internal combustion DuBwork

02:02:40 <skram> I have a 144hz monitor
02:02:41 <Camail> 144hz doesnt really help with overwatch, but it feels nice
02:02:57 <skram> ...but my fps doesnt go >120 in overwatch
02:03:29 <DuBwork> I just wanted ANY second monitor, and happened to find this one for just a bit more than another I was looking at.
02:03:31 <DuBwork> So why not!
02:03:40 <skram> probably helps if you play hitscandudes
02:04:47 <DuBwork> What a bad graviton. >_>
02:04:51 <DuBwork> I'll take it.
02:05:05 <skram> tracer carry though

02:18:18 <DuBwork> Overtime, though. :(
02:18:29 <DuBwork> Shoulda had that win.
02:18:35 <skram> this means more game!

02:18:56 <DuBwork> Less study. :P
02:19:02 <skram> ah pfft
02:19:14 <skram> its only NA OW anyway

02:23:29 <DuBwork> I don't even know what happened.
02:23:43 <DuBwork> C9 lost two or three, and then suddenly all of CoL died in like 2 seconds.
02:23:59 <skram> surefour put his serious face on
02:24:33 <DuBwork> I saw so many harbleu zarya blunders that game, hahaha
02:24:41 <DuBwork> He's a scary roadhog, but...
02:24:54 <skram> best roadhog NA
02:24:57 <skram> zarya not so much
02:28:37 <Camail> zarya strongest waif
02:28:44 <Camail> can lift other waif at same time
02:28:52 <skram> strong as the mountain
02:29:18 <DuBwork> A waif is a living creature removed, by hardship, loss or other helpless circumstance, from its original surroundings. The most common usage of the word is to designate a homeless, forsaken or orphaned child
02:30:06 <Camail> wrong  word
02:30:12 <Camail> its a homonym

20:45:28 <Rawr|Fone> What a silly language
20:45:40 <Camail> they're all silly languages
20:46:44 <skram> ur a silly language
20:48:12 <Camail> jwong is playing fighting games at the white house for some reason
20:48:22 <Dot> how odd
20:48:33 <Camail> i think obama wants to ignite some thuggery and ruin the whitehouse before he leaves
20:49:10 <skram> good man
20:49:44 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/getcovered
20:49:54 <Camail> twitch, sponsored by whitehouse
20:50:30 <Camail> he needs to put as many minorities inside as possible to rebalance the scales for the next 4 years
20:52:04 <Dot> it strikes me as a very odd venue for this
20:52:12 <Dot> maybe im not american enough
20:53:29 <skram> Do you think we can play some overwatch in buckingham palace dot?
20:54:01 <Dot> after that the taj mahal
20:55:31 <Camail> well the white house isnt the capital building
20:55:40 <Camail> there are a ton of events
20:56:12 <Camail> if it was gonna be anywhere in a government building it'd be the white house

21:01:29 <skram> ????????????
21:01:53 <Dot> wat skram
21:01:57 <Camail> well, most ads are normal
21:02:09 <Camail> but the ones directed towards our demographic aren't
21:02:17 <Camail> regular tv ads are super boring
21:02:47 <Camail> i just want to give out christmas presents right now =/
21:02:54 <Camail> waiting for christmas suuuucks

22:42:48 <Camail> if you understand all the available material then ur done
22:43:16 <DuB`> Unless the available study material is lacking!
22:43:44 <Camail> it isn't
22:43:57 <Camail> they suck as a teacher if they test you on something you never learned
22:44:44 <Camail> you've had tests with this person before, would they do that?
22:45:03 <Camail> finals are 9 times out of 10 just a bigger mid term
22:45:38 <DuB`> Obscure applications of topics we didn't exactly focus on, sure.
22:47:21 <Camail> "didn't exactly focus on" isn't entirely helpful as a descriptor. Did you have at least one class period where it was mentioned and discussed? or was it just "look at the book stuff"
22:47:59 <DuB`> We've had stuff show up on tests that was a brief section in the textbook, but never mentioned in class.
22:48:26 <Camail> that's dumb, is the test just taken from the book or something
22:49:34 <DuB`> Not all of it, of course.
22:49:55 <Camail> well either way its not like you'll be able to cram every section of every chapter

22:56:49 <skram> I do the dishes and everything
22:56:57 <skram> No Dot, I am currently at work
22:57:40 <Dot> if skram moves to america it makes it hard for me to sneak into his house and take up residence
22:58:35 <DuB`> You could still do that!
22:58:42 <DuB`> You'll just need to do some extra norsk study.
23:08:40 <skram> i have some homework for you mr DuB` 
23:08:48 <DuB`> Oh boi
23:09:11 <skram> Do your placements so we can play
23:09:20 <DuB`> ...
23:09:31 <skram> Both me and bio are way above 3k now!
23:11:00 <DuB`> Carry me senpai.
23:12:06 <skram> You know I would if i could
23:13:04 <DuB`> Solo placements sounds so blehhhhhhhhh. T_T
23:14:13 <Camail> dub pls
23:14:17 <Runbunny> I am 4 loses and 1 draw these placements ;)
23:14:31 <Camail> run y u bad
23:14:55 <DuB`> Good thing is that placements apparently don't even matter this season.
23:15:03 <DuB`> It just puts you near your previous rank, or something.
23:15:28 <Camail> dub i will play with you
23:15:30 <Camail> and only play mei
23:15:35 <Camail> to amek you think you are palying with skram
23:15:39 <Camail> make*
23:15:59 <DuB`> I dunno, he has a BIT more of an accent than you.
23:16:04 <DuB`> Also less salt. ;D
23:16:07 <Camail> i can stick a dick in my outh
23:16:16 <Camail> i am not salty in ow
23:17:10 <Camail> also i really hope, with no actually expectation, that the fgc will get the word salty back
23:17:28 <Camail> its really unfortunate that it just means "mad in a videog ame" now
23:17:47 <Camail> the psychology behind the original meaning is so fascinating
23:17:51 <Camail> now its gone forever
23:18:33 <Camail> but fine, enjoy going 3-7
23:19:06 <DuB`> I'll probably do them friday. :o
23:21:05 <Runbunny> Honestly, my placement matches isn't mostly due to myself. I should just stop playing with friends, I usually have better games then.
23:22:13 <skram> did you just make fun of my accent dub
23:22:30 <Camail> well he said you HAD an accent
23:22:32 <DuB`> I noted that you have more of one than cam!
23:22:38 <Camail> i said it was like having a dick in your mouth
23:22:45 <Camail> i dont have an accent
