01:05:51 <Camail> fucking
01:05:57 <Camail> the only thing that would make this not suck
01:06:00 <Camail> is if they fired koosta
01:06:03 <Camail> RIGHT now
01:06:07 <Camail> and that won't happen
01:06:24 <Camail> even though koosta makes no sense on their team
01:06:26 <DoT`> this was the saddest thing i have seen in a while :/
01:06:36 <Camail> even though koosta is young
01:06:37 <Camail> dumb
01:06:37 <Camail> and na
01:06:45 <Camail> which is what lost them these two games
01:07:46 <Camail> or if adren replaces stewie on c9
