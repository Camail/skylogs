00:00:10 <DoT`> I hope she has a swiss accent
00:00:25 <DoT`> or you will kill my immersion
00:00:31 <Camail> she is mute
00:00:34 <Camail> like everyone in pubs
00:02:04 <DoT`> you mean she sprays everything and says hello
00:02:14 <DoT`> Hello!
00:02:17 <DoT`> Hello!
00:02:21 <DoT`> Hello!
00:02:27 <skram> How barbaric!
00:03:06 <Camail> fitting
00:05:25 <DoT`> im waiting to see how cam creates bastion and kills us all
00:05:36 <Camail> war forged
00:05:38 <Camail> look em up
00:05:56 <DoT`> you seem prepared very quickly to awnser that
00:05:58 <DoT`> im worried
00:06:10 <Camail> good
00:06:14 <Camail> fear is good
00:06:37 <DoT`> eh, i will probably just distract it
00:07:07 <Camail> fear the 1/16th chance you get fukt
00:07:36 <DoT`> 2% cam! and you rolled far better than required!
00:07:46 <DoT`> i fear all your rolls
00:07:55 <Camail> 19 18 18 19 i think
00:08:02 <Camail> then high damage
00:08:09 <DoT`> yes
00:08:12 <Camail> skram what u doing for level 4, any ideas
00:08:27 <Camail> those rolls would've KOd anyone
00:08:34 <DoT`> getting a cane and monocle 
00:08:49 <Camail> you guys spent so much money on clothes
00:08:54 <DoT`> no
00:08:58 <DoT`> they did
00:09:03 <Camail> the party as a whole
00:09:08 <Camail> you are all responsible for the weakness of others
00:09:09 <DoT`> i am p;oor from making hp potions
00:09:14 <Camail> 2
00:09:16 <Camail> rip
00:09:16 <skram> ugh i made bookmarks in the phb and they all got lost when i rebooted
00:09:22 <DoT`> yes
00:09:29 <DoT`> i was poor to start
00:09:31 <Camail> gg
00:09:46 <skram> im gonna go +2 str i guess
00:09:47 <Camail> you have gotten like 60 since then at least
00:09:51 <DoT`> 25 gold is a lot
00:10:01 <Camail> skram I'm just gonna put it out there, savage attack
00:10:06 <Camail> just puttin it out there
00:10:11 <Camail> in front of ur meat face
00:10:19 <Camail> your meaty, meaty face
00:10:33 <Camail> I have 0 idea why I'm so obsessed with that feat
00:12:12 <DoT`> that does pretty much increase your damage by 3 a turn
00:12:35 <DoT`> GS is d12 right?
00:13:08 <Camail> statistically it is kinda like having advantage once per turn because it skews your effective damage up
00:13:26 <Camail> also you decide if you want to use  savage attack after th first damage die is rolled, i believe
00:13:59 <DoT`> yea, you can choose to reroll, then pick either
00:14:08 <Camail> so if you get a 10, no need to reroll it, if your frenzy raged at lvl 5 thats 3 attacks you have the option of rerolling after you see damage (for each)
00:14:25 <Camail> or just gos trength
00:14:34 <Camail> because i dont want to build your character for you
00:14:43 <Camail> but your super new so i didnt want you to miss other options
00:16:55 <Camail> also wtf Tough is basically +4 consitution when it comes to health, dub should take that
00:17:00 <Camail> be the meatiest wizard ever
00:21:41 <skram> dunno
00:21:42 <skram> i mean
00:22:00 <skram> i wanna pad my stats
00:22:20 <Camail> totally fine :P
00:22:22 <skram> but i would have to use both in the same to raise my modifier
00:22:50 <Camail> did you read through all the feats
00:22:52 <skram> and +1 CON would give me 1 AC and 1 hp per level
00:23:00 <skram> Yeah they just didnt appeal to me
00:23:00 <Camail> you might find something you like
00:23:02 <Camail> ah
00:24:00 <DoT`> cr Phearlock http://imgur.com/gallery/zo3LBjF
00:24:22 <Phearlock> adorbs
00:24:33 <Camail> yea, the only feat that helps with constitution is durable
00:25:20 <Camail> which compliments your beefy barbarian nature, if thats the kind of thing you want out of your character
00:25:40 <Camail> thought the +1 to attack and damage is always nice
00:25:52 <skram> im sorta torn on that
00:25:55 <Camail> helps with strength check where you already have advantage
00:26:08 <Camail> you have a few days to decide, feelf ree to talk it out if you want
00:26:17 <Camail> oh wait
00:26:18 <Camail> I'm an idiot
00:26:21 <Camail> you have a long time
00:26:23 <Camail> its lvl 4
00:26:25 <Camail> my brain fried
00:26:27 <skram> i like the idea of being pretty tanky and up in peoples faces
00:26:41 <skram> but i also like the idea of hitting things hard
00:26:45 <Camail> I'm prepping stuff for levels 3-6 so its like... the actual space-time you are in is different from mine
00:27:13 <Camail> +1 weapons and proficiency scaling help with that, also I'm gonna start using flanking
00:27:35 <Camail> flanking is a cool variant that encourages you to think rather than just rely on stats
00:27:35 <skram> i suppose from a more tactical standpoint it would be more beneficial to have a tanking dude since everyone else is squishy as fuck, except for ferlok
00:27:49 <skram> how does flanking work
00:27:51 <Camail> corso is quite a good tank, but he is very big with big armor
00:27:54 <Camail> people dont like attacking him
00:27:57 <Camail> especially archers
00:28:05 <Camail> why attack the big armor dude when he can attack dub
00:28:17 <Camail> i cant imagine a scenario where someone willingly attacks corso over anyone else
00:28:39 <Camail> but rho and bardum both have no armor, so it isnt immediately obvious how hard they are to hit
00:29:17 <Camail> thats one of the advantages to unarmored classes, and a disadvantage for people who like big armor
00:29:29 <Camail> like, someone is gonna shoot rho, and he's gonna catch the arrow
00:29:35 <Camail> and he is gonna realize he dun fukt up
00:29:36 <DoT`> im not that hard to hit, only ac 15
00:29:39 <Camail> dot
00:29:40 <DoT`> i mean harder than dub
00:29:41 <Camail> 15 is a lot
00:29:55 <Camail> you dont understand, its actually a good ac
00:29:57 <Camail> especially for lvl 3
00:30:44 <Camail> dub has 10 ac, he's getting hit all the time
00:31:00 <Camail> unless he uses shield, or mage armor
00:31:02 <DoT`> dub needs some mage armour
00:31:25 <Camail> i dunno if he has it
00:31:31 <Camail> i told him it was a good idea tho
00:31:48 <DoT`> wizards have 2 things, magic missle and mage armour
00:31:50 <DoT`> please 
00:31:56 <Camail> oh he does have it
00:31:59 <Camail> he just never uses it
00:32:00 <Camail> because dumb
00:32:02 <DoT`> lol
00:32:20 <Camail> .tell dub` you have fucking mage armor, it lasts 8 hours, use it
00:32:30 <DoT`> HAHA
00:32:35 <DoT`> whats the AC adition?
00:32:39 <Camail> 13+dex
00:32:50 <Camail> so he would have 13
00:33:04 <Camail> it wouldnt do anything for you, sadly
00:33:33 <Camail> it affects base ac, which is what unarmored also changes
00:35:50 <Camail> .tell dub` also mynu has detect magic
00:36:32 <Camail> though it is good flavor for vanessa
00:37:55 <Camail> surprised dub didnt want http://ephe.github.io/grimoire/spells/snillocs-snowball-swarm
00:37:59 <Camail> become the mei
00:39:14 <skram> thats a good spell name if you wanna roleplay invoker
00:39:27 <skram> actually maybe I should do that for my backup character
00:40:07 <skram> I could just steal his lines! No need for original content at all!
00:40:55 <Camail> lets not do that last part
00:41:12 <Camail> you could be The Evocer tho

00:42:04 <skram> but cam i wanna shout things while i cast spells that have cool names
00:42:19 <Camail> sure but make them up yourself
00:42:31 <Camail> yould be funny to have a wizard that renames spells and acts like their his own
00:43:07 <Camail> Evocer's Ethereal Projectiles
00:43:21 <skram> no dude those are magic missiles
00:43:30 <skram> ETHEREAL. PROJECTILES.
00:44:12 <Camail> Ball of Fire
00:44:16 <Camail> ok now you aren't even trying
00:46:22 <skram> http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/1/18/Invo_rare_04.mp3
00:47:53 <Camail> ok so you know how dub needs to elarn shit from spellbooks, at first i was just randomly choosing spells, but i got unseen servant in every book and was like fuck this
00:48:03 <Camail> my rolls were terribly boring sometimes
00:49:37 <Camail> blur is a great spell, classic wizard spell
00:57:08 <DuB`> Many pings.
00:57:11 <DuB`> 8 hours!?
00:57:21 <DuB`> Oh. :P
00:58:28 <Camail> also...why is your health 17
00:58:51 <Camail> did you roll or take 4
00:59:23 <Camail> 6+3,4+3 is 16, then next level is 23
00:59:25 <DoT`> wow 17
00:59:34 <Camail> he's beefy
00:59:51 <DoT`> mine is 21
00:59:57 <Camail> dub i suggest reading every spell from 1-2
00:59:57 <DoT`> so beefy dub
01:00:05 <Camail> hey he has a d6 hit die
01:00:12 <Camail> he's pretty damn resilient
01:00:14 <Camail> somehow
01:00:42 <Camail> since HP more or less = will to fight, I'm just counting that as vanessa being super stubborn
01:00:49 <Camail> and not wanting to die
01:04:20 <DuB`> RARRR.
01:06:17 <Camail> this is cool http://anydice.com/program/448c
01:06:37 <Camail> found a site that lets you see stats for any dice roll
01:09:23 <Phant> I caught a glimpse of some Alvin and the Chipmunks CGI TV show as I was flipping through channels, one of the creepiest things I have ever seen.
01:09:37 <Phant> They made their faces so human looking.
01:11:05 <Camail> also DuB`  your spell save dc is 14, by unticking proffieciency apparently it was saying your save dc was 12
01:11:11 <Camail> dunno why it id that but i fixed it
01:18:17 <Camail> if you have advantage on a roll, then use luck, the mean value is 15.5
01:18:26 <Camail> talk about ripping the choice out of fate's hands
01:21:55 <Camail> also dub i dunno if you knew this but arcane recovery is only once per long rest, the thing that lets you recover (1/2)*level spells during a short rest
01:22:37 <DuB`> Ah.
01:24:47 <Camail> but now you can recover 2 levels of spells
01:24:59 <Camail> so 2 lvl 1s or 1 lvl 2

02:28:20 <Camail> it costs a bit of money
02:29:45 <DuB`> Oh hoh.
02:31:39 <Camail> it's something that I will allow as a dm, but you are gonna have to earn it
02:33:24 <Camail> also it gets unreasonably expensive at higher levels
02:34:36 <Camail> also DoT`  the "house rule" of 5gp and 25gp a day is actually not a house rule
02:38:55 <Camail> oh wait yes it is

03:10:00 <Camail> dnd has rules about spending your day in a brothel
03:10:41 <Camail> "attending parties, binge drinking.gambling, or anything else that helps them cope with the perils they face"
03:11:01 <Camail> eyup, mention gambling and drinking and partying...gee, one thing is missing
03:11:09 <Camail> wonder if its under the "other" section
03:13:23 <Camail> hmm, its only 4gp a day for brothels
03:13:32 <Camail> i feel as if I'd want to pay more, for my own sake
03:13:46 <Camail> an entire day in a brothel = a con save for bacterial infections
03:14:06 <Camail> con + [gold spent]/5 rounded down
03:14:22 <Camail> maybe divided by 4
03:14:32 <Camail> yea I'm calling this houserule official
03:15:43 <Camail> gonna come up with a list of bacterial STIs, assign a DC to each and a number, then roll for random STI
03:15:56 <Camail> these are the homebrews that matter, people
