15:31:16 <Bio> oh boi
15:31:19 <Bio> ot?
15:31:28 <skram> probably
15:31:54 <DoT`> why dont they just have first to 16?
15:32:44 <Bio> reasons.
15:32:52 <DoT`> k
15:33:10 <Bio> idk, 30 rounds + ot is just how its been
15:34:08 <skram> because playing 3 rounds on each side makes it more even I guess
15:35:24 <Bio> pretty good round there
15:35:28 <skram> sudden death is a silly format anyway
15:36:15 <Bio> too much !drop ban in chat
15:36:21 <Bio> lagging muh twitch
15:36:25 <DoT`> well its not really sudden after 30 rounds
15:37:44 <skram> first to score a round after normal playtime has passed? Thats what sudden death is, dot :p
15:37:57 <DoT`> so win 16 wins?
15:38:18 <skram> And of course if 10 minutes passes and nobody wins a round they play 2 rounds on aim_map2.
15:38:44 <DoT`> what does a round consist of?
15:39:00 <skram> shooting, mostly
15:39:09 <Bio> some grenades sometimes
15:39:23 <Bio> lagggggggggg
15:39:23 <DoT`> usefull as always
15:39:24 <Bio> pls
15:40:35 <DoT`> see, i dont understand why more games are played now
15:41:30 <Bio> because vovlo says so
15:41:46 <DoT`> that doesnt explain at what poit one team actually wina
15:41:51 <DoT`> point*
15:42:11 <Bio> its like trying to argue why soccer matches are however many mins
15:42:13 <skram> Well if you want to do first to 16 it means that you have an uneven amount of rounds (31) which means that one team will have an advantage because most maps have an advantage towards T or CT
15:42:14 <Bio> it just is
15:42:56 <DoT`> so how many rounds before nip and flipside change sides then skram?
15:43:06 <skram> This way they have an equal amount of time (potentially) on each side which might (or not) make it more of a level playing field so there is no randomness or flukes or whatever
15:43:07 <skram> 3
15:43:19 <DoT`> bio overtime in soccer has rules aon when it occurs and for how long
15:43:46 <skram> and then another 3 if they are still on equal wins
15:44:08 <skram> so if you lose the first 2 and then win the last 4 you are winrar
15:44:45 <DoT`> so a team needs a 3 game lead after 14 to win?
15:45:24 <Bio> no
15:45:25 <skram> no they need to have a lead after 6 rounds
15:45:43 <DoT`> 14 form the very start
15:45:54 <Bio> where are you getting 14
15:46:07 <DoT`> 30 rounds to star

23:25:00 <skram> rude
23:43:16 <skram> c9 does the right click pop flash toss thing a lot
23:43:49 <Camail> stewie does
23:43:54 <Camail> thats for sure
23:44:15 <Camail> right click is the best for flashing yourself into an angle
23:44:32 <Camail> which means either 1. no teamwork or 2. they play in isolated spots where they can't get support flashes
23:44:36 <skram> well yeah
23:44:58 <Camail> I'm guessing a bit of 1 and 2
23:45:42 <skram> pretty good out of smoke too, since you probably cant see it and you cant hear it
23:46:09 <skram> Does smoke diminish the effect of flashes at all?
23:46:54 <Camail> no
23:47:15 <Camail> the flash will always hit the ground if you lob it from even ground
23:47:22 <Camail> its pretty unreactable 
23:47:38 <Camail> but pros are good at juking flashes while looking at smokes
23:48:01 <skram> true
23:48:37 <skram> avoiding flashes is a skill all in itself
