19:35:02 <Camail> i attached my main to my phone, but i encourage everyone to opt in so evne if i play on my smurf, when i mm with a group of prime people with will still try and match the group up with other prime members
19:35:22 <Camail> this might be a really really good way to reduce the buying of accounts
19:35:35 <Camail> unfortunately there are a lot of private hacks
19:37:16 <Camail> oh shit
19:37:24 <Camail> inferno is out of the active duty map group? what?
19:37:31 <Camail> are they redoing inferno next??????????????????
19:37:33 <Camail> oh shit boys
19:37:41 <Camail> RIP my fucking banana smokes
19:37:47 <Camail> I got some good use out of them tho
19:41:29 <Camail> also it came to light that pretty much everything i thought liquid fucked up on was correct
19:41:51 <Camail> they brought in two awpers, simple was like wtf
19:42:17 <Camail> and he has no reason to sacrifice so much of his life and family for a team that just brought in this kid who can only awp
19:47:14 <DoT`> someone left liquid?
19:48:23 <Camail> s1imple did
19:48:30 <Camail> adren is back in for now
19:49:07 <Camail> liquid made a series of decisions then, by themselves aren't necessarily harmful, ended up collectively really hurting the team
19:50:43 <Camail> honestly on paper the team right now could do really good with a bit more experience and having koosta get his confidence back
19:50:59 <Camail> but with all the mental baggage and scarring this team has gone through in the last 2 months...i dunno
