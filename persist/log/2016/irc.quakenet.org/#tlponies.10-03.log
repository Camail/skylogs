00:54:44 <Camail> comp players play on low everything

00:55:44 <DuB> This is low everything AND 1280x720 AND 47% resolution scaling. :P

01:09:26 <Camail> pretty much
01:10:33 <DuB> Well.
01:10:39 <DuB> I COULD go home right now.
01:10:43 <DuB> But I kinda need $$$.
01:11:28 <Camail> become a prostitute
01:11:36 <Camail> get all that gay twink money
01:11:55 <DuB> 'Kay.
01:12:06 <Camail> any state as religious as utah has to have pent up closeted gay guys who are super rich
01:12:12 <Camail> they can be ur sugar daddy
01:15:08 <Dot`> pon pon pon
01:15:24 <Camail> that gf was kinda awful
01:15:35 <Camail> tons of execution errors and the footsies were really boring
01:15:41 <zkay> what?
01:15:49 <Camail> sf5
01:15:52 <DuB> (ZK has boring feet)
01:16:32 <zkay> ur just sayin that to be hurtful
01:16:34 <Camail> zhi speaks chinese, japanese, and english
01:16:36 <Camail> impressive
01:16:50 <DuB> Psh.
01:16:54 <DuB> Only 50% more than me.
01:17:31 <Camail> but he's fluent in japanese
01:17:36 <Camail> you said you werent
01:17:54 <Camail> also he is kinda rapey
01:18:00 <DuB> I AM CONVERSANT
01:18:03 <Camail> lul
01:18:14 <zkay> who is team expert?
01:18:28 <DuB> No idea.
01:18:32 <Camail> LOL SKI
01:18:35 <DuB> Byun's new team! :P
01:19:12 <zkay> oh scarlett's team apparently
01:19:21 <Camail> WHY IS THE CAMERA POSITIONED THAT WAY
01:19:25 <Camail> AWKWARD
01:19:26 <zkay> to annoy you
01:19:46 <Camail> it feels weird seeing my two communities interact
01:19:58 <Camail> and having no clue about the other
01:19:59 <zkay> ponies and fighting?
01:20:04 <Camail> I swear its just me and james bardolf
01:20:16 <Camail> 1. no, you guys are all awful at fighting games
01:20:19 <DuB> Pones are dead ZK, pls.
01:20:20 <Camail> 2. csgo and fgc
01:20:36 <zkay> you still watch
01:20:38 <zkay> and so does Dot`
01:20:42 <DuB> Who me?
01:20:46 <DuB> I haven't seen a pony in months!
01:20:52 <DuB> I'm convinced they're extinct.
01:21:03 <zkay> Dot`, does dub not watch anymore?
01:21:14 <Dot`> i told you he is bad
01:22:00 <Camail> yea tlp is like, just dot and phear
01:22:01 <DuB> Hey, when (if) I do finally catch up, I'll have LOTS to watch. :D
01:22:04 <DuB> All the better.
01:22:24 <DuB> I also keep forgetting to watch the last 3 episodes of the last Korra...
01:22:34 <Camail> tbf its kinda the show's fault
01:22:48 <Dot`> http://billneigh.deviantart.com/art/Princess-Shipping-637167673
01:22:49 <Camail> a lot fo people stopped watching, myself included, because they didn't like the new episodes
01:23:08 <Dot`> just like korra
01:23:31 <DuB> TLA >>>>>>>> korra
01:23:34 <Camail> I still maintain episodes 1-9 of korra is the best animated show I've ever watched
01:23:54 <Dot`> korra first few seasons and last season where great
01:23:59 <Camail> i hated the end of every korra season tho
01:24:31 <Camail> i just cant say that too loudly or people will call me a homophobe
01:24:45 <Dot`> lol
01:25:22 <Camail> amon should never have had bending, korra shouldn't have fucked all 3 of her friends, the second season shouldn't have happened
01:25:47 <Dot`> korra was only 3 season right?
01:25:50 <Camail> the animation quality never did get back tot he first season standards
01:25:52 <Camail> 4 i think
01:26:07 <Camail> ya 4
01:26:07 <Dot`> i know one of the middle seasons was god aweful
01:26:16 <Dot`> otherwise it was nice
01:26:44 <Camail> it was 2
01:26:53 <Camail> the changes animation houses
01:27:05 <Camail> and then split the narrative between tensin and korra
01:27:21 <Camail> tbf the end of season 1 fucked over the entire season 2
01:27:49 <Camail> because BAM she instantly becomes avatar and can do energy bending bullshit and sees all the other avatars
01:27:56 <Camail> also she's dating mako
01:27:59 <Bio> I honestly can't remember most of any plot details from any season
01:28:01 <Bio> is that bad
01:28:02 <Camail> also AMON WAS A FUCKING SUPER BLOOD BENDER WHY
01:28:04 <Camail> WHY
01:28:19 <Dot`> bio http://ncmares.deviantart.com/art/Twalot-637897424
01:28:35 <Camail> WHY NOT MAKE HIM A NORMAL GUY SO WE WERE ACTUALLY FORCED TO CONFRONT THE SCHISM BETWEEN BENDERS AND PEOPLE
01:28:42 <Camail> fuck me tho, right
01:29:09 <Camail> sigh
01:29:25 <Dot`> it was sad
01:30:34 <Camail> I mean, the suicide was provoking but I'd trade that for a real confrontation
01:34:04 <Camail> like why not have korra unable to bring back their bending for a season, just let those ripples play off each other
01:34:17 <Camail> they should've spent one more season in the city
01:37:48 <Camail> ugh did they mess with the twitch api
01:38:03 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/camail
01:39:12 <Camail> the new twitch update might've fucked it up
01:45:05 <Dot`> i agree
01:46:01 <Dot`> dub http://imgur.com/gallery/A4wHj
01:49:37 <DuB> :o
01:50:23 <Camail> oh no its something else
01:50:40 <Camail> they are essentially gonna make anyone wanting to call their api have an account
01:50:53 <Camail> they've bene periodically testing it out, must be doing that right now
01:51:20 <Camail> tfw you are looking for an answer and find R1CH asking the same question
01:51:36 <Bio> what a guy
01:53:00 <DuB> Hahaha.

02:10:37 <Camail> they need to fix that scaling
02:10:46 <Camail> its off by like an inch
02:13:21 <DuB> Yeah, the new top bar is awful.
02:14:10 <Phant> Can't you use the old version?
02:14:19 <Camail> i dnt think so
02:14:22 <Bio> pushing that theater mode 
02:14:31 <Camail> you can use the flash player still but not the old layout
02:14:47 <Bio> i don't care about whatever streamer's banner
02:15:13 <Bio> I know waht channel i'm watching
02:15:18 <Camail> they did a really really good thing with removing /profiles from the site
02:15:29 <Camail> because that was just a confusing click
02:15:42 <Camail> but the layout is like 6/10

21:45:51 <skram> I've listened to it at least once a day since you linked it like a month ago
21:45:58 <DuB`> LOOOL
21:45:59 <DuB`> Hahahaha
21:46:00 <DuB`> <3
21:46:03 <DuB`> It is
21:46:05 <DuB`> THE
21:46:06 <DuB`> Best
21:46:11 <Runbunny> Time to watch season 2 of pants-less planes for legs gun shooting air battles with magic.
21:46:31 <Runbunny> Glad you both liked it.
21:46:53 <skram> I tried blasting it in my car but its so much better if you look at the video too
21:48:06 <DuB`> Ranban wat.
21:48:54 <skram> Its one of those japanese cartoons he likes, Dub. pants-less planes is a very common trope you know.
21:49:05 <DuB`> Oh.
21:49:07 <DuB`> 'Kay.
21:49:52 <Runbunny> "planes for legs"
21:50:10 <skram> hold on
21:50:16 <skram> pants-less planes
21:50:21 <skram> that are also legs
21:50:27 <DuB`> !!!
21:50:42 <skram> that is also a gun
21:50:43 <Runbunny> They are not wearing pants so they can wear planes for legs.
21:51:05 <skram> so planes for legs and pantless
21:51:05 <Runbunny> Translates roughly to every scene being a pantsu shot.
21:51:25 <skram> ...explain
21:51:36 <DuB`> LOL
21:54:35 <Runbunny> let me find you some pictures.

21:56:20 <Runbunny> Dub drinks? O:
21:56:33 <DuB`> Only CIDER CIDER.
21:56:37 <skram> cider doesnt have to be alcoholic though
21:56:39 <skram> and also
21:56:40 <skram> wtf anders
21:56:59 <DuB`> LUL
21:57:02 <skram> why do they not have pants
21:57:10 <skram> why are their legs planes
21:57:22 <Runbunny> Because they can't wear the propeller legs with pants on.
21:57:26 <skram> why do they hace cat/fox/bunny ears
21:57:45 <skram> why do they have guns
21:57:47 <Runbunny> Because the leg planes require magic to operate.
21:57:57 <DuB`> ULU
21:58:02 <skram> this is the worst military unit i have seen
21:58:02 <Runbunny> The guns are for shooting down the enemies.
21:58:22 <Runbunny> anime ears are a sign of magic usage.
21:58:31 <Runbunny> or rather side effect or something.
21:58:43 <DuB`> All proven science, skram.
21:59:15 <skram> im done
21:59:29 <skram> anime was a mistake
