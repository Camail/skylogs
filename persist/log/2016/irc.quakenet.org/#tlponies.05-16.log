00:55:29 <Camail> DoT`  where do you see that you need proficiency in medicine to stabilize
00:55:56 <Camail> anyone can make an attempt to stabilize
00:56:51 <carcinisation> laters tlp
00:56:59 <carcinisation> i'm gonna go comfort eat
00:57:00 <skram> gnight reifmannen
00:57:53 <DoT`> gnight reif
00:59:07 <DoT`> cam, you say that and i recall anyone can stabalize, i just recall you making me make a medicine roll, and you can only assist in tihngs you can normaly do
00:59:16 <DoT`> which does normaly mean you have to be proficient
00:59:25 <DoT`> but for stabilising that would be anyone
01:02:59 <skram> ????
01:03:11 <DoT`> ?????
01:03:13 <skram> i mean you can make any skill check regardless of proficiency?
01:03:31 <DoT`> there are some you cant, i am pretty sure
01:03:45 <skram> im like 67% sure you're wrong
01:06:55 <DoT`> pg 174
01:07:40 <DoT`> im reading atm
01:07:43 <skram> doesnt say anything about needing to be proficient
01:08:25 <DoT`> im possibly recalling an old set of rules for it
01:08:54 <skram> proficiency in skills only give you a bonus to skill checks though
01:11:23 <DoT`> hmm, you cant use things without proficnecy in the related skill, eg medicine kit, there is that
01:17:12 <DoT`> zk https://www.twitch.tv/zealothockey
02:04:48 <Camail> DoT`  anyone can make a medicine roll
02:04:57 <Camail> anyone can make any skill check
02:05:09 <Camail> in order to stabilize you must roll medicine
02:05:15 <Camail> just like you roll insight for conversations
02:08:50 <Camail> as for the healer's kit, you dont need medicine proff to use that, either
02:09:07 <Camail> it gives you a 100% stabilization chance without having to roll
02:14:10 <Camail> also another note; there are three travel speeds, 18/24/30 for stealth/normal/fast
02:14:49 <Camail> you can also do a forced march, where every hour you roll for exhaustion
02:14:49 <Bio> asdf
02:18:36 <Camail> also jumping in part of movement, read up on it if you care, which you probably should

06:49:28 <Camail> .tellm zk dot` dub` phearlock skram | also you can now announce your damage is non lethal after you do it, but not after I've already marked him off as dead (which usually takes a few seconds) make sure to ask how hurt enemies look before you attack them if you have non-lethal in mind. It's a bit of a speed bump when we have to revert deaths because no one was paying attention to the enemies' health.

06:57:45 <Camail> .tell skram also yea even though both are rituals you still require the components of the spell, this case being verbal and somatic, so unless you tried to hide it, you are clearly doing or casting something right in front of them
06:58:27 <Camail> these types of rules are crucial to make magic user not be objectively better than non-magic users
06:59:52 <Camail> i just can't, in good consciousness, ignore something like casting a spell without anyone else noticing even for the sake of RAF. In world consistency is extremely important to me
07:00:02 <Camail> that being said I should've allowed the spell being cast to be a surprise round
07:00:20 <Camail> but it was an oversight that i will remember to not make in a future session

19:08:59 <DuB`> Runbunny: Just was getting to it.
19:08:59 <Camail> you'll forget your own names by then
19:09:41 <Camail> also dub tfw you could afford more spells if bardum didnt horde the gems
19:10:00 <Camail> you got a nice random encounter with one of the evocation wizards
19:10:04 <Camail> but had 0 funds
19:10:07 <Camail> RIIIIIIP you
19:10:53 <Runbunny> O:
19:11:13 <skram> imma dwarf
19:11:15 <Pearlock> eh his selection of lvl 1 spells is ok so far.
19:11:16 <skram> i see shiny rocks
19:11:21 <skram> what can u do
19:11:25 <Pearlock> Just get some money for lvl 2 and 3
19:16:48 <DuB`> Yah, they were meh!
19:17:23 <Pearlock> not really looked at the 5e list of spells
19:17:32 <Pearlock> but usually the really good stuff starts coming at lvl 3
19:17:39 <Pearlock> (spells, not character level)
19:17:52 <Pearlock> though plenty of useful things in spell lvl 1 and 2
19:25:33 -!- DoT|Phone [~Dot@0541c64f.skybroadband.com] has joined #tlponies
19:27:18 <skram> blizzard are the bestest at game cinematics
19:27:57 <Camail> many lvl 1 and 2 spells have additional effects, usually damage, when cast at higher levels. but they do start getting fun at lvl 2
19:28:11 <Camail> level 1 spells are pretty plain, witch bolt is really nice tho
19:28:17 <Pearlock> yeah
19:28:17 <DuB`> Got dat one.
19:28:28 <Camail> if it hits it gives the wizard a free d12 of damage every round
19:28:47 <Pearlock> lvl 2 has some great utility and defensive options
19:29:08 <Camail> witch bolt cast at level 3 does 3d12, which I'd say is pretty nice
19:29:16 <Camail> its the opposite of aoe
19:29:31 <Camail> where you are very specifically dealing with one problem
19:30:23 <Camail> OH
19:30:26 <Camail> the initial damage icnreases
19:30:30 <Camail> not all the damage
19:30:31 <Camail> ok less broken
19:30:54 <Camail> so the first hit does nd12, then additional d12 on the following turns
19:31:53 <Pearlock> Sometimes I miss the absolutely broken magic of Baldurs gate 2
19:32:04 <Pearlock> But man that was silly and stupidly op
19:32:22 <Pearlock> But fun
19:32:29 <Camail> butt fun
19:33:27 <Camail> if i ever play as a player I cant wait to multiclass
19:33:28 <Pearlock> Mainly stuff like spell triggers, sequencers, contingency spells.
19:33:35 <Camail> seems so fun
19:33:44 <Camail> I want a battlemage more than i should
19:34:00 <Pearlock> Sure lets be able to fire multiple spells in a single turn
19:34:15 <Pearlock> that don't use any slots if you prepared them beforehand
19:34:29 <Camail> you can still do multiple spells to some extent, but it is crazy limited in 5e
19:34:39 <Pearlock> Yeah it's been limited for good reason
19:34:41 <skram> multiclassing seems hilarous
19:35:22 <Pearlock> Awwwww cloudkill doesn't instantly kill enemies that have less than x hit dice anymore
19:35:24 <skram> if you're like a barb/bard, dragging out a fucking ukulele mid-rage to play a song to inspire something
19:35:32 <Camail> i kinda want to start as a fighter to get all the weapon/armor profficiencies, go into a spellcaster class for the rest of the levels and pick up warcaster at caster level 4
19:36:27 <Camail> scimitar in one hand, focus in the other until character lvl 5, then put a shield on
19:36:36 <Camail> so much ac and spell casting
19:36:48 <Camail> greenflame blade all the things
19:37:20 <Camail> also i thank god no one here uses that spell
19:37:28 <Camail> its like the MOST misunderstood spell inthe game
19:37:33 <Camail> that and booming blade
19:38:25 <skram> seems pretty straightforward to me?
19:38:48 <skram> if you hit a dude with your sword, a dude next to it takes fire damage?
19:39:54 <Camail> lets say you have TWF
19:40:02 <Camail> or are a monk
19:40:07 <Camail> or have an extra attack
19:40:12 <Camail> do you know how they interact?
19:40:19 <Camail> or a reaction AOO
19:40:32 <Camail> or another move that has a melee weapon attack
19:40:41 <Camail> which is NOT equivalent to a melee weapon making an attack
19:41:08 <skram> whats twf
19:41:13 <Camail> two weapon fighting
19:41:37 <Camail> if you use your attack action to make ana ttack with a light weapon, you may make another atack with a different light weapon
19:41:45 <Camail> there is a feat to remove the light conditional
19:41:54 <skram> Yeah
19:41:55 <Camail> i cant recall off hand if that uses the bonus action
19:41:58 <Camail> i believe it does
19:42:08 <skram> You use an action to attack something and fire happens?
19:42:13 <Camail> wrong
19:42:14 <skram> id assume it doesnt trigger from bonus attacks
19:42:20 <skram> well
19:42:23 <skram> casting it is an action
19:42:44 <Camail> in twf you must use the attack action
19:42:54 <Camail> gfb use the Cast a Spell action
19:43:05 <Camail> with a requirement that you must make a melee atack with a weapon
19:43:28 <DuB`> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.
19:43:31 <DuB`> THE GENJI/HANZO SHORT.
19:43:35 <DuB`> WAHOHOWHOWAHHWHWW.
19:43:48 <Camail> and we are currently talking in a context where you know that people misunderstand it so you are actively trying to figure it out
19:44:00 <Camail> imagine the people who just read the spell, come to a conlusion, then try and use it that wa
19:44:01 <Camail> y
19:44:05 <Camail> which is a lot of people
19:44:16 <Camail> and all of the DMs of those players tweet the devs
19:44:55 <skram> i dont get it
19:44:58 <skram> casting a spell is an action
19:45:00 <DoT`> i napped for 10 minutes and drooled on my pillow
19:45:07 <skram> does that mean the spell gives you an attack action aswell?
19:45:10 <DoT`> naps are bad
19:45:11 <Camail> no
19:45:31 <Camail> part of casting the spells is to make a melee weapon attack
19:45:36 <Camail> which is not an attack action
19:45:44 <skram> ????
19:45:46 <Camail> you make weapon attacks when you schoose the attacka ction
19:45:54 <Camail> this makes sense when you know about extra attacks
19:46:01 <Camail> at lvl 5 you gain an extra attack
19:46:07 <skram> yes i understand that
19:46:20 <Camail> this means that, when you take the attack action, you are allowed to make a second attack in that attack action
19:46:27 <skram> yes
19:46:38 <Camail> so ana ttack action is the vehicle that attacks are in
19:46:54 <Camail> they are ntot he same thing, because the things that happen within an attack action are working in a different way
19:47:15 <Camail> a standard action can be multiple things, two of them are the Cast a Spell action and the Attack action
19:47:33 <Camail> gfb requires that you use Cast a Spell action to use it
19:47:42 <Camail> TWF requires that you use the Attack action
19:48:08 <Camail> so while both result in a melee weapon attack, only the latter triggers TWF and allows you to do a bonus action
19:48:45 <Camail> also
19:48:53 <Camail> the gfb roll does not use spell attack modifiers
19:49:19 <Camail> because you are actually using the melee weapon attack as a part of the spell, you roll to hit with that weapon, using all of it's stats
19:50:13 <Camail> its a rather weird spell
19:50:21 <skram> so basically, you cant use gfb with things that trigger extra attacks
19:50:29 <skram> like twf or barb stuff or monk stuff
19:50:40 <skram> or rather, you dont get any extra attacks
19:52:01 <Camail> any combat feature that says it requires the attack action does not trigger from gfb
19:52:06 <Camail> monks for example:
19:52:27 <Camail> When you use the Attack action with an unarmed
19:52:27 <Camail>  strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make
19:52:27 <Camail>  one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
19:52:39 <Camail> copy pasting from this pdf is annoying
19:52:43 <skram> ya i get it
19:53:05 <Camail> a lot of things are worded like that to avoid broken synergies
19:54:24 <Camail> it doesnt prevent you from frenzy raging for a second attack as a bonus action tho, because there isn't any requirement besides being in a frenzied rage
20:04:46 <Camail> man next session is gonna be so fun
20:05:27 <skram> Yeah lets insult some fuckin ponce and then almost die again
20:05:42 <skram> maybe defile some giant birds
20:06:07 <Camail> stick ur dick in it

22:38:12 <Phearlaptop>  butt!
22:38:13 <skram> dot go to bed
22:38:15 <skram> you are unwell
22:38:48 <DoT`> i am in bed
22:38:55 <DoT`> phear pls...
22:39:06 <skram> oh
22:39:08 <skram> carry on then

22:39:51 <Phearlaptop> dot
22:40:08 <Phearlaptop> There was a cute pony butt
22:40:16 <Phearlaptop> don't deny it
22:40:33 <DoT`> Is that actually what your paladin worships?
22:41:18 <Phearlaptop> No while I wanted something easy to RP I didn't completely copypasta my interests.
22:41:25 <Bio> lel
22:41:26 <skram> weak
22:41:45 <Bio> I've always done ranger in dnd
22:41:55 <Bio> wanna do barb or some other melee class
22:41:57 <Bio> next time
22:42:02 <DoT`> Fighter is great
22:42:08 <skram> barb is fun
22:42:16 <Phearlaptop> I'd have done a fighter I think, but party kinda needed some extra heals.
22:42:22 <skram> i just go in there and hit things with swords, dont have to think about anything
22:42:23 <Phearlaptop> And pally is close enuf
22:42:42 <skram> because tactics is for characters with depth, im just a raging barbarian remember
22:43:00 <DoT`> Battle master is very cool fighter thing
22:44:04 <DoT`> yea phear, outr party really needed more heals
22:44:19 <Camail> considering at the moment, sans corso you have 2 healing potions
22:44:20 <DoT`> especialy now bard is gone
22:44:31 <skram> how did you afford all that dot
22:44:43 <skram> thats a hundred gold worth of potions
22:44:45 <Camail> thats everything he has now
22:44:47 <DoT`> well you might notice i dont have a tux
22:45:08 <Camail> it costs 25 to make
22:45:08 <Camail> there's an advantage to making things yourself
22:45:08 <skram> thats some shitty priorities
22:45:22 <skram> spend 40g on a tux or use all of them on flowers and shit?
22:45:31 <Phearlaptop> I wanna get some crafting skill next time I make a char.
22:45:42 <Phearlaptop> Fucking amazing excuse for when you literally have no idea what to do.
22:45:46 <Phearlaptop> "I'll go make thing"
22:45:50 <DoT`> haha
22:46:00 <Camail> crafting skills are interesting, but i ultimately dont quite understand how well they integrate with stuff
22:46:06 <Camail> partly because it takes awhile to make stuff
22:46:08 <skram> Crafting just seems like a waste of time unless its potion making honestly
22:46:09 <Camail> like, quite awhile
22:46:29 <Camail> non-magic things it takes cost/5 days to make something
22:46:35 <skram> I can do blacksmithing stuff but I have the weapons I want that are non-magical
22:46:49 <skram> and magical items are hella expensive and takes years to make
22:46:58 <Camail> no they dont
22:47:31 <Camail> non-consumable weapons dont take terribly long by default
22:47:31 <Camail> the rules for how long are GREATLY dettermined by the dm
22:47:31 <Camail> but I'm going with default
22:47:59 <Camail> common items are 100 gold and 4 days
22:48:09 <Camail> uncommon (like +1 weapons) are 500 gold and 20 days
22:48:20 <skram> where'd you find that
22:48:24 <Camail> its in the dmg
22:48:33 <Camail> rare and upwards are irrlevant
22:48:35 <skram> all the tables ive looked at it takes fuckin years
22:48:38 <Camail> that starts being 1+ years
22:49:04 <skram> like plate armor is 300 days and some gold
22:49:19 <Camail> thats plate
22:49:24 <Camail> magical stuff is enchanting
22:49:44 <Camail> non-magical vs magical is an entirely different system
22:49:46 <skram> fair enough
22:50:08 <Camail> and plate is just insanely high tier
22:50:19 <Camail> and incredably expensive because of that
22:50:40 <Camail> I would never get plate for any of my characters anyone
22:50:44 <skram> do we have anyone who can do enchanting then
22:50:48 <skram> vanessa maybe
22:50:51 <Camail> unless part of the enchantment was to move silently
22:51:00 <Camail> any spellcaster with slots can do it
22:51:10 <Camail> privded they have the slot relevant to the item
22:51:24 <Camail> simple +1 enchantments are easy to do
22:51:33 <Camail> but bigger, more powerful things might have additional requirements
22:51:38 <Camail> like a mini quest
22:51:45 <skram> like reagents?
22:52:06 <Camail> every day you work on enchanting you must expend a spell slot of required level
22:52:11 <Camail> yea, like special stuff
22:52:16 <Camail> or simply the blueprints themselves
22:52:19 <Camail> complex ancient weapons
22:52:28 <Camail> stuff like that is intersting loot
22:52:40 <DoT`> can you not use ritual thing so it doesnt use a spell slot?
22:52:57 <Camail> but yea, you would also need to prepare the relevant spell that you are enchanting it with, or at least one of the people working on the item must do that
22:53:01 <Camail> no dot
22:53:06 <Camail> it must use a spell slot
22:53:17 <Camail> you arent casting the spell

23:33:10 <Phearlaptop> dank
23:33:19 <skram> that hanzo animation is pretty fuckin baller tho
23:33:24 <skram> despite the overall shittyness
23:34:10 <DoT`> skram, you are being grumpy again
23:34:58 <DuB`> Wow skrma.

23:35:21 <Camail> I'mm ammake fun of all of you overwatch fucbois
23:35:21 <skram> I dont think you dudes understand words
23:35:34 <Camail> despite the overall shittyness
23:35:37 <Camail> those are words
23:35:38 <DuB`> ...
23:35:50 <skram> ok fine maybe i need to practice some words then
23:35:58 <Camail> "it looks good despite fucking sucking donkey dick"
23:36:05 <Camail> "what i said it looked nice!"
23:36:07 <skram> i mean, its deliberately bad
23:36:11 <skram> which makes it funny
23:36:17 <Camail> ?
23:36:23 <Camail> now i dont think you undestand
23:36:29 <skram> the action sequence?
23:36:42 <Camail> a fun way to show their abilities
23:36:57 <Camail> it was choreographed well
23:37:08 <Phearlaptop> I thought it was cool
23:37:58 <skram> https://youtu.be/RnNOa1cQgBc?t=57 ?
23:37:59 <Camail> being predictable doesn't mean bad
23:38:00 <skram> ???
23:38:22 <Phearlaptop> Exactly
23:38:26 <Phearlaptop> I am very predictable
23:38:35 <skram> excellent choreography
23:38:56 <Camail> its a nice short that shows a bit of lore about the characters, foreshadows about the world, and shows off evreything about both characters
23:39:05 <Camail> what is bad about that
23:39:15 <Camail> do you wnat a story to not be told just because it doesnt surprise you
23:39:26 <DoT`> skram seems to be talking about the joke version? maybe?
23:39:32 <Camail> oh
