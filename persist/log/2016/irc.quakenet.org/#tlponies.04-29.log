00:24:17 <DoT`> dub, why dont you ever beat up cam in fighting games
00:24:50 <DuB`> I haven't felt like fiting in a while, I dunno. :T
00:25:55 <DoT`> its a shame you where busy with exams when we started dnd :(
00:26:27 <Camail> he didnt want to commit to time, but honestly he can join if he really wants
00:26:32 <Camail> probably not next session
00:26:35 <DuB`> I have never dnd'd! :O
00:26:38 <Camail> but in tw sessions is a perfect time
00:26:42 <Camail> neither has skram or dot
00:27:05 <Camail> but after this next session will have the easiest transition if you want to play
00:27:46 <Camail> though i dont want to dm for more than 5
00:28:00 <DoT`> cam, i should have been a snarky fighter and just been my sarcastic self, so much easier :P

01:24:12 <DuB`> Dunno!
01:24:17 <DoT`> !!!
01:24:17 <DuB`> Haven't gotten that far, yet...

01:28:30 <Camail> race*
01:30:04 <Camail> hmmm
01:30:09 <Camail> should he be lvl 1 or 2
01:30:22 <DoT`> ouch
01:30:32 <Camail> probably 2?
01:30:38 <Camail> its only 300 xp, seems w/e
01:30:49 <Camail> and lvl 2 doesnt give you many choices to make like lvl 3 does
01:31:01 <DoT`> i think 2 is fine
01:31:49 <Camail> dub you dhould go to the first page of chapter 3

01:43:21 <DuB`> Wizard spell prep and slots are confusing.
01:44:46 <Camail> prep?
01:44:53 <Camail> like components to spells?
01:46:03 <Camail> oh i see
01:46:10 <Camail> lemme read the section and summarize
01:47:40 <Camail> ok so there are spells that you have in your book, and then there are spells you prepared
01:47:59 <Camail> the spells int he book are the only ones that you can possibly cast ever, until you write more in there
01:48:06 <Camail> preparing a spell is done at the beignning of a day
01:48:28 <Camail> where you select a specified number of spells based on the spell's difficulty (its level)
01:48:38 <Camail> those are your prepared spells, the ones you can actually use
01:49:12 <Camail> so there is a list of spells you are able to cast, and then a subset of that are your daily prepared spells
01:50:34 <DuB`> Aight.
01:59:29 <Camail> oh
01:59:33 <Camail> you pick oyur arcane tradition level 2
01:59:42 <Camail> and get nothing lvl 3, lul
01:59:48 <Camail> well, ntohing new
02:00:16 <DoT`> dub pics most complex class
02:07:51 <Camail> kinda, but its manageable
02:07:59 <Camail> he has 4 days to do it so thats more than enough time
02:08:24 <Camail> the hardest part will be picking a picture
02:11:40 <DuB`> :O
02:15:22 <DuB`> Also gender.
02:15:24 <DuB`> ;D
02:15:41 <DuB`> Heck, if I go with a lady I could just use the D3 wizard lady as picture!

16:50:50 <skram> I feel like totem thing might be a bit more useful
16:51:33 <DoT`> i like the look of totem over rage
16:51:35 <skram> The frenzied rage is pretty good but it gives you a point of exhaustion

17:32:47 <DoT`> haha
17:32:51 <DoT`> poor unicorn
17:34:50 <Camail> he doesnt really need to know that many rules to be functional
17:35:14 <Camail> understand the kinds of actions in a turn, roll checks that I tell him to
17:35:18 <Camail> and class specific stuff
17:35:25 <DuB`> Yah.
17:35:40 <DuB`> What was ZK's person, again?
17:35:47 <DuB`> Ladywizard something?
17:35:49 <Camail> movement, action, bonus action, item interaction
17:35:50 <Camail> warlock
17:35:54 <Phearlock> Warlock yeah
17:35:57 <DoT`> 5
17:36:00 <DuB`> Ah.
17:36:12 <DuB`> So I can be a ladywizard and not overlap tooo much. :P
17:36:13 <Phearlock> Tl;DR shitty wizard but can cast more often.
17:36:42 <Phearlock> (terrible tldr, there are other differences)
17:36:46 <Camail> yea you can be a wizard dats fine
17:37:01 <DoT`> cam wants us ded
17:37:12 <Camail> you guys are so squishy
17:37:21 <DoT`> yip
17:37:36 <DoT`> we could do witha cleric or palidin D:
17:37:46 <Camail> dub doesnt want to paladin tho
17:37:58 <DuB`> Heavens no.
17:38:32 <DoT`> yea, if dub doesnt want to be either of those im sure we can manage, skram will just have to tank harder and roll more 12's for health
17:38:45 <DuB`> ez
17:38:48 <Phearlock> you guys do tempt me a lot into trying to get into the dnds again, but you don't think we'll have too many ppl?
17:38:48 <DoT`> whats wrong with palidin?!
17:39:13 <DuB`> Paladin is not a wizard, dot.
17:39:14 <DuB`> You see.
17:39:24 <DoT`> what about cleric?
17:41:05 <Camail> the party is in an awkward position composition wise
17:41:24 <Camail> which is mostly your guys' fault
17:41:28 <Camail> aka 100% ur fault
17:41:38 <DoT`> lol
17:42:49 <DoT`> i mean i could have gone fighter/clerc, but really, we have a tank, caster, (whatever a bard is) and me
17:43:01 <DoT`> like a bard doesnt really cover the range/casting role
17:43:37 <Camail> bard is a good support class
17:43:45 <Camail> and micen picked support things
17:44:07 <DoT`> yea, so i mean as a 4, i tihnk we are ok
17:44:07 <Camail> you have a tank, dps, mage,and support
17:44:10 <Camail> which is fine
17:44:19 <Camail> so now that i think about it
17:44:26 <Camail> it's probably fine
17:44:47 <Camail> tho tbh i think that skram would like bear path more
17:44:55 <DoT`> but adding an extra, if he is squishy, it might tip us that way a bit
17:44:55 <Camail> based on the combat we've had
17:45:11 <Camail> DoT`  adding anything to a balanced team will imbalance it in that way
17:45:17 <Camail> adding a tank makes you beefier but slower
17:45:19 <Phearlock> Yeah they'll be a bit heavy on the casting with a second caster. But can play around that by artificially playing with the CR a little bit.
17:45:52 <DoT`> or dub can focus abjuration i think it was
17:45:55 <Camail> I'm not gonna tailor encounters to the party composition
17:45:56 <Camail> dot pls
17:46:00 <DoT`> shield/negating school
17:46:00 <Camail> let him do his thing
17:46:07 <Bio> pan
17:46:08 <Camail> dont backseat drive
17:46:30 <Camail> I want dub to pick something he thinks is cool
17:46:36 <DoT`> i was just thinking out loud on mechanics, but will stop talking
17:46:46 <Camail> no thats fine
17:46:52 <Phearlock> Mages do become really flexible once they get a couple levels anyway.
17:46:57 <Camail> its just phrasing is important
17:47:29 <DuB`> I was just gonna go "nuke everything" as much as possible. >.>
17:47:42 <Camail> thats not really a thing?
17:47:46 <Camail> like, there' aoe attacks
17:47:48 <Camail> but those hit everyone
17:48:15 <Phearlock> You already have party feuds
17:48:28 <Phearlock> bit of friendly fire AOE couldn't hurt
17:48:57 <Phearlock> Try not to do that.
17:49:01 <Phearlock> =D
17:50:18 <DuB`> AOE NUKES
17:50:49 <Camail> ok so dub isnt playing
17:50:55 <DuB`> D:
17:51:37 <Camail> https://app.roll20.net/join/1375189/xcx54Q
17:51:42 <Camail> for dub and phear
17:52:20 <Camail> also dub you need to pick arcana prof
17:52:27 <Camail> cuz everyone here is bad at that
17:52:52 <Phearlock> ?dnd
17:53:04 <Phearlock> hm, where were the links to all the 5e stuff
17:53:21 <Camail> ALSO I kinda like the idea of being able to use the traditional stat array, but you dont have to you can do the 4d6 drop and swap that we did with everyone else
17:53:37 <Camail> its still something I'm reading/figuring out
17:53:53 <Camail> but luckily stats dont matter as much as in game decisions in dnd 5
17:53:56 <DoT`> traditional stat array?
17:54:12 <Camail> 15,14,13,12,10,8
17:54:16 <Camail> you choose where they go
17:54:34 <Camail> its a slightly below average roll
17:54:47 <Camail> it engenders uniformity
17:54:49 <Camail> which i hate
17:54:52 <Camail> and game-yness
17:54:54 <Camail> which i ahte even more
17:55:01 <Camail> but its stable and reliable
17:55:50 <DoT`> ok, my roll was slightly better than those stats, so ok
17:56:26 <Camail> lol
17:56:34 <DoT`> :P
17:57:36 <Camail> skram https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/2165351/working-rage-damage-toggle/?pageforid=2173174#post-2173174
17:57:38 <Camail> this may be a thing
17:57:41 <Camail> I'll look at it too
17:57:50 <Camail> but there might be a way to put a rage toggle in the character sheet
18:03:33 <Camail> also you guys need the princes of apocolypse player suppliment
18:06:23 <DuB`> Ack.

18:21:20 <Phearlock> Right good just making sure I found the right thing.
18:21:45 <Camail> yea i got it confused with the supplement that I need
18:21:50 <Camail> you guys get a companion
18:21:57 <DoT`> does that mean one can play the race in there as well?
18:22:06 <Camail> the genasi, ya
18:22:16 <Camail> that's what I played in our 4e game

18:31:48 <Camail> regretssssss
18:32:58 <Camail> tho honestly i dont think her character makes much sense in 5e, or at least its not as good
18:33:11 <Camail> the class i was in determined a lot of her character and amde it mean something
18:33:36 <Camail> now her obsession with greatswords wouldn't be anymore meaningful than kyza's obsession with daggers

18:39:40 <ZK> oh right, i think i remember that
18:39:50 <Camail> where decim fucked up SO HARD

18:40:03 <ZK> seepi seems dead
18:40:05 <ZK> destroyed
18:40:15 <ZK> not just bloodied or unconscious, just dead.

19:39:41 <Rawr|Fone> I am drinking tonight
19:50:07 <DuB`> Much DnD reading.
19:50:09 <DuB`> Wahhh.
19:50:34 <Camail> any questions?
19:50:36 <Phearlock> You know it dub
19:51:26 <DuB`> Naw.
19:51:43 <ZK> why is dub reading dnd
19:52:35 <Phearlock> Me and dub decided the stream quality was too poor
19:52:47 <Phearlock> and had to join the game instead
19:52:58 <ZK> but you never said anything :o I could have fixed.
19:53:03 <ZK> But na, i prefer you joining anyhow
19:53:29 <ZK> watcha gonna make?
19:53:34 <DuB`> ZK I DID tell you about the audio.
19:53:43 <ZK> well yea, after the stream was over for 2 hours
19:53:47 <DuB`> ;P
19:53:49 <Phearlock> Paladin! Not sure on race though, Human or Half-orc
19:53:59 <ZK> oh shit, someone taller than me :o
19:54:15 <ZK> any good backstory?
19:54:28 <Phearlock> I am accepting suggestions
19:54:36 <Camail> butts
19:54:41 <Camail> king of butts has given you powers
19:54:53 <Phearlock> Sworn an oath to skrams butt
19:54:58 <DuB`> Ladywizard who is power hungry and vengeful in a righteous sort of way, perhaps. :)
19:55:38 <ZK> you think you are the law and want to exercise justice EVERYWHERE
19:55:48 <ZK> another girl :o
19:55:59 <DuB`> NAMES are always the hardest part...
19:56:00 <Runbunny> DID YOU SAY MEGUMIN !?!?!?!
19:56:16 <DuB`> ???
19:56:49 <ZK> howbout a paladin that failed everywhere and just wants to redeem himself!
19:57:06 <Runbunny> enjoy DuB` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-On0u96Vv4
19:57:16 <ZK> you goin for wizard dub? 
19:57:19 <Camail> Phearlock  my suggestion is that you figure everything out mechnically first,t hen make a story based on that
19:57:28 <Camail> if you dont already have a preference that's usually the best way
19:57:37 <ZK> oh, and roll your dice to see your stats
19:57:40 <Phearlock> I did
19:57:45 <ZK> so you can decide why your paladin is a complete idiot
19:57:45 <Phearlock> I got really good rolls
19:57:46 <Camail> you have to pick domain and stuff so you get even more resources to draw from
19:57:51 <Camail> they were pretty good rolls
19:58:30 <ZK> WTF ARE THOSE ROLLS
19:58:33 <DuB`> Runbunny this is the MOST anime thing.
19:58:33 <ZK> thats like anti-skram
19:58:49 <Camail> anti 1st skram
19:58:53 <Camail> skram's back up has those rolls
19:59:13 <ZK> his lowest is 12. holy cow
19:59:39 <Runbunny> I was going to find a video about megumin but I found that one and got distracted.
20:00:36 <ZK> 16 and 18.... thats just... you're gonna tank everything
20:00:47 <Camail> he switched dex for cha
20:00:52 <Camail> heavy armor doesnt use dex bonus
20:01:22 <Phearlock> Starting with chainmail so, 16 AC from the start anyway, though -5 ft movement.
20:01:33 <Camail> and shit stealth
20:01:35 <Phearlock> yes
20:01:42 <Phearlock> Armor too shiny
20:01:46 <Camail> cling clang
20:02:05 <Phearlock> (historically, chainmail isn't very loud at all though unless you're running)
20:02:21 <Phearlock> But hey it says disadvantage so
20:02:24 <Phearlock> it's disatvantage
20:02:37 <ZK> it makes you slow and kinda unwiedly tho
20:02:40 <Phearlock> yes
20:02:58 <Phearlock> But unless I want to spend money on some other armor that's what I'm stuck with early on
20:03:01 <Phearlock> so will go with it
20:03:18 <Camail> it all evens out int he end
20:03:50 <Phearlock> If the others want to run in front they can, it's not my fault if they get stuck in melee and have to run behind me
20:04:30 <Phearlock> Oh, what do I get for starting hitpoints? Is the first roll maximized?
20:05:01 <Camail> yea its max roll + con
20:05:39 <Camail> then for each level you can choose to roll or take the parenthetical number in the class description
20:05:50 <Camail> skram rolled and got max again
20:05:52 <Camail> it was sick
20:06:00 <Phearlock> I remember
20:06:07 <Phearlock> What a guy
20:07:47 <ZK> so if you a half orc, you already maxed out your strength at first level :o
20:08:43 <Phearlock> Right the +2 will apply at lvl 1 to bring str to 20?
20:08:57 <ZK> yep
20:09:00 <ZK> and 20 is the max in 5e
20:09:26 <Phearlock> Swearing an oath of lifting.
20:11:28 <Camail> To the god of leg day
20:21:10 <Camail> .tell skram I figured out a way to add rage damage into the dmg calculation. Make an attribute called "rage_bonus" or something similar, set it to 2, then in the damage on your weapons add {@rage_bonus} into your damage. You can put the rage_bonus variable on your token next to hp to easily change it.
20:22:12 <Camail> .tell skram its not the best solution but it works, i can do it for you if you want,, considering its mostly for my benefit
20:22:36 <DuB`> Gonna need some help with character creation after I get through all this first. >.>
20:22:56 <DuB`> So many abilities and modifiers and proficiencies and stats and rolls and ????
20:23:30 <Phearlock> Using the character sheet camail gave you on roll20.net helps a lot. It fills in a lot of modifiers and such for you
20:23:36 <Camail> yea dub
20:23:38 <Camail> use dat
20:23:47 <DuB`> Mhm.
20:23:59 <Camail> it calcualtes everything it can
20:24:07 <Camail> putting in you stats does 80% of the works for you
20:24:32 <Camail> its int he journal tab, thridt icon fromth e left at top of chat
20:25:29 <Camail> also this seciton is useful for everyone https://wiki.roll20.net/5th_Edition_OGL_by_Roll20#Dynamic_References_to_Repeating_Sections
20:26:00 <Camail> the only problem with spells is that it doesnt work with spells that need attack rolls
20:26:15 <Camail> there is no way to do that in the spells section, so you would have to put it in the attacks and spellcasting section
20:27:35 <Camail> %{selected|repeating_attack_$0_attack} is probably the most useful macro
20:27:44 <Rawr|Fone> No
20:27:51 <Camail> you can change "selected" with the name of your character
20:28:06 <Camail> so that you dont need to select the token
20:29:46 <Camail> lol zk wtf is up with your staff
20:29:54 <Camail> you put d6/d8 in the damage field
20:30:02 <ZK> one handed vs two handed
20:30:21 <Camail> thats not what the field is meant for :P
20:30:32 <Yolteotl> I'm 55 points away from top8 master :d
20:30:32 <Camail> it divides the two rolls
20:31:03 <DuB`> Yolteotl gogogo!
20:31:05 <Yolteotl> <3
20:31:11 <Yolteotl> I should stream more
20:33:27 <DuB`> Camail I need the character sheet again. Forgot to bookmark that.
20:34:58 <Runbunny> DoT`, apparently someone wrote this book http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62772.I_Am_a_Cat
20:37:12 <Camail> DuB` ? its in roll20
20:39:31 <DuB`> Um.
20:39:56 <Camail> um?
20:40:31 <Camail> https://app.roll20.net/join/1375189/xcx54Q is the link to roll 20
20:40:40 <Camail> the sheet will be in the journal
20:41:48 <DuB`> Journal...
20:42:17 <Camail> third button from the left
20:42:19 <Camail> above the chat
20:42:23 <Camail> well
20:42:27 <Camail> first make a roll20 acocunt?
20:42:31 <Camail> ont even see you in the web site
20:43:44 <DuB`> Oh, you have to enter game.
20:43:47 <DuB`> Gooooootcha.
20:44:18 <Camail> Yup
20:44:24 <Camail> character sheets are isolated to a campaign
20:45:46 <Camail> also go into settings and change ur name in the game so its easier for us
20:46:11 <DuB`> Yeah.
20:46:16 <Camail> JayDub
20:46:18 <Camail> is ur new name
20:47:24 <Camail> it says "char sheet" but thats where your name will go when you figure it out
20:47:38 <Camail> DoT` i figured out why i can fuck with you wihle you look at your sheet
20:47:52 <Camail> those buttons for core and spell are actually tied to an attribute that shows the current page
20:48:32 <Camail> so by changing pages you change the attribute for the sheet itself, meaning that anyone looking at the sheet and "editing" that attribute will change it for everyone
20:50:48 <Camail> DuB`  have you rolled your stats yet
20:50:55 <DuB`> No.
20:50:57 <DuB`> I'm still reading!
20:51:02 <Camail> reading which part
20:51:09 <DuB`> The Rules of Magic.
20:51:17 <Camail> you cast spells
20:51:17 <DuB`> Spellsssss
20:51:29 <Camail> you  cast a spell, it happens or it doesnt
20:51:30 <Camail> bam
20:51:32 <Camail> das it

20:52:30 <DoT`> phear, you got good stat rolls?
20:52:31 <Phearlock> Tiny little cardboard ones.
20:52:33 <DuB`> That sounds splendid.
20:53:06 <DuB`> So.
20:53:19 <DuB`> Eh, never mind. Later!
