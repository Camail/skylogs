20:18:17 <motbob> what if we did multiplayer
20:18:30 <Camail> i was almost assuming we would
20:18:52 <motbob> well i'm not going to "beat" the game and then play it again with a friend
20:19:06 <motbob> can we just make a pact to chill until multiplayer comes out
20:19:36 <Camail> I mean, I already did basically everything, but truth be told there isn't much content after year 1
20:19:43 <Camail> by the time multiplayer happens I'm fine with that
20:19:50 <Camail> I don't want to play until then anyway
20:21:02 <Camail> the problem is, how will we divvy out the wives with multiple people

22:31:25 <Runbunny> Multi coloured cats.
22:32:28 <DoT|Phone1> are they human like?
22:33:35 <Runbunny> well the multi colour of calico cats is due to random X-chromosome inactivation.
22:34:32 <Runbunny> if there's a male cat which is multi coloured it's sterile, due to have 2 X chromosomes and a Y chromosome.
22:34:51 <DoT`> poor kitty
22:35:07 <DoT`> so your saying i should not paint cats?
22:37:57 <Runbunny> Well you can paint them with ca friendly paint, but like, some ship paint, has a lot of elements that is protagonistic for estrogen receptors.
22:38:11 <Runbunny> That would fuck the cat will up.

23:29:20 <Camail> Something, somewhere will be named Boaty McBoatface by the end of this
23:33:05 <CockRoach|42> if the company agrees on the name
23:33:53 <DoT`> it will probably end up being given as a second name or unoficial name to the boat
23:37:08 <CockRoach|42> yeah :/

23:41:27 <Wikt> not for like a normal reason, either
23:41:47 <Wikt> it's just because i find playing pretend games with inanimate objects too offputting on an irrational level

23:44:43 <reification> enjoy your ignorance skram. in this case it is certainly bliss
