01:59:39 <Bio> ERTH SAVED
02:00:00 <DuB`> !!!
02:00:52 <Phearlock> yay
02:00:56 <DoT|Phone> huzzah
02:01:08 <ZK> dub so good
02:01:11 <Bio> ALSO HOLY FUCK THAT LAST ROOM
02:01:14 <Phearlock> Last mission is fun, if a bit of a stomp until the end =D
02:01:20 <ZK> xcom?
02:01:23 <Phearlock> Last room was tricky
02:01:43 <Bio> I void rifted the first pod
02:01:51 <Bio> one of the insanities mindcontrolled something
02:01:56 <Bio> activated ALL THE THINGS
02:02:54 <Bio> psi is so good for that mission though
02:03:05 <Bio> free sustain, broken abilities
02:03:21 <Phearlock> ...I didn't bring any psi operatives on that one at all except the one you get for free.
02:03:31 <Bio> Gabriela "Vader" Cortez  is my hero
02:03:32 <Phearlock> Very conventional of me xD
02:03:57 <Bio> my sniper did work also
02:04:10 <Bio> ez 6 shots
02:04:14 <Bio> all day err day
02:05:57 <Phearlock> I don't think I had any stars in the last mission.
02:06:04 <Phearlock> Just everyone pulling their thing.
02:06:58 <Bio> there was a cool moment when I pulled the 8 or so mecs
02:07:09 <Bio> I had dot capacitor overcharge
02:07:15 <Bio> wiped the entire pod
02:07:52 <Phearlock> 8? I only had like the 4 MECs at the start
02:08:08 <Phearlock> They were all on the catwalks. lol.
02:08:10 <Bio> I ran into a big pod of em
02:08:26 <Bio> idk, maybe it was because I was further along in the game
02:08:37 <Bio> timewise
02:08:43 <Phearlock> maybe!
02:09:00 <Bio> there were a few nasty pods
02:09:16 <Bio> a Sectopod, 2x andro, 2x muton gave me trouble
02:09:36 <Phearlock> I had a sectopod+2 MEC + 4 muton pod
02:09:37 <Bio> also an 8xLid + gatekeeper
02:09:59 <Phearlock> That one was fun, but everyone was on OW when it triggered
02:10:03 <Phearlock> So... didn't go well for it
02:10:07 <Bio> rekt
02:10:25 <Bio> sniper with bluescreen rounds just trivializes sectopods 
02:10:34 <Bio> even with full armor
02:11:09 <Bio> also the war suits are awesome, if only for the powered weaps
02:11:15 <Phearlock> I had 2 gunners, 1 loaded up with acid nades.
02:11:25 <Phearlock> Armor was not a problem =P
02:11:36 <Bio> god acid nades are kickass
02:11:42 <Phearlock> My favorite
02:11:50 <Bio> -4 armor AND a sick debuff? thanx
