16:08:59 <Cane> Just an announcement trailer, no gameplay.
16:09:10 <Cane> So it's them saying, "You know that game you all know we're making? We're making it."
16:09:25 <Cane> But apparently they have Sean Bean.
16:09:38 <DoT`> ded game?

16:11:43 <Cane> There's three screenshots here.
16:11:47 <Cane> It looks like a mobile game.
16:12:13 <DoT`> its worrying but its VERY early alpha screenshot maybe?
16:13:14 <Cane> I'd say definitely not. That used to be the case where dev shots really WERE subject to change, but in today's day and age where every pixel is a chore to create and render? For a AAA studio, whenever they release anything, what you see is pretty much what you're going to get.
16:13:36 <DoT`> i can dream cane!
16:14:13 <DoT`> this might help cane http://imgur.com/gallery/fs2sQ
16:14:22 <Cane> Well. Hopefully the gameplay is still good and people get their time and money's worth. The aesthetics aren't appealing to me, so we'll see.

16:49:01 <Cane> I figured they'd switch things up a bit.

16:49:40 <Camail> which works

17:01:06 <Camail> elige was trapped behind big box, should've repositioned way earlier but it was too late
17:01:23 <Camail> had to watch 2 angles, made a read that mid would make contact, guessed wrong
17:01:54 <Camail> adren was trapped at default, had to watch tunnel with no cover and didnt have an angle on door to keep elige safe
17:02:00 <Camail> which was the reason elige had two angles t look at
17:02:07 <Camail> adren didnt have a choice, elige kinda did
17:03:09 <Camail> nitro should've cleared tunnel, but it was a minor mistake, nip was really clever
17:03:28 <Camail> i didnt have sound on but i bet the second guy didnt even shoot

17:05:28 <Camail> wow ok
17:05:31 <Camail> tl get a solid kill
17:06:03 <Camail> get right played really weird
17:06:18 <Camail> he was just hoping they would fuck up and no one would watch the flank
17:06:33 <Camail> little sign of either him being reckless or disrespect
17:07:00 <Camail> where was this in the last half

17:07:04 -!- mode/#tlponies [+v reimeuk] by Q
17:07:06 <Camail> hello?
17:07:13 <Cane> Hi.
17:07:34 <Camail> LOL
17:07:35 <Cane> lol
17:08:38 <Camail> that cz tho
17:08:48 <Camail> aww, he thought he killed him
17:08:48 <Cane> Aw.
17:08:50 <Cane> Same.
17:08:54 <Cane> I was sure he had.
17:08:57 <Cane> And then lolno.
17:09:02 <Camail> had to make that call though, couldnt afford to waste bullets
17:09:15 <Cane> I keep doing that in FPS games, dunno why.
17:09:45 <Cane> I don't even go "wtf he should have died," I just go "why do I keep DOING that?"
17:10:04 <Camail> i do that when i think I'm dead on him so i resolve to pull away after the 6th bullet
17:10:18 <Camail> because he should be dead and I'm just like >_>
17:11:00 <Camail> if tl doesnt win this ot I'm gonna be so sad
17:11:07 <Camail> if they 4-0 it I am gonna be so happy
17:11:12 <Camail> that means a lot for a team
17:12:58 <Camail> so many flashes
17:13:11 <Camail> i think people have figured out that awp placement
17:13:29 <Camail> 3 rifles saved is really important for CTs in OT
17:13:42 <Camail> if they lose this round they can still buy 3rd round
17:13:53 <Camail> OT3 with 10k, specifically
17:15:34 <Camail> they got faked out by the cross smoke on a soooo hard
17:16:14 <Camail> thats big
17:16:18 <Cane> Hmmm
17:16:19 <Camail> they have full b side control
17:16:25 <Camail> threatening the flank
17:16:32 <Camail> nvm
17:16:40 <Camail> they all died
17:16:42 <Cane> lol nice spray.
17:16:42 <Camail> while i was typing
17:17:16 <Cane> NIP just won't die.
17:20:00 <Camail> mid guy fucked upt hat round
17:20:13 <Cane> Ugg, he really wanted more than just 1 kill.
17:20:13 <Camail> he repeeked against two people he saw
17:21:43 <Cane> Awww.
17:21:55 <Cane> I was hoping he'd clutch that.
17:22:01 <Camail> well koost had no idea he was there
17:22:05 <Camail> koosta*
17:22:08 <Camail> he "checked it"
17:22:09 <Cane> Of course.
17:22:13 <Camail> but he wasnt focused
17:23:25 <Cane> They choked so hard in regular. =/
17:23:53 <Camail> gg
17:23:56 <Cane> It's done.
17:24:21 <Camail> they choked 4-5 crucial rounds on their t half
17:24:25 <Cane> Yeap.
17:24:28 <Camail> its disappointing
17:24:30 <Camail> but w/e
17:24:49 <Cane> Ugh. Sad.
17:24:51 <Runbunny> lel
17:24:52 <Camail> the biggest choke was round 17
17:24:53 <Cane> GG NIP.
17:25:02 <Camail> we didnt get to see the kills
17:25:05 <Runbunny> just tuned in for the sad ending.
17:25:19 <Cane> I tuned in right as NIP began the comeback. TL was about to win.
17:25:20 <Camail> but like any b-tier team they're t side is kinda bad
17:26:05 <Camail> that 3v3 they had on b site was depressing
17:26:18 <Camail> it wasnt a choke they just got fucked
17:26:33 <Camail> nitro would've had to have god sense to clear tunnels for the second guy
17:26:59 <Camail> elige got the call that 1 was dead in tunnels so he was fine playing big box, but as soon as nitro died he was pinned
17:27:36 <Camail> the best spot for him to play would've been back plat if they wanted to be super safe, but big box has extremely versatile angles
17:27:47 <Camail> if you can keep tunnel control its the best spot on the map
17:28:44 <Camail> that entire round hinged on that weird tunnel play by nip
17:29:11 <Camail> elige played greedy though
17:29:38 <Camail> the Ts had to wait such a long time to plant, he should've migrated to back plat just because the CTs had so much time to set up
17:30:43 <Camail> if elige gets to back plat, he trades with nitro, elige clears tunnels, adren can move onto site, they can take the 2v1 together
17:31:39 <Camail> but if they make contact on doo instead of tunnels, adren gets killed, elige is trapped back plat, nitro is busy fighting in tunnels, and you set up 3 1v1s as Ts post plant
17:31:44 <Camail> which is bad
17:32:12 <Camail> and mid is the most likely entry point beause of fast rotations
17:32:37 <Camail> but sadly TL waited for waaaaaay too long to plant the bomb and gave them time to do w/e they wanted
17:32:44 <Camail> that may be the real mistake by tl
17:33:08 <Camail> DoT`  that game lasted way longer than i thought, gonna shower and eat cuz hungry
17:36:29 <Cane> Back. Less sad about TL now but still miffed at the choke.
17:40:53 <DoT`> liquid pls

17:55:42 <DoT`> DUB <3
17:55:57 <skram> hej dubles
17:58:15 <Runbunny> Hei.
17:59:10 <DuB`> MAKE A-MEI-RICA GREAT AGAIN.
17:59:10 <DoT`> skram, i forgot to increase my hit points on my monk now we lvl 3
17:59:14 <DuB`> DOT <3
17:59:22 <DuB`> skarm, runbun!
17:59:28 <DuB`> I MISS TRACER.
17:59:37 <skram> Maybe you should, DoT`.
17:59:44 <DoT`> what you really miss is merct dub
17:59:48 <skram> Now you can handle two attacks!
17:59:56 <skram> Dub I never even saw you play tracer.
18:00:01 <DoT`> i always had 2 attacks skram
18:00:01 <skram> Dont you mean Genji?
18:00:12 <skram> i meant against you, dot
18:00:21 <DuB`> skram, both of my highest-elim games of the week were as tracer.
18:00:24 <DoT`> only once you hit things
18:00:31 <DuB`> (Both on Nepal. :P)
18:00:36 <DuB`> Tracer is the god of nepal.
18:01:27 <skram> I only had like 4 heroes with more than 1 hour of play
18:01:31 <skram> out of like 30 hours total
18:01:41 <DuB`> Oh you.
18:02:35 <Runbunny> The tracism is too real. 
18:02:43 <Camail> oh and dot it popped into my head and makes perfect sense, the alternative to crazy dagger town is to skip out on the d8 with the spear and only use it one handed, have a dagger in your off hand and never attack with it (cuz you can't) and thats it
18:02:55 <Camail> the only thing dropping a dagger does is let you use the versatile die
18:03:19 <Camail> i still like crazy dagger town the most tho
18:03:21 <Camail> its a great town
18:03:23 <Camail> lots of parties

20:54:02 <DoT`> gg
20:54:04 <Camail> they fucked us super hard, then they over extended and wiped

21:42:23 <Camail> spell swapping might be their fetish

23:12:03 <DoT`> you should have gone other barbarian route then skram
23:12:11 <DoT`> in your rage you might kill small aniamls
23:12:38 <skram> dikdik wasnt a thing for totem warriors on the PHB
23:12:42 <skram> might have to homebrew it

23:26:23 <DoT`> the dream!
23:26:35 <Phant> Best I did in the beta was 2 people.
23:26:42 <Phant> I wish I had everyone grouped up like that haha.
23:26:48 <DoT`> i had a round where i got 8 in total
23:26:51 <Phant> Best way to take care of Reinhardt on that map.
23:26:56 <Bio> boop'd
23:27:07 <DuB`> GOODBYE TEAM.
23:27:10 <DuB`> Haaahahaha.
23:27:29 <Phant> I also love Trobjorn MVPs http://imgur.com/HXng69V
23:27:43 <DoT`> the legend
23:27:46 <skram> Lucio is stupid good
23:27:57 <DuB`> PotG of the game.
23:28:36 <skram> We did 2 lucio 2 winston 2 tracer on attack and we won every match
23:28:38 <skram> it was amazing
23:29:00 <DuB`> Hey, that's nearly the googleme meta.
23:29:01 <Bio> skrma stahp hacking
23:29:10 <Phant> More Lucio fun https://gfycat.com/ZigzagJealousIrishredandwhitesetter
23:29:10 <DuB`> Just replace tracers with reapers. :P
23:29:14 <DoT`> tlp refused to do any funny comps, everyone just kept picking thier own things D:
23:29:35 <Camail> tlp is bad at games, we all know this
23:29:51 <skram> Hey we did pretty good actually
23:29:51 <Bio> rip
23:29:53 <DuB`> Hey, I'm ready for 5mei any day.
23:30:04 <DoT`> you never suggested it dub
23:30:06 <skram> nah
23:30:06 <Bio> I beat a pro player sooo
23:30:08 <Bio> Kappa
23:30:08 <DoT`> when i asked
23:30:08 <skram> 6mercy
23:30:16 <DuB`> 6mercy chainheals~
23:30:18 <Phant> I did 6 Winston, triple Hanzo, and 5 Genji.
23:30:20 <skram> HEROES NEVER DIE HEROES NEVER DIE HEROES NEVER DIE
23:30:29 <DuB`> LITERALLY IMMORTAL
23:30:34 <DoT`> we had that 1 with 4 genjo, 2 lucio
23:30:42 <DoT`> but the randoms failed dub and i
23:30:46 <DuB`> Which went well for ONE point.
23:30:47 <Phant> The best combo, a pair of Reinhardt+Mercy+Bastion on Temple of Anubis defense.
23:31:00 <Phant> Reinhardt so the Bastion can't get picked off or hooked by Roadhog.
23:31:03 <DuB`> Phant that's just mean.
23:31:04 <Phant> and Mercy so nobody dies.
23:31:10 <skram> Rude
23:31:37 <DoT`> we saw a fair amount of that combo
23:31:39 <Phant> http://67.media.tumblr.com/dea31dd62b60f0b6ea499c9d47a72131/tumblr_o6xjml0udh1r9i3yao1_1280.jpg
23:31:43 <DoT`> its mean
23:31:57 <DuB`> Genji still does fine against that.
23:32:03 <skram> Yeah until you pick phara and fly above them and ulti them to death because they are idiots who dont look up
23:32:06 <skram> or behind them
23:32:17 <DuB`> You can just jump into their emplacement and break everything.
23:33:51 <Camail> junkrat lobs hit at their heads, i imagine
23:34:10 <DoT`> junkrat was my go to for getting past defences
23:34:12 <DoT`> and for defence
23:34:18 <Camail> if he's anything like the demo, arcing spam is great against pubs
23:34:19 <DoT`> he is great :P
23:34:23 <DuB`> Yup, if you can find a good angle.
23:34:52 <DoT`> i did find junkrat far better on defence than attack
23:34:57 <Camail> the one thing that i dont like about overwatch is getting credit for kills
23:34:58 <DoT`> so many triggers
23:35:00 <Camail> the way they do it is weird
23:35:03 <Camail> there arent any assists
23:35:10 <skram> Yes there is
23:35:12 <skram> or rather
23:35:17 <DoT`> annihilitions are assists
23:35:22 <DoT`> and kills are kills
23:35:22 <skram> There isnt a stat for kills
23:35:28 <skram> just for combined kills or assists
23:35:32 <Camail> eliminations w/e
23:36:47 <Camail> they mash them all up in the kill streaks so its like.... just pandering
23:37:09 <DoT`> it helps ppl play the objective
23:37:14 <Camail> i saw seagul get a potg because another guy killed 2 people at the same time but he did 40%, then killed another guy
23:37:17 <DoT`> a real improvment on things like battlefield
23:37:31 <skram> Yeah I think its a good thing to make kills not matter as much
23:37:46 <Camail> nothing will change pub's desire to kill
23:37:48 <skram> And the POTG algorithm is fucking weird sometimes
23:37:51 <Camail> that's not gonna happen ever
23:38:14 <Camail> now people just feel better because their stats are padded
23:38:33 <skram> whats the downside? :p
23:38:51 <Camail> even more ambiguous, less helpful stats
23:39:54 <skram> eh i just dont think it matters
23:39:59 <Camail> in csgo if you get 5 kills and 10 assists that means something a lot more than 15 kill/assists
23:40:06 <Camail> kills/assists isnt even good enough
23:40:09 <Camail> for spectators or players
23:40:17 <Camail> i think its a step in the wrong direction
23:41:09 <DoT`> well there is a stat for killing shots and percentage of team damage done
23:41:35 <DoT`> but your far less likly to do 100% damage to someone that in cs
23:42:45 <skram> I just dont think its very comparable considering the wide variety of weapons that do different amounts of damage to people with a wide variety of HP and with classes that have different abilities and strong points
23:43:15 <skram> like, knowing that you solo killed x amounts of dudes doesnt seem helpful at all
23:43:30 <skram> i mean you know how much you healed or how many damages you did or how long you stayed on a point
23:44:09 <skram> CS is a completely different game and I feel most comparisons to it are just wrong
23:44:16 <Camail> I'm saying that their replacement is bad because its just a watered down version, and int he history of gaming no one said kills meant 100% solo
23:44:39 <Camail> obviously there are bad things about the raw finishing blow stat
23:44:52 <Camail> but their solution isn't useful
23:45:03 <Camail> I'm not comparing it to csgo
23:45:06 <skram> why is a watered down version not useful
23:45:12 <Camail> whats usefula bout it
23:45:19 <skram> how is it less useful
23:45:19 <Camail> its even less useful than kills
23:45:34 <Camail> because there are even MORE isntances where you get credit for that stat that you don't deserve
23:45:39 <Camail> or are insignificant
23:46:11 <Camail> there are already holes in the final blow version of the kill stat that dont represent your impact, but this goes too far in the other direction, where everyone gets something
23:46:46 <skram> yeah its dumbed down and sorta casual which is what blizzard does to every game that isnt starcraft
23:46:52 <skram> i just dont think it matters at all
23:47:06 <skram> so you make some dudes feel good about a bigger number
23:47:17 <Camail> you dont care
23:47:18 <Camail> I do
23:47:25 <Camail> you have no point toher than "i dont care"
23:47:34 <skram> i just dont understand why you do
23:47:37 <DoT`> what stats do you want cam?
23:48:05 <Camail> i dont have an idea, I'm not a game designer, you don't need a positive theory in order to criticize another theory
23:48:56 <Camail> i guess i care about the actual impact a person has, and actively fudging numbers bothers me because i care about the objective worth of what your doing
23:49:09 <Camail> and something that inflates that, that gives people the illusion of succes without the material, bothers me
23:49:22 <Camail> if it doesnt bother you w/e
23:49:31 <DoT`> ther eis the % of team damage done, % of damage healed, numbers of damage blocked and shields used
23:49:39 <skram> eh, fair enough
23:49:41 <DoT`> there are a bunch of diffrnet stats for each hero
23:50:07 <DoT`> the end of game kills number is just infalted to make ppl feel good
23:50:11 <DoT`> but the other data is there
23:50:32 <Camail> yet the stat people always care about, the kill count, is inflated
23:50:36 <Camail> thats the stat everyone cares about
23:50:40 <Camail> pubbies focus on it
23:50:45 <DoT`> I will admit of it doesnt show up in the cards at the end i have no idea where you look, i assume in stats, but i never checked
23:51:42 <Camail> all that info can be there in a button next to vods in the archive for all it matters, but its no coincidence that they took the most desired stat and fudged it
23:52:38 <DoT`> i see damage healed upvoted as much in the cards if not more than damage done often
23:52:57 <DoT`> they have created support clsses ppl actually seem to care about
23:53:48 <Camail> thats what other people want for other people, they are glad their support did well
23:53:53 <Camail> but for them, the players goal during a match
23:54:13 <Camail> everyone who isn't a support? what do they want for themselves?
23:54:41 <Camail> upvotes are for other people and don't really give us an understanding of what players want to do, just what they value in others
23:54:46 <Camail> namely, getting healed/supported
23:54:59 <Camail> which is still pretty ego-centric, which is inherent in every pub
23:58:31 <Camail> i have no ill-will towards the game, i just happen to have an extremely unbiased 0 passion perspective, so I'm going to nitpick if i see something i dont like, which isn't very often
23:59:31 <Camail> I'm gonna make an npc called Mersee Healmen
