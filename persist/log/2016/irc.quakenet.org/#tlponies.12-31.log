10:31:51 <DoT|Phone> moocen
10:32:08 <Micen> You calling me a cow?
10:32:18 <Micen> is it because i am a fat, filthy, american?
10:32:24 * Micen cries in a corner.
10:32:56 <DoT|Phone> it's because you live in farmlands. but you can take it how you want
10:33:07 <Micen> this is true. 
10:33:34 <Micen> and actually, i am less fat! I have lost a bunch of weight in the past month.
10:33:42 <CockRoach|42> \o/

10:34:07 <CockRoach|42> spelling is hard
10:34:25 <DoT|Phone> you lost weight over Christmas. well done
10:34:35 <Micen> I had... 3 cookies. 
10:34:37 <CockRoach|42> that is quite impressive
10:35:22 <Micen> I do think a lot of it was stress and being sick over that time. But ill take the weight loss any way that I can.
10:35:48 <DoT|Phone> take what you can get
10:36:32 <DoT|Phone> now just start going for daily walks

10:43:22 <Micen> and its really good pay too!
10:43:28 <Micen> like near double any other job i have had .
10:43:47 <Rawr|Fone> That sounds great
10:44:19 <Micen> it does. 
10:44:51 <Micen> When they give me my job, I can be debt free in like 4 to 6 months. 
10:47:07 <Rawr|Fone> Good
10:47:13 <Rawr|Fone> I'm proud
10:47:48 <Micen> then I can buy doughnuts from my old job and send them to euroland.
10:47:56 <DoT|Phone> was the pizza good Rawr
10:48:45 <Rawr|Fone> I haven't had any today
10:48:53 <Rawr|Fone> Not ordered food yet
10:49:15 <Rawr|Fone> But I don't know if it's any better than ours
10:49:36 <Micen> you are at the origin of pizza. 
10:50:40 <Rawr|Fone> Well that doesn't mean it's the best
10:51:27 <DoT|Phone> no matter how worse it is. it's better Rawr
10:51:33 <DoT|Phone> that's how you be fancy
10:52:17 <Micen> i dont know if we can trust dot to be fancy
10:52:21 <Micen> .is dot fancy?
10:52:30 <DoT|Phone> it's true
10:53:47 <DoT|Phone> but when I was young we where rich and I was brought up knowing fancy things
10:53:55 <DoT|Phone> now I'm this

10:58:24 <Rawr|Fone> I don't think that's how it works dot
10:59:10 <DoT|Phone> Rawr snela. trust me on this if you want to be fancy
10:59:35 <Micen> Dot you can only compare fancy to friends.  and I am American so that means i am way less fancy than you are.
10:59:54 <DoT|Phone> also the fact none of us can prove you wrong adds to your story Rawr
11:00:41 <DoT|Phone> have you seen south Africans Micen. we are not slobs. but we are also certainly not fancy
11:00:47 <DoT|Phone> rustic maybe
11:01:01 <Rawr|Fone> Since we have already established that you are not fancy, I think we should listen more to what I say
11:01:14 <Micen> of course I have! I've listened to Die Antwoord
11:01:39 <DoT|Phone> well if you wish to seem uncouth Rawr. go ahead!

16:42:14 <skram> what do weird danish people eat on new years Runbunny
16:43:18 <Dot`> duck
16:43:33 <Runbunny> usually some potatoes and some meat, steak or a roast. but it varies a lot
16:43:43 <Runbunny> I don't think anyone eats duck.
16:43:48 <Dot`> lies
16:43:49 <skram> moose steak?
16:43:51 <Runbunny> not for new years.
16:43:58 <Runbunny> There are no moose in this country.
16:44:18 <Dot`> A traditional Danish dinner at Christmas eve consist of roasted duck or pork, served with boiled potatoes, Danish sugar browned potatoes, Danish red cabbage, ...
16:44:26 <Dot`> are you even danish?!
16:44:41 <skram> we are talking about new years dot!

18:57:32 <Crisium> so many christmas skins i need
18:58:41 <Cane> I buckled. Have Overwatch now.
18:59:29 <Crisium> welcome to the club
18:59:33 <Crisium> i gave in last month
18:59:45 <Crisium> how are you Cane?
19:00:15 <Cane> Pretty good. <3 New years is going well. I have cake! Will have to run off and do family things soon.
19:00:20 <Cane> How about you? =)
19:00:46 <Crisium> good here too.  will overwatch now and then party later
19:02:42 <DoT|Phone1> oooo. be cane
19:02:47 <DoT|Phone1> nice
19:04:17 <Cane> Any reason not to install OW to Program Files?
19:04:28 <Cane> I guess that's the modder in me asking.
19:04:40 <Dot`> i have mine on my main drive because its my only ssd
19:04:54 <Dot`> i dont tink i have heard of any need, as with most games
19:05:24 <Cane> Just wondering re: admin permissions etc, I usually install games outside of Program Files if I know I'm going to modify them somehow. Skyrim is a prime example.
19:05:47 <Cane> But I imagine OW works 100% fine even in that folder, like 99% of games.
19:06:21 <Cane> Oh, it's only 6GB. That's pleasant.
19:06:32 <Cane> I've been installing a lot of sim games lately and they can be ridiculous.
19:06:55 <Cane> X-Plane is 33GB.
19:07:27 <Dot`> so many games nowdays are massive
19:07:41 <Dot`> BF4 - 60gb, Arma 3 - 50 gb
19:07:56 <Dot`> GTA 5 was also something like that
19:10:09 <Cane> Yeah it's insane these days.
19:10:31 <Cane> I had to uninstall Arma 3 because it was taking up infinity space on my gaming SSD.
19:11:43 <Dot`> now my 2tb HDD is dead im really short on space
19:12:56 <Dot`> i find blood bowl 2 to be a fun game to watch, maybe its how the rng always screws strippin over
19:13:04 <Cane> I still have like 4 separate drives and an external HDD on top of that, but the SSDs are always expensive as hell if you go beyond 256 or 512GB.
19:13:26 <Cane> Would love a 2TB or 4TB SSD but freaking hell.
19:14:24 <Runbunny> Dot`, Cane http://i.imgur.com/BmJs2Zi.mp4
19:14:28 <Dot`> oh yea, so expensive
19:15:15 <Cane> That dog is very happy. <3
19:15:36 <Dot`> i had at one point 4 250 gb, a 2 tb and a 250 ssd
19:15:43 <Dot`> now only 1 250 and the ssd
19:15:51 <Dot`> poor drives got old
