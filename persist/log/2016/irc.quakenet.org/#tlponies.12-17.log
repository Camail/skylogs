00:11:33 <ZK> life is strange gives feels
00:11:35 <ZK> dang
00:15:04 <skram> the worst feels
00:16:07 <DuB`> This sounds like a not good thing.
00:16:23 <ZK> you should play it
00:17:05 <skram> bae > bay
00:17:20 <skram> did you do all of it yet zeke
00:24:13 <Bio> bae bay
00:25:25 <Camail> holy shit
00:25:35 <Camail> twitch actually did picture in picture
00:25:39 <Camail> thats really neat
00:25:50 <Bio> Yeah, I just saw that
00:26:07 <Camail> they took a mobile feature and put it on th normal site, interesting
00:26:23 <Camail> also the new cheer emote thing is neat in concept
00:26:42 <Camail> still doesnt warrant 20% more of your money being taken away from the streamer tho
00:26:44 <Bio> must buy bits for mega-Kappa
00:26:53 <ZK> im in act 4 when they discover that thing
00:26:56 <ZK> still got a bit to go
00:27:07 <Camail> they need to add a lot more emotes into that, then a few more features
00:27:17 <ZK> hockeyyyyyyy
00:27:33 <Bio> icepuck
00:27:49 <Camail> ad bits are probably gonna be the future
00:27:57 <ZK> sharks are scary
00:28:04 <Camail> i wish that streamers were more honest with how much they get from bits
00:28:34 <Camail> its a very easy deflection tool to say "I get all the money from the bits i get, a bit is worth 1 cent"
00:28:52 <Bio> I think thats how it works, no?
00:29:00 <Camail> technically
00:29:12 <Camail> but they dont mention that you pay more for bits than 1 cent
00:29:28 <Camail> so you are actually paying a shit ton more, than 1 cent per 1 bit
00:29:32 <Bio> I think I heard moonmoon say that
00:29:42 <Camail> twitch takes a 27% fee
00:29:45 <Camail> once you do the math
00:29:56 <Camail> it only goes down to like 15% if you buy 10k
00:30:07 <Camail> or w/e the max purchase is
00:30:13 -!- motbob [~motbob@x-131-212-250-187.uofm-secure.wireless.umn.edu] has joined #tlponies
00:30:20 <Camail> its awful compared to paypal
00:30:36 <Camail> and so far, it isn't worth the extra fee, but they're trying
00:30:59 <Camail> you pay the fee up front when you buy the bits and not on each indvidual bit donation to streamers
00:30:59 <motbob> what now?
00:31:11 <motbob> oh
00:33:35 <Camail> i just don't like how easy it is to avoid talking about the fact that the streamer gets less money from donating 100 bits vs $1.40 through paypal
00:33:59 <Camail> it ends up being only 6 cents, but thats the lowest purchase, and even with paypal's flat rate fee its still worse
00:34:32 <Bio> yeah. best way to make sure strimmers get all ur monis is to donate to them
00:35:04 <Camail> yea, and unfortunately its easy for streamers to spin it the other way because of when the fees are detracted
00:35:08 <Bio> i'm ok with just havign my parents twitch prime
00:35:15 <Camail> like, extremely easy
00:35:58 <Camail> some people value the rewards more than me tho
00:36:07 <Camail> whales love the 10k and 100k badges
00:36:24 <Bio> twitch are charging for the service of bits (the animated kappas, the badges, ect.) but atm its worth to few peeps
00:36:47 <Bio> tried watchign ads for bits
00:36:51 <Bio> but takes forever
00:36:54 <Camail> but once you start incentivizing whales you start getting into moral gray areas
00:36:59 <Camail> there's a trick for wathcing the ads
00:37:12 <Bio> orly
00:37:15 <Camail> open up a stream, stop the steram, make that tab its own window, then watch it on mute
00:37:27 <Camail> it still plays the add even tho you are focused on that window
00:37:33 <Camail> arent*
00:37:37 <Bio> yeh, thats what I do, but its only letting me watch like 1 ad every like 20 mins
00:37:54 <Camail> i usually get like 3 in a row
00:38:04 <Camail> eh, its just something to do every so often
00:38:17 <Camail> and being able to turn a single ad click into 5-15 cents is actually insane
00:38:30 <Camail> when ad revenue is usually recorded in cents per thousand clicks? its fucking nuts
00:38:54 <motbob> ads that are clicked for bits shouldn't be muteable
00:39:02 <motbob> a rare exception to that rule
00:39:24 <Camail> they aren't neccesarily muteable
00:39:35 <Camail> but chrome lets you mute tabs because each tab is its own process
00:39:45 <motbob> oh ofc
00:39:53 <motbob> good point
00:39:56 <Bio> oh riiiiight
00:39:58 <Camail> and how do you even stop that
00:40:03 <Bio> assass creed comes out next week
00:40:39 <Camail> also at first i thought you meant mutable like, changeable
00:40:42 <Camail> and was very confused
00:49:26 <Bio> asdf
00:49:48 <Bio> hmm, now its letting me watch like 8 in a row
00:49:52 <Bio> oh wells

01:51:28 <ZK> as long as nothing happens to my boy warren
01:51:37 <ZK> hes gonna get the girl, i believe in him
01:51:54 <skram> It is kinda fun but the randomness of team composition makes saltiness probable

19:15:55 <DuB`> 2close
19:16:02 <Zounds> That's what I like to see right there
19:16:40 <skram> I dont think that was as close as it seemed
19:17:01 <skram> envy let them take it but the didnt lose control of it
19:18:09 <DuB`> It always surprises me how little pros care about dumping a bunch of damage into zarya shields.
19:18:19 <DuB`> I guess they'd rather just burn them down and go for the kills.
19:19:17 <skram> graviton+blizzard on 4 dudes and yet they failed to capture

22:41:02 <skram> and a symm
22:41:40 <DuB`> BAH
22:42:25 <reification> impressive runbun given that what i’ve read strongly suggests widespread iron overconsumption in men
22:43:20 <skram> overconsumption due to what
22:43:27 <skram> what foods contain iron
22:43:46 <DuB`> BLOOD
22:44:00 <reification> well meat does and in many countries flour in mandated to be fortified
22:44:06 <reification> *is
22:44:20 <DuB`> Charge -> high noon !
22:44:21 <skram> fortified with IRON?
22:44:57 <reification> also you don’t lose blood from parasites/hunting like in earlier eras
22:45:08 <Runbunny> meat, fish, stuff like dates and raisins is has alot of iron.
22:45:34 <skram> huh
22:48:05 <reification> make sure you drink the right stuff with food, fruit juice boots absorbtion, coffee blocks it
22:50:51 <Runbunny> tea and hot chocolate as well.
