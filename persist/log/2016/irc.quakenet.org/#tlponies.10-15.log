20:20:33 <Yolteotl> xD
20:20:43 <Yolteotl> that was "wow, whats happening?"
20:21:20 <Camail> .ponyv + s99e99 Test
20:21:39 <Camail> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
20:21:45 <Camail> ever closer
20:21:57 <Camail> its obviously not my code it msut be some 3rd party thing
20:21:58 <Dot`> odd
20:22:04 <Camail> if its ponycountdown I'mma be so mad
20:22:14 <Dot`> yea, your code hasnt changed and it stopped working
20:22:18 <Dot`> must be third party
20:22:27 <Dot`> skram, Runbunny  http://imgur.com/gallery/6cbIj
20:23:24 <Camail> if ponycountdown stopped completely that might explain it
20:24:03 <Camail> I use their episode list to generate episode objects and then put those in a database, then when adding a video it finds an episode and adds the link
20:24:04 <Dot`> that stopped working yesterday
20:24:10 <Camail> if it doesnt find the episode then it reurns that
20:24:19 <Camail> so ponycountdown might just be a dead website now
20:24:27 <Camail> or it might just be down
20:24:54 <Camail> .ponyv s06e23
20:25:13 <Camail> yea it just doesn't have a row for any more episodes yet
20:25:15 <Dot`> i think it got a bit messed up when the ep aired early
20:25:29 <Camail> the table has a lot more info that I never ended up using
20:25:48 <CockRoach|42> why would ponycountdown related to that problem?
20:26:20 <Camail> the way i coded it was supposed to open up options for more pony tools
20:26:30 <Camail> the ponyv command doesnt make table entries
20:26:36 <Camail> it hooks onto an already existing entry
20:26:41 <CockRoach|42> ah
20:26:54 <Camail> and if that row doesnt exist, it assumes the episode doesnt exist
20:27:16 <CockRoach|42> that's silly :(
20:27:28 <Camail> ideally i dont want to let any commands add rows outside the one i amde for it
20:27:46 <Camail> object oriented programming, yo
20:28:06 <CockRoach|42> error handling pls
20:28:09 <CockRoach|42> :)
20:28:26 <Camail> it handled the error, but this bot also doesnt have any built in error handling
20:29:05 <Camail> I'd have to make an error log myself if i wanted anything other than  what sweetie returns in the chat
20:30:01 <Camail> which is the biggest downside of this bot, and always has been
20:34:20 <Camail> well either way, we'll wait a few days to see if the site is just messed up or dead
20:34:30 <CockRoach|42> yeah
20:34:31 <Camail> if this was an unusual episode time then its probably just confused
20:34:50 <Camail> also went into the commetns on the site and to see if there was an update...
20:34:58 <Camail> found this gem "I hope there will be an episode about the trouble bronies have."
20:35:08 * Camail runs even further away
20:35:13 <CockRoach|42> haha
20:35:29 <Dot`> lol
20:35:42 <CockRoach|42> the trouble of bots not working properly
20:35:47 <CockRoach|42> #TheRealStruggle
20:37:32 <Phearlock> The only struggle is the lack of bestprincess eps
20:38:10 <CockRoach|42> dashie is not a princess, yet
20:38:24 <Phearlock> <.<
20:38:53 <Camail> if you told me they all turned into princesses by now I would believe you
20:39:03 <CockRoach|42> :D
20:39:13 <Phearlock> only in fanfiction camail
20:39:36 <CockRoach|42> do they usually contain someone's alicorn OC?
20:39:50 <Phearlock> uh, depends
20:40:12 <Phearlock> Most I have read do not, but I tend to shy away from that sort of thing =)
20:40:20 <CockRoach|42> good pon

22:46:30 <Camail> man wikipedia is a pain in the ass when it comes to how the list episodes
22:46:39 <Camail> or at least the people who maintain mlp episodes

23:57:02 <Dot`> Hey flutters
23:57:08 <Dot`> you saw pony today?
23:57:14 <FlutterAi> not yet
23:57:18 <FlutterAi> still re-downloading TESO
23:57:30 <FlutterAi> I've spent over 50 hours downloading this game now
23:57:34 <FlutterAi> fuck. my. life.
23:57:37 <CockRoach|42> http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4xlmn5
23:57:49 <CockRoach|42> because dot is most likely too lazy to find it
23:58:02 * FlutterAi wants to bash his head into a brick wall repeatedly at this point
23:58:12 <Dot`> i am known to be lazy
23:58:18 <CockRoach|42> yep
23:58:27 <FlutterAi> I have the EqD page for the episode post open
23:58:38 <FlutterAi> I just don't think I'll be able to stream it in decent quality until this finishes
23:58:41 <FlutterAi> or I pause it :P
23:58:48 <FlutterAi> but I WANT IT DONE ASAP, REALLY :'(
23:59:18 <FlutterAi> is today's episode a flutter episode Dot`? :o
23:59:33 <Dot`> no :(
23:59:38 <Dot`> but it is a good ep
