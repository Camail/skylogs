00:41:12 <Runbunny> I might have that.
00:44:12 <DuB`> I was led to believe that beds are somewhat more important for sleep than books are.
00:44:21 <DuB`> Could be wrong, but hey.
00:44:40 <DoT`> very wrong
00:45:10 <DuB`> Man.
00:45:12 <DoT`> i have hiked/camped a lot with no bed, but books really help to go to sleep
00:45:16 <DuB`> I can't wait for school to be over.
00:45:25 <DuB`> I want to read an actual book that isn't a textbook.
00:45:37 <DoT`> yea that sucks
00:45:38 <DuB`> Haven't dug into a good scifi/fantasy in months.
00:45:48 <DuB`> Wanna re-read Dune!
00:45:55 <DoT`> want to read but spend all day looking at text books so you really cant bear to pick up another book
00:46:09 <DuB`> Yep yep.
00:48:50 <carcinisation> get audiobook
00:48:57 <carcinisation> the dune one is good
00:49:31 <carcinisation> you can listen on way to class
00:50:49 <DoT`> hmm, maybe i should dl that, i need something to listen to while trying to sleep
00:51:27 <DuB`> You people.
00:51:31 <DuB`> Sleep time is for sleeping.
00:51:34 <DuB`> Not reading!
00:51:54 <carcinisation> it should last you a while dot
00:52:22 <DuB`> I find it a bit hard to get much out of a book when I'm somewhere between 50%-100% asleep as I'm reading it.
00:52:24 <DuB`> >.>
00:52:25 <carcinisation> ppl need to stop check raising me D:
00:52:53 <DoT`> dub, if i dont have sometihng it can take hours to get to sleep, my brain refuses to not think on things
00:53:12 <DuB`> Hmm.
00:53:22 <DuB`> Do what I do and wake up at 4am every morning. 
00:53:28 <DuB`> Then you'll be too tired to NOT sleep! :D
00:54:21 <DoT`> 2 nights ago it decided i had to ponder that with time being relative to speed, and the galaxy spins, whats the time diffrence between the center and edge
00:54:30 <DoT`> please brain, im no physiccst

21:41:48 <DuB`> Well it's not SUPPOSED to make it to the road.
21:42:00 <DuB`> Just like F1 cars aren't.
21:42:05 <DuB`> Proofs of concept and technology.
21:42:15 <Phearlaptop> They should make an off-road concept car
21:42:25 <Phearlaptop> They could sell that since it wouldn't have to end up on the road =) =) =)

23:11:09 <skrma> did gaben ever respond to all the shanghai fails?
23:11:14 <skrma> i have not been paying attention
23:11:37 <DoT`> MICEN
23:11:39 <DoT`> hello
23:11:42 <Micen> hello
23:11:53 <Phearlaptop> Valve released an official thing that said basically boiled down to "shit was fucked yo, we'll try not let that happen again".
23:12:06 <Phearlaptop> But they said it all official-like
23:12:18 <skrma> lol
23:12:29 <Phearlaptop> shortly after this statement the hotel packed up all the players gear and EE's totoro plushie without anyone knowing.
23:12:32 <Micen> nice map Dot. 
23:12:41 <Phearlaptop> AFaik some gear is still missing
23:12:50 <Phearlaptop> Idk if EE got his plushie back
23:14:08 <skrma> sad
23:14:38 <Phearlaptop> But yeah now lots of ppl in china saying who did what and why things went so badly for both the chinese teams and the event itself.
23:14:53 <Phearlaptop> Idk what exactly to make of this as it's nothing official and all translated stuff
23:15:45 <Phearlaptop> But yeah china doto is feed. Hopefully they'll recover.
23:15:54 <Phearlaptop> I'm not a huge china doto supporter but, this was just sad.
23:17:36 <Camail> my hand is pretty worn out bio\
23:17:59 <Phearlaptop> On the bright side I think PGL are doing the Manila major. They should know how stuff works
23:18:21 <Phearlaptop> I am optimistic.
23:18:43 <Rawr|Fone> The chinese teams are all switching players now
23:18:46 <skrma> no yames doe :(
23:19:07 <Rawr|Fone> James is an ass though
23:19:16 <Phearlaptop> Some people are ass-men
23:19:38 <DoT`> .is james an ass
23:19:49 <skrma> james is my kind of ass rawr
23:20:02 <Phearlaptop> I'll agree to that. I enjoy his ass-ness, but I can live without it.
23:21:17 <Rawr|Fone> I think he is funny most of the time
23:24:59 <Camail> Bio  that guy who rage quit on inferno added me to his friends list...
23:25:55 <DoT`> lol
23:26:23 <Bio> did he day anything
23:27:35 <Bio> I have 80 wins
23:27:43 <Bio> and DoT` DuB` can't even get 10 T)T
23:27:44 <Bio> T_T
23:27:59 <Rawr|Fone> Lazypons
23:28:17 <DuB`> :O
23:31:43 <Camail> nah just an invite
23:31:50 <Camail> which i rejected because idc its my smurf
23:32:21 <Camail> but yea confirmed dub and dot are both soggy dog turds
23:33:21 <DuB`> Gotta fight gotta shoot gotta undertale.
23:33:33 <DoT`> dont forget One punch dub
23:33:53 <Bio> and once open beta comes, all you will do is oberwadje
23:34:00 <DuB`> Yus.
23:34:00 <Bio> though to be fair, so will I
23:34:59 <ZK> DuB`, you forgot you need to craft stars :p
23:35:04 <DuB`> Waaah.
23:36:39 <Camail> or just like
23:36:41 <Camail> do one of them
23:40:03 <Bio> shoots went okay I think
23:40:12 <Bio> I am still 2panicy
23:40:43 <Bio> lots of times I feel like I'm lingering on a site too long now and i'm no help
23:41:51 <Camail> just gotta find a spot and commit to it
23:41:57 <Camail> on b in inferno its usually the back
23:42:01 <Camail> or like 2nd oranges
23:42:07 <Camail> 2nd oranges is my favorite spot
23:42:37 <Camail> if they go consturuction you can us the fountain for cover, if they come up first oranges you see their shadow really early
23:42:56 <Camail> and everyone (especially at lower levels) cares more about newbox and emo
23:43:02 <Camail> so they'll just go right passed you
23:48:31 <Bio> i c

23:50:04 <Camail> th emost important thing is this, if you're trying to look everywhere at one, you are looking nowhere
23:50:28 <Phearlaptop> Hah yeah I run into that a lot in flight sims.
23:51:04 <Camail> position yourself in a way where you can conceal yourself from every angle they could be, and peak only one angle
23:51:20 <Camail> lets your vision focus, and let your game sense and mind dicate your vulnerabilities
23:51:37 <Camail> like when you were 1v1 on b site
23:51:40 <Camail> the guy came from ct
23:51:55 <Camail> you wanted to plant, but were afraid of him goiing construction
23:52:12 <Camail> but he wouldn't have had time to get there, maybe knife out running
23:52:37 <Camail> but even then, you allow yourself to be vulnerable to construction so you can get the plant, back off, and force him onto site
23:53:17 <Bio> guess I still don't have timings down yet
23:54:28 <Camail> second guessing yourself and hesitating guarantees failure, regardless of which decision was the right one
23:54:41 <Camail> the timings are strict enough in a skirmish that you just have to decide
23:54:59 <Camail> and when you don't know, then you'll make more mistakes than not
23:55:07 <Camail> but its better than getting caught between two spots
23:56:15 <Bio> true
23:57:33 <Camail> also never ever ever pull a nade out while in a peak battle, or you know someone can peak you in the next 2 seconds
23:57:38 <Camail> it didnt happen int hese sets of games
23:57:44 <Camail> but its a really important rule
23:58:59 <Camail> like, throwing a nade at porch from top mid is usually a horrible idea because all it takes is for the arch guy to peak and fuck ur day up
23:59:02 <Bio> yeh, i've tried not to do that
23:59:13 <Camail> even if it only happen 30% of the time, thats a third of your deaths
23:59:24 <Camail> its hard to break the habit
